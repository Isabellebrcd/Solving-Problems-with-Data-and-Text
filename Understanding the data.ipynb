      "[\"University of Birmingham\\n Unit of Assessment: UoA11, Computer Science and Informatics\\n 1 Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n 1.1    Overview\\n The School of Computer Science (the UoA) is one of seven schools in the College of\\n Engineering and Physical Sciences, which in turn is one of five colleges comprising the\\n University. We are submitting 48 Category A members of staff across 5 Themes, described in\\n 1.2.\\n Over the assessment period, the School has strengthened its position as a major research\\n centre and further advanced its international standing. We are among the top 10 UK computer\\n science departments in the worldwide CS Rankings table. Ten staff were awarded prestigious\\n personal Research Fellowships. We contributed to defining University, national and international\\n research agendas through leadership of four interdisciplinary institutes, membership of planning\\n and steering committees, organisation of major international conferences, and over 60 editorial\\n board positions of international journals.\\n There has been major investment in staffing and infrastructure. Of the returned 48 Category A\\n staff, 22 joined during the assessment period, and for all except four this was their first academic\\n appointment. We have attracted young researchers from internationally renowned institutions,\\n including Oxford, Carnegie Mellon, Princeton, and Max Planck Institutes. Investment into\\n infrastructure and facilities (£45M+) facilitated the uptake of our research by industry and\\n beneficiaries, and subsequent impact. We strengthened our engagement with other disciplines,\\n including biosciences, engineering, humanities, law, mathematics and medicine.\\n The synergy between our fundamental and applied research has fuelled collaboration with over\\n 80 companies, from local SMEs to major international corporations. Through patents, licences\\n and collaborative projects, our activities impacted the automotive, robotics, cybersecurity,\\n education, healthcare and manufacturing sectors.\\n 1.2    Structure and outlook\\n An important strategy since the last REF has been consolidation of our research into five\\n research Themes (leads underlined below): Artificial Intelligence, Theoretical Computer\\n Science, Cyber Security, Human-Centred Computing and Computational Life Sciences. All\\n have seen substantial investment in people, geared towards promising early career researchers\\n (ECRs, 2.1.1). This has already borne fruit for interdisciplinary research (1.3.vi), income creation\\n (3.1) and impact (1.4), and bodes well for future sustainability.\\n Cyber Security (“Cyber”)\\n [Chothia, Galindo, Garcia, Ordean, Oswald, Petit, Ritter, Sinha Roy, Ryan]\\n Expertise covers a broad range of areas within computer security, including applied\\n cryptography, automotive security, cloud security, electronic voting, formal verification, secure\\n infrastructure and hardware, IoT and wireless security. Members work closely with national\\n regulatory agencies, government departments and funding bodies such as GCHQ, National\\n Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), Rail Safety & Standards Board, and Department for Digital,\\n Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS); and collaborate with major businesses including Jaguar Land\\n Rover, HP, Huawei, Microsoft, IBM, Google, Deloitte, BT and the National Grid, as well as\\n regional partners (4.1).\\n The international standing of our research was confirmed by the award of NCSC-EPSRC\\n Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research in 2017. The University’s Dynamic\\n Investment Fund has injected £5M into our work, supporting delivery of three Impact Case\\n Studies (ICS-1 automotive security, ICS-2 banking app security, ICS-3 malware detection). Five\\n                                                                                                Page 1\\n\\n\\n new appointments (Galindo, Ordean, Oswald, Petit, Sinha Roy) have strengthened expertise in\\n cryptography, security of embedded systems, hardware security and post-quantum\\n cryptography.\\n 2021-2026 Objectives: The future continuation of high-impact industry-relevant research is\\n safeguarded by Garcia’s Birmingham Fellowship (REF5a-3.4.1) followed by a 5-year EPSRC\\n Fellowship, 5-year Hewlett-Packard funding for Ryan, and a joint post with Fetch.ai for Galindo.\\n Fourteen ongoing projects, funded to a total of £3.5M by EPSRC, GCHQ and industry (HP,\\n Samsung) will contribute to future impact in car, device (TEE, IoT) and railway security (in\\n collaboration with the Birmingham Centre for Railway Research and Education, the largest\\n university-based centre of its kind in Europe), and to legal aspects of privacy.\\n Theoretical Computer Science (“Theory”)\\n [Ahrens, Backens, Chitnis, Das, Escardó, Ghica, Jung, Levy, Parker, Rahli, Reddy]\\n Theory is one of the largest research groups in the world focusing on the logical foundations of\\n computer science. Our international standing allowed us to attract winners of five competitive\\n fellowships: two Birmingham Fellowships (Ahrens, Zeilberger), two Royal Society University\\n Fellowships (Kraus, Vicary), and a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship (Das). New appointments in\\n type theory (Ahrens, Rahli), theory of quantum computation (Backens), algorithms and\\n complexity (Chitnis), verification (Rahli), and proof theory (Das) have broadened the scope of\\n our research.\\n In the last two years, we secured over £2M from Research Councils, Royal Society, EU and\\n other organisations including Microsoft (Structural Foundation for Heterogeneous Computation)\\n and DARPA (Building Resource Adaptive Software Systems). We collaborate widely and\\n productively with internationally leading researchers and institutions (4.1). Owing to our\\n exceptional strength in type theory we have been playing a leading role in the emerging field of\\n univalent mathematics through landmark publications, prolific contributions to the UniMath library\\n (Ahrens, ranked 2nd for contributions) and running successful research schools (2017, 2019). Via\\n the Midlands Graduate School in the Foundations of Computing Science (4.4) we have\\n contributed to the education of over 400 PhD students and industry professionals who will\\n sustain theoretical research into the future.\\n 2021-2026 Objectives: We will continue to build on the exceptional depth and breadth of our\\n research, and exploit the links that arise naturally between members around logic (Das, Jung,\\n Levy, Parker, Rahli), type theory (Ahrens, Escardó, Ghica, Rahli), automata theory (Das,\\n Parker), complexity (Backens, Chitnis, Das), verification (Parker, Rahli), programming languages\\n (Ghica, Levy, Reddy) and semantics (Escardo, Jung, Levy, Reddy). This will allow us to tackle\\n both foundational and practical problems in distributed computing, autonomous systems,\\n probabilistic and quantum computation, among others.\\n Artificial Intelligence (“AI”)\\n [Barnden, Chang, He, Kaban, Kerber, Lee, Lehre, Leonardis, Li, Mansouri, Minku, Rowe,\\n Sloman, Sridharan, Tiňo, Wang, Yao]\\n This Theme integrates former separate robotics, machine learning, natural computation and\\n computer vision groups with an increased focus on a common set of foundational methods. This\\n has materially contributed to the University’s successful partnership with the Alan Turing Institute\\n (ATI, REF5a-2.1.5) and has brought £5M investment which supports five fellowships in the\\n School (Kaban, Rowe, Tiňo, Sloman, Styles). We appointed seven young colleagues (Chang,\\n Lehre, Li, Mansouri, Minku, Sridharan, Wang), strengthening and interconnecting research in\\n computer vision, robotics and natural computation. Foundations of machine learning (ML) was\\n expanded by the appointment of Lehre (who has recently been awarded a Turing AI\\n Acceleration Fellowship) and the award of a 5-year EPSRC Fellowship to Kaban. Our AI\\n research has significantly benefitted from School, University and EPSRC investment in Tier-2\\n high-performance computing infrastructure (3.4).\\n                                                                                              Page 2\\n\\n\\n The significance of our foundational research can be demonstrated by the impact it has made on\\n other disciplines: Kaban’s highly cited theoretical work (ML2015, AiStats2014) found applications\\n in genomics, medicine, meteorology, defence, computer vision, traffic optimisation and many\\n others; Tiňo’s work on learning in model space underpinned novel findings on the progression of\\n Alzheimer’s disease, gravitational waves, decision making, pharmokinetic models and\\n metabolomics. Leonardis’ and Sridharan’s research on visual object tracking and grasping has\\n contributed to the development of neurorehabilitation therapies and has been employed in\\n robotic retrieval of nuclear waste. Lehre’s and Yao’s impact on the ML field is evidenced by the\\n number of citations for papers published in the assessment period: 700+ and 9000+\\n respectively. Likewise, Chang’s 2014-2020 work on computer vision and human-robot\\n interaction was cited 3000+ times and Sridharan’s ML-for-robotics research gained 450 citations.\\n Since 2014, our research standing was recognised by appointments to senior university and\\n external posts (1.3.vi) and several prestigious international awards (4.4).\\n 2021-2026 Objectives: The strength of our foundational research and our association with more\\n than 10 University of Birmingham institutes and centres (1.3.vi) provides huge opportunities for\\n future theoretical, interdisciplinary and industrial work. Applied AI research will continue to\\n contribute to security, transport, automotive, software engineering, manufacturing, society, and\\n healthcare, with most work involving ongoing worldwide collaborations with both academic\\n researchers (4.1) and industry, commerce and societal beneficiaries (4.2). The forthcoming Tier-\\n 2 facility for high-performance computing (3.4) will significantly enhance our capacity to tackle\\n real-world challenges.\\n Human-Centred Computing (“HCC”)\\n [Baber, Bahsoon, Beale, Gould, Hendley, Howes, Russell, Sorge, Yeung]\\n Three senior appointments have expanded capabilities in this Theme: Russell works in speech\\n and language science and technology, with over 150 research papers in these areas; Baber (Sir\\n Frederic Bartlett medal winner) specialises in sensor-based human-technology interaction;\\n Yeung (Interdisciplinary Professorial Fellow; 0.2 FTE CS) is contributing expertise in legal and\\n ethical implications of technological development and technology policy-making. Yeung and\\n Howes are pursuing new ideas for human rights-centred design of AI systems (The Oxford\\n Handbook of AI Ethics, 2019), an area we plan to grow in the future.\\n Other agenda-setting and highly cited publications in this Theme include a highly influential\\n publication on computational rationality (Howes, TopiCS 6(2), 140+ citations) and a ‘manifesto’\\n discussing usability, societal impact and implications of cloud computing (Bahsoon, CSUR 51(5),\\n 120+ citations). Bahsoon’s ideas on self-adaptive, self-aware and self-expressive computing\\n systems have attracted much attention, particularly in AI and software engineering communities\\n (1200+ citations for papers published since 2014). Applied research continues to deliver societal\\n impact: Baber and Russell’s interactive system CogWatch for assisting rehabilitation of stroke\\n patients is undergoing an NHS clinical trial; Sorge’s research has improved access to STEM\\n literature for millions of users with visual and print impairments worldwide (ICS-4).\\n 2021-2026 Objectives: As the impact of computing technology and AI on all aspects of society\\n accelerates, we will focus our research on three areas: investigating the societal impact,\\n explainability of, and trust in, AI, jointly with our AI and CLS colleagues in natural computation,\\n robotics, computer vision and healthcare applications; educational, ethical and governance\\n implications of AI, building on our links with the School of Law and the Finnish Center for AI; and\\n SE issues concerned with the design, building and deployment of AI-based computer systems.\\n Computational Life Sciences (“CLS”)\\n [Claridge, Dehghani, Duan, Little, Styles, Terry]\\n This inherently interdisciplinary Theme has a scientific base in AI, mathematics and physics and\\n aims to interpret data, including images, generated from a wide range of fields in the life\\n sciences and medicine, and to develop practical applications benefitting bioscience research\\n and healthcare. High-calibre appointments have broadened our expertise, opened new impact\\n avenues and expanded connections to related disciplines: Little (statistical ML for health); Duan\\n                                                                                                 Page 3\\n\\n\\n (ML for medical imaging); and Terry (0.2 FTE CS, systems modelling and quantitative\\n biomedicine, a joint appointment with Medicine and Mathematics).\\n We hold leadership positions in four Birmingham interdisciplinary institutes and are active\\n members of two health-focused centres (1.3.vi). We have made noteworthy scientific\\n contributions to the development of the field as evidenced by numerous publications in journals\\n such as the Nature-group research journals, IEEE TMI and Pattern Recognition, and highly cited\\n post-2014 papers (e.g. Dehghani: 3000+, Little: 2300+, Duan: 1000+). Our work is also\\n impacting allied disciplines as shown by publications in diverse physics, chemistry, microscopy,\\n genetics, and major medical journals. Our research is taken up by the healthcare and\\n pharmaceutical industries and healthcare organisations, translating into benefits to society (4.2).\\n We have contributed to the education of future generations of researchers through leadership of\\n two CDTs (PSIBS, Sci-Phy, 1.3.v), the international NIRFAST workshops and the EU ITN\\n BitMap.\\n 2021-2026 Objectives: Our efforts will increasingly focus on the development of ML methods\\n that lead to step changes in pre-clinical and medical imaging and data analysis, particularly in\\n multimodal optical imaging and advanced microscopies. We will draw on novel methodologies\\n from the AI Theme and benefit from having world-class university colleagues as biomedical\\n collaborators. Three top-rank 2021-starters will bring fresh theoretical ideas and expand the\\n existing interdisciplinary research links with Medicine, Biosciences and Engineering: Krull (CS\\n lecturer), a pioneer of AI-based microscopy image denoising; Guggenheim (Royal Society\\n University Research Fellow, joint with Medicine), the developer of a novel photo-acoustic\\n imaging technology; and Wheeler (Interdisciplinary Birmingham Fellow, joint with Health\\n Sciences), a data scientist joining from the Sanger Institute. Further collaborations and funding\\n opportunities will arise through the Health Innovation Campus (REF5a-4.2.2), a university-wide\\n initiative to build a state-of-the-art campus for medical research (opening in 2023).\\n 1.3     Review of REF 2014 objectives and future strategy\\n Computer Science at Birmingham focuses on long-term, fundamental research challenges of\\n relevance to the discipline and society in general. Our vision is to deliver world-class research\\n outputs and outcomes with long-lasting impact by appointing and supporting outstanding\\n young researchers, developing and attracting research leaders, training the next generation\\n of researchers, and engaging with other disciplines, industry and public services, all in a\\n supportive, collaborative and stimulating environment.\\n In the reporting period we have stayed true to this vision, and have comprehensively delivered\\n on all the strategic objectives formulated in REF2014.\\n         (i) Delivering world-class research outputs.\\n         The School is placed 7th among UK departments in CS Rankings, a table based on a\\n         department’s publication record in recognised top conferences. Our work also appears in\\n         some of the subject’s highest-ranking journals (4.1) and scores highly on citations,\\n         demonstrating the influence of our work. Given that new starters constitute nearly half of\\n         our current staff, this demonstrates the effectiveness of our support mechanisms and\\n         places us in an excellent position for the future.\\n         (ii) Delivering outcomes with long-lasting impact.\\n         The four submitted ICSs exemplify the effectiveness of our impact strategy (1.4): the spin-\\n         out company Lastline (ICS-3) provides sophisticated anti-malware products protecting\\n         over 20 million users worldwide; the Speech-Rule-Engine software (over 1M downloads\\n         since 2015) improves access to mathematical and scientific literature for visually impaired\\n         users via tools such as Google ChromeVox (ICS-4); our cybersecurity research led to\\n         improved car security, impacting on hundreds of millions of vehicles from 33\\n         manufacturers worldwide (ICS-1); and our (responsibly disclosed) work on banking apps\\n         protects tens of millions of users worldwide from fraud (ICS-2).\\n                                                                                               Page 4\\n\\n\\n       New security protocols are currently undergoing standardisation before their final\\n       deployment as a part of the European Rail Traffic Management System (4.2). Software for\\n       remote monitoring and detection of Parkinson's is used in clinical trials by leading\\n       international companies (Pfizer, UCB Biopharma). Our non-invasive screening technology\\n       for skin lesions is deployed in 35 countries worldwide. We contribute to the growth of the\\n       research base and future impact through hosting and running graduate schools and\\n       leading CDTs which, since 2014, have trained several hundred PhD students and\\n       industrial researchers (3.2). We are safeguarding future impact by actively promoting and\\n       training for entrepreneurial skills (1.4, 2.1.5).\\n       (iii) Appointing and supporting outstanding young researchers.\\n       We are proud to have been able to recruit young researchers from the most renowned\\n       institutions in the world, including Oxford, Carnegie Mellon, Princeton, Sanger and Max\\n       Planck Institutes. These appointments have allowed us to strategically grow research\\n       capacity in existing areas as well as establish new directions, such as type theory, post-\\n       quantum cryptography, AI for software engineering and photoacoustic imaging. 80% of our\\n       appointees are new entrants to lecturing careers. That they feature strongly in our\\n       research outputs (2.3) and grant capture (3.1), demonstrates both their high calibre and\\n       the effectiveness of our caring ethos and multifaceted support mechanisms (2.1.3).\\n       (iv) Developing future research leaders\\n       In addition to promoting the University’s Developing Leaders programmes (REF5a-3.4.4),\\n       we have established an active support scheme (2.1.2) where grant applications are peer-\\n       reviewed by experienced colleagues, and candidates are supported by a series of mock\\n       interviews with panels including both discipline-based and external staff. In the reporting\\n       period all fellowship applicants who reached the interview stage have been successful\\n       (3.1). Promotions to Chair (8) and Reader (6) have been actively encouraged via HoS-led\\n       Performance Development Reviews (PDRs) by inviting promising colleagues to apply\\n       (2.1.2), and by actions designed to encourage minority applicants (2.1.2, 2.3). We have\\n       supported career trajectories of staff who have taken on senior management positions in\\n       the University. This includes the appointment of Styles to the role of Director of the\\n       Institute for Interdisciplinary Data Science and AI; Baber to Deputy Director of Research\\n       for the College, and Rowe to Deputy Pro Vice-Chancellor for Strategic Projects. They all\\n       remain full members of the School and are thus able to continue to pursue their individual\\n       research agendas.\\n       (v) Training the next generation of researchers\\n       We are strongly committed to and invested in training the next generation of researchers.\\n       In the REF period 218 students (146.1 FTE) graduated under our supervision, including\\n       over 40 (14.5 FTE) interdisciplinary students in two CDTs (2.2.2). The effectiveness of our\\n       training and supervision (2.2) is evidenced by the increase in PhDs awarded (+135%) and\\n       a completion rate consistently above 80%. We have contributed to the education of over\\n       400 PhD students via the Midlands Graduate School consortium and trained tens of ECRs\\n       through the EU funded Marie Curie ITN and RISE programmes (2.2, 4.4).\\n       (vi) Engaging with other disciplines, industry and public services\\n       We have made great strides towards our long-standing aim of initiating, encouraging and\\n       supporting interdisciplinary work. We have established the Centre for Cyber Security\\n       and Privacy, one of the EPSRC-GCHQ Academic Centres of Excellence. We are co-\\n       founders of the Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Robotics, the\\n       Human-Computer Interaction Centre and the USTC-Birmingham Joint Research Centre in\\n       Intelligent Computation and Its Applications. Styles is the founding Director of the Institute\\n       for Interdisciplinary Data Science and AI.\\n       We are also active partners in the cross-institutional Centre of Membrane Proteins and\\n       Receptors, Birmingham Centre for Human Brain Health, Institute for Metabolism and\\n       Systems Research, System Science for Health Consortium, Centre for Computational\\n                                                                                               Page 5\\n\\n\\n        Biology, Centre for Predictive Modelling in Healthcare and the Birmingham Centre for\\n        Railway Research and Education.\\n        We have co-led two CDTs, Physical Sciences of Imaging in the Biomedical Sciences\\n        (PSIBS) and Physical Sciences for Health (Sci-Phy), which provide interdisciplinary\\n        training at the interface between chemistry, physics, life sciences, engineering and CS.\\n        Each student is supervised by researchers from three different disciplines, for example:\\n        CS, chemistry and biomedicine for mapping the molecular characteristics of cancer via\\n        analysis of hyperspectral mass-spectrometry data; dentistry, CS and engineering for high-\\n        speed imaging to improve dental ultrasonic plaque removal.\\n        Examples of individual collaborations and joint industrial, business, and public service\\n        projects are given in 4.1and 4.2.\\n        We have laid strong foundations for future sustainability. In addition to appointing young\\n        staff with strong interdisciplinary portfolios (Sinha Roy, Chen, Duan, Little), we helped\\n        establish two Interdisciplinary Professorial Fellow positions, in Law, Ethics and Informatics,\\n        and in Systems Modelling & Quantitative Biomedicine. Two interdisciplinary Birmingham\\n        Fellows are joining CLS. Furthermore, we have negotiated part-time contracts for five\\n        colleagues who have transitioned into an industry-sponsored research laboratory, thus\\n        fostering and facilitating the interchange of ideas between academia and industry, and\\n        opening new avenues for impact (2.1.5).\\n        (vii) Creating an inclusive, supportive, collaborative and stimulating environment\\n        We have maintained a culture of openness and inclusion demonstrated by open\\n        membership of School committees, prominence of EDI considerations in School business\\n        (2.3), no formal barriers between research Themes, equitable access to funding,\\n        resources and infrastructure, and peer sharing of research practices. Well-equipped\\n        research laboratories (3.4), cross-disciplinary links across campus, wide academic and\\n        external networks (4.1), collaborations and organisational structures supporting research\\n        and impact (3.2) and a supportive policy on flexible working (2.3), create an attractive\\n        working environment for all staff. Proactive career-development policies, training\\n        opportunities for professional and personal development, and measures for rewarding\\n        achievements, have made staff feel supported and the School appealing as a place of\\n        employment (2.1).\\n Overall, in the reporting period the above strategies have established the School as both a\\n destination for talent of the very highest calibre and a diversity of backgrounds, and a\\n collaborator of choice for partners from other disciplines and outside academia, thus contributing\\n to the growth, impact and sustainability of the discipline at a national and international level.\\n Having proved effective, these principles will continue to guide our strategy into the future.\\n 1.4    Enabling impact\\n Since 2014, the School has seen significant growth in research with reach and impact beyond\\n academia. This has resulted from the implementation of a four-point strategy (see below) which\\n will continue into the next assessment period. Strategic issues are addressed here, with further\\n details presented in later sections.\\n        Raising awareness. Impact is formally included on the agenda in PDRs for all staff,\\n        including discussion of potential opportunities and recommendations for relevant training\\n        (2.1.5). These items are also covered in induction meetings for new staff conducted by the\\n        Head of Staff Development. University-wide developments aimed at supporting impact are\\n        channelled to the School by the Deputy PVC for Research Impact (REF5a-2.1.3).\\n        Identifying opportunities. To proactively bring forthcoming opportunities to the attention\\n        of relevant staff we established a Research Facilitator post (3.3), complementing the\\n        University Research Development service (REF5a-4.1). To identify openings for\\n        exploitation with partners beyond academia we used opportunities presented by annual\\n        Research Days, annual Industrial Advisory Board meetings, career fairs, direct links\\n                                                                                                 Page 6\\n\\n\\n        through colleagues with joint industrial appointments or who took senior positions outside\\n        academia, sponsors of PhD projects, etc. (2.1.5). Our investment in interdisciplinary\\n        appointments has opened up new avenues for impact. The growth of external\\n        engagements was also fuelled by our active search for partners to exploit our basic\\n        research and by addressing the needs that we ourselves have identified.\\n        Building capacity. In recognition of the long timescales often involved in getting research\\n        “ready” for external uptake, the School has invested in lead-in measures such as\\n        specialised laboratory facilities, study leaves, small-scale grants for blue-skies\\n        investigations and travel grants for industrial visits (3).\\n        Supporting routes to commercialisation and/or dissemination. University of\\n        Birmingham Enterprise Ltd (UoBEL, REF5a-4.1) has been an important two-way route to\\n        commercialisation and dissemination. A significant proportion of staff have benefitted from\\n        enterprise training and professional assistance leading to a significant volume of patents,\\n        licenses, records of invention and spin-out companies (2.1.5). UoBEL is also acting as a\\n        broker for businesses coming to the University to access the intellectual property, know-\\n        how and expertise available in the School, including support for PIs seeking to engage\\n        with external partners. Joint appointments and other means identified above provide direct\\n        access to industry and ease translation. We are making use of the institutional EPSRC\\n        Impact Acceleration Account and business partnering provided by Innovate UK.\\n The above strategies have materially contributed to both the submitted ICSs and the abundance\\n of projects in our current impact pipeline. As an illustration: the car security (ICS-1) and secure\\n banking (ICS-2) work benefitted from investment in cybersecurity staff and laboratory equipment\\n (3.4); success of anti-malware products (ICS-3) has origins in the co-founding of a company by a\\n staff member; worldwide availability of software enabling on-line access to STEM materials for\\n the visually impaired (ICS-4) began with a study leave at Google.\\n Many of the collaborations (detailed in 4.2) have either already made significant impact in\\n important business and societal areas (e.g. secure designs for IoT, contactless card security,\\n mobile health monitoring, screening for diseases) or show strong early signs of success (e.g.\\n trustworthy voting, supply chain security, rail security protocols, engine optimisation, vehicle\\n route optimisation, adaptive software systems and architectures, cloud computing, imaging\\n techniques for drug discovery, health monitoring and diagnosis).\\n 1.5    Progress towards an open research environment\\n We are committed to compliance with the Concordat on Open Research Data and Plan-S,\\n supported by the University’s Open Research Group (REF5a-2.2). Data sets, postprints of all\\n publications and theses (unless sensitive) are submitted to the institutional repository from\\n where they become freely accessible via the University’s Research Portal (REF5a-2.2, REF5a-\\n 4.5). Like many computer science establishments, we make our software available via open\\n repositories. Examples include the probabilistic model checker PRISM (Parker et al., ~80,000\\n downloads to date), Speech Rule Engine (ICS-4, over one million downloads in 5 years),\\n software for optical molecular imaging NIRFAST (Dehghani co-lead and developer) and the\\n UniMath library of Coq code (started at Princeton with Ahrens as a key contributor). As a matter\\n of principle, the Cyber Security group releases tools and proof-of-concept code as open source.\\n Our commitment to open publishing is via editorial roles at gold open access journals including\\n Logical Methods in Computer Science, Compositionality, Mathematical Foundations of\\n Computing, Biomedical Optics Express, Medical Image Analysis, Frontiers in Psychology, Digital\\n Biomarkers and others. Where it has not been possible to publish in such outlets, we draw upon\\n the institutional open access fund (REF5a-2.2), which complements support provided by UKRI\\n and the Wellcome Trust.\\n 1.6    Research integrity\\n We adhere to the University’s Code of Practice for Research Ethics (REF5a-2.2), and provide bi-\\n annual training on research integrity, GDPR and ethical self-assessment in line with the UK\\n                                                                                                 Page 7\\n\\n\\n National Concordat to Support Research Integrity. Training is part of the induction process for\\n new staff (2.1.3) and the compulsory Research Methods module for PhD students (2.2.4). The\\n Research Ethics Officer provides internal oversight and best practice advice. No infringements\\n have occurred during the reporting period. As an illustration of the effectiveness of our\\n processes see our work in applied security (ICS-1 and 2) where the protocol for responsible\\n disclosure was followed and GCHQ/NCSC and trade bodies were informed and engaged\\n throughout.\\n                                                                                             Page 8\\n\\n\\n 2 People\\n 2.1    Staffing strategy and staff development\\n The School actively supports the career and professional development of its members at all\\n stages in adherence to the three principles of the Concordat to Support the Career Development\\n of Researchers: environment and culture (2.1.2), employment (2.1.1) and professional and\\n career development (2.1.2-2.1.5).\\n 2.1.1    Recruitment\\n Consistent with our decision to consolidate research around five Themes, we pursued\\n recruitment strategies aimed at ensuring critical mass in each, broadening the scope, enhancing\\n diversity, and building sustainability by bringing in new talent. As a result, we have expanded\\n and strengthened all the Themes: Cyber by appointing 5 academics, Theory 5, AI 6, HCC 3, and\\n CLS 3, with 80% of new recruits being first-time lecturers. Like existing Category A staff, all new\\n recruits are on open contracts (which include a probationary period, 2.1.3). We were able to\\n address succession in leadership roles internally, via promotion rather than recruitment.\\n Following our inclusiveness ethos and to ensure fair representation, all School academics are\\n engaged in the faculty search process, encouraged to suggest candidates and invited to\\n evaluate applications. Shortlisting is conducted by a group of experts in relevant areas, bearing\\n in mind the protected characteristics of candidates. Unconscious bias and diversity training is\\n provided to all staff. To enhance gender diversity, all non-male applicants are considered by the\\n shortlisting group, irrespective of whether they were longlisted. Interview panels, chaired by a\\n College representative, include at least two non-male staff members. The recruitment process is\\n overseen and monitored by the School EDI team (2.3). As a result of these actions we recruited\\n 3 female, 1 non-binary and 9 BAME academic staff members during the assessment period,\\n significantly increasing diversity among our staff.\\n 2.1.2    Support and development\\n The School supports its staff throughout all career stages, embracing a culture of collegiality,\\n intellectual stimulation and high achievement, and respecting the principles of the Concordat.\\n There are no formal barriers between the research Themes. Attendance and membership of\\n most School committees is open to all staff and PhD students. For example, our Research\\n Committee has representatives from all Themes and all levels of seniority: 3 professors, 3 senior\\n lecturers, 2 lecturers (one ECR), 2 RFs and 1 RS, of which 3 are female and 2 from ethnic\\n minority backgrounds. The most recent meeting had 7 guest participants, 3 of them lecturers\\n appointed in 2019.\\n The Head of School carries out an annual PDR for all academic staff which focuses equally on\\n personal development and the School’s strategic objectives. This includes advancing career\\n aspirations, identifying funding opportunities, enhancing leadership skills and planning pathways\\n to promotion. Material outcomes of these reviews are that: 29% of staff were promoted in the\\n assessment period, including 8 to Chairs; the School has a portfolio of 9 potential ICSs (from\\n which four were chosen for submission); and engagement with industry has significantly\\n widened (2.1.5, 4.2).\\n Staff are encouraged to take advantage of the University’s Developing Leaders programmes\\n (REF5a-3.4.4) aimed at more senior academic staff, including Senior Leadership, Research\\n Leadership, Aditi Leadership (for BAME academics) and Aurora Leadership (for female ECRs).\\n The effectiveness of these programmes can be seen in a number of research leadership roles\\n entrusted to staff from our School (1.3.iv).\\n The Workplace Wellbeing team (REF5a-3.4.5) provides an Employee Advice and Listening\\n Service to support staff facing work or personal issues, an Employee Disability Service and an\\n Occupational Health Service. In recognition of the commitment and work towards supporting\\n research staff, the University’s European HR Excellence in Research Award was renewed in\\n 2016 and 2020.\\n                                                                                                Page 9\\n\\n\\n 2.1.3   Supporting and integrating ECR staff\\n The School’s reorganisation around five Themes has facilitated the welcome and integration of\\n new colleagues through mentoring, joint PhD supervision, sharing established links with\\n industry, and encouragement to give and host weekly seminars and bring in visitors and\\n collaborators.\\n New academic staff follow a personal probationary development plan (PPDP), with 50% reduced\\n teaching and administrative loads, and are allocated a mentor to develop their initial academic\\n objectives. Oversight and support are provided by the Head of Staff Development, a senior\\n academic (Claridge). New starters also benefit from a pump-priming fund, a PhD studentship\\n and prioritised access to Research Committee support funds (3.3).\\n An extensive induction programme is provided at School, College and University levels, led\\n locally by the Head of Staff Development. At School level it comprises workshops on lecture\\n preparation, maintaining research momentum and protecting work-home balance. To develop\\n grant writing skills, Research Committee oversees an internal review process of draft\\n applications. A tangible outcome of this has been that 43% of the total 2019/20 School grant\\n capture came from projects led by new starters, although they comprise just 27% of our\\n Category A staff. A College-funded scheme provides personalised coaching by an external\\n educational expert, involving practical advice, observations, group discussions and one-to-one\\n feedback. This is well received not only as professional training but also as a means of\\n developing confidence and bonding. The University’s central induction programme is delivered\\n simultaneously to academic and professional services staff to promote future co-operation.\\n Mandatory online training covers EDI, Information Security Awareness, GDPR, and Health and\\n Safety.\\n The College offers the Postdoctoral and Early-Career Researcher Career Development and\\n Training (PERCAT) scheme to support the PDR/ECR community, covering research, teaching,\\n entrepreneurship, management, research funding, fellowships, interviewing and EDI. PERCAT\\n also gives voice to ECRs when setting College strategy. The School fully respects the\\n entitlement given by the Concordat for all PDRs and ECRs to spend 2 hours per week\\n undertaking career enhancement activities.\\n 2.1.4   Sabbaticals\\n All academic staff are encouraged to apply for sabbatical leave, and between 3 and 8 do so in\\n any one year. Subject to a compelling research or impact plan, this allows them to take a term’s\\n leave after 3 years, or a full year’s leave after 6 years of service. Applications are reviewed and\\n refined by Research Committee and the Head of School, and then forwarded to the College for\\n final approval. During the assessment period, 22 staff were granted leave. Sorge’s work\\n culminating in ICS-4 is the direct result of a one-year sabbatical spent at Google Research Labs.\\n 2.1.5   Interchange with industry, enabling and rewarding impact\\n Our strategy towards stimulating and facilitating impact is described in 1.4. Here we describe\\n concrete measures and outcomes. Further outcomes can be found in 4.2.\\n Since 2016, we have combined our annual Research Day with the meeting of the Industrial\\n Advisory Board, leading to new collaborations and PhD sponsorships. The latest 2019 Research\\n Day was dedicated to our Cyber Security work and attracted over 40 representatives from\\n commercial and governmental organisations, including Facebook, Lloyds Bank, PwC, Huawei,\\n KPMG, Honda, BAE Systems, Capgemini, HP, and the National Cyber Security Centre. This\\n successful format will be repeated annually, the next topic covering programming languages and\\n verification research.\\n In the reporting period, about a third of our academic and PGR staff attended University of\\n Birmingham Enterprise (UoBEL) training sessions, including Medici Enterprise Skills seminars\\n on topics including consultancy, collaboration with business, licensing a technology and\\n spinning-out a company. Via UoBEL, 13 staff carried out consultancy work; 3 spin-out\\n companies have been established (CloudTomo, 3D Engine, Mokkapot) and more are in the\\n pipeline; 6 patent applications have been filed and granted, and a further 5 applied for; 30\\n                                                                                               Page 10\\n\\n\\n records of invention have been registered, 4 new licenses signed, and 6 IP agreements granted.\\n Sectors include automotive, autonomous robotics, cybersecurity, education, healthcare and\\n manufacturing.\\n The increased openness to industry also generated new career opportunities for staff. For\\n example, Ryan is now funded 80% by HP, Leonardis and Ghica are seconded 80% to Huawei\\n Research Labs, and Galindo 80% to Fetch.ai. Sorge has taken his research (ICS-4) as the basis\\n for the spin-out company Progressive Accessibility Solutions. Links back to the School have\\n been retained to facilitate knowledge transfer and provide career opportunities for students and\\n PGRs.\\n Staff whose research substantially contributed to industrial innovation, economic or societal\\n impact were promoted to chairs (Dehghani, Garcia, Ghica, Sorge).\\n 2.2     Support and training of research students\\n Our PhD student population has undergone substantial growth in both numbers and diversity.\\n The total number of PhDs awarded increased by 135%, from 57 in the previous REF period to\\n 134 in 2014-2019 (Covid-19 related extensions affected the 2019/20 numbers). We attract\\n students from diverse ethnic backgrounds; the non-white proportion of PGRs stands at 63%,\\n having grown by 71% from 38 to 65. 29.4% of our PhD students identify as female, slightly\\n above the HESA sector benchmark of 26.9% and, typically, 16% of joiners are mature students.\\n 2.2.1    Recruitment\\n The School encourages its members (especially ECRs) to advertise the availability of PhD\\n scholarships to their research communities. Applications are received and processed by Central\\n Admissions who at this stage do not collect information about protected characteristics thus\\n ensuring unbiased handling. Promising applicants are interviewed by the prospective supervisor\\n and one further academic. A team led by the Director of Postgraduate Admissions then makes\\n decisions about offers of funding, based on academic promise and the balance across\\n supervisors, and mindful of EDI issues.\\n 2.2.2    Studentships\\n The School benefits from a wide range of sources for PhD funding. In the reporting period the\\n EPSRC DTA funded over 20 students. More than 40 (co-supervised) students were supported\\n by the EPSRC CDTs PSIBS and Sci-Phy, a quarter of whom benefitted from collaboration and\\n in-kind assistance from external partners including NPL, QinetiQ, AstraZeneca, Thermo Fisher\\n Scientific, Renishaw, and UCB. GCHQ funded 8 Cyber Security PhDs. 14 PhDs were supported\\n by the Birmingham-SUSTech split-site programme. Six students were competitively co-funded\\n by Birmingham-Melbourne Priestley Scholarships (REF5a-2.1.8). Industrially funded\\n studentships were provided by, among others, Honda Europe and Jaguar Land Rover.\\n Institutional funds were used creatively to augment externally funded projects and to provide\\n ECRs with their first supervision experience; more than 50 PGRs were supported in this way.\\n 2.2.3    Monitoring and support\\n Research students work with one or two supervisors with whom they meet on a weekly basis. A\\n Thesis Group adds support of two further academics; it meets twice yearly to consider a report\\n by the student, to engage in detailed technical discussions and to follow through a checklist of\\n skills needs and general well-being. If any potential problem is identified, remedial action is\\n recommended, including training or outside expert help. Thesis Group reports are subsequently\\n reviewed and actioned by the Research Student Monitoring Group (RSMG). A key step of the\\n monitoring process is the Thesis Proposal, a substantial report due 12 months after admission.\\n Its acceptance by RSMG almost always indicates successful completion of the PhD programme.\\n A completion rate well above 80% since 2007 attests to the effectiveness of our processes.\\n 2.2.4    Skills development and career preparation\\n PhD students are provided with a range of opportunities to help them prepare for future careers.\\n During their first year, they complete a formal Research Skills module run by the School. Thesis\\n Groups refer students to training courses offered by the University Graduate School and the\\n                                                                                               Page 11\\n\\n\\n Birmingham Academic Skills Gateway, to meet development needs in line with Vitae’s\\n Researcher Development Framework (REF5a-3.2). Teaching training is offered to all PGRs who\\n work as Teaching Assistants. Subject-specific training is provided by summer schools to which\\n several members of the School contribute (4.4), and every PhD student is guaranteed\\n participation.\\n In line with the expectations of our discipline, PhD students are encouraged to disseminate their\\n results at international conferences and to further their careers by networking at such events.\\n The largest part of our research support fund is used to enable conference visits.\\n Conversely, our research students contribute to the life of the School by active membership of\\n committees, playing a particularly important role in Research and Liaison committees. In our\\n participative culture they feel free to take their own initiatives, contributing to the vibrancy of the\\n School’s research life. One example is CSoC Research Training, a PhD-led series of sessions\\n running since 2015; in addition to science subjects, topics include research ethics, thesis\\n evaluation, publication reviews and handling rejections. Cake Talks, informal meetings\\n combining research networking and socialising, have continued since 2002 as have Lab\\n Lunches. To celebrate success we have introduced twice-yearly showcasing events where\\n recently graduated research students present their work.\\n 2.3    Supporting equality and diversity\\n The University is a charter member of Athena SWAN and Race Equality Charter, holding Bronze\\n Awards in both. It is also one of the awardees of the EPSRC Inclusion Matters scheme led by a\\n School professor (Rowe). An EDI Lead (Baber) provides local leadership, supported by\\n University and College EDI officers. Examples of initiatives, both staff- and student-originated,\\n include posters celebrating LGBT computer scientists, naming School rooms after female\\n computing pioneers and successfully promoting participation in the BCS Women network, Ada\\n Lovelace Days, Black History Month and similar events. EDI is a standing item on the agenda of\\n all the main School committees.\\n Over 25% of our academic staff and 63% of PGRs are drawn from ethnic minorities. 29.4% of\\n our PhD students identify as female, but gender balance of academic staff remains a challenge.\\n Under our new recruitment regime (2.1.1) the proportion of non-male staff in the REF period\\n grew from a low of 2 to 5, an increase from 4% to 10%. Two female staff are professors; one\\n was promoted in 2018 as a direct result of targeted support by the School Staffing Committee.\\n We actively participate in actions aimed at levelling opportunities for female staff. The School\\n instigated female-specific grant writing workshops run by Professor Averil MacDonald. Claridge\\n is a member of the Female Professors Network which provides input on gender-related issues to\\n University senior management. She contributes to the University-wide seminar series Inspiring\\n Women. Backens was a speaker in London Hopper Colloquium 2020.\\n The School implements the University’s supportive policy on flexible working (REF5a-3.4.5). All\\n requests for parenting or caring leave (from staff of any gender) were granted. Seminars and\\n School events are timed to accommodate all members with parental duties.\\n Outputs for this REF submission were selected according to quality, employment status\\n (preferring category-A), and career stage. As a result, 34% of our submissions are by new\\n starters although they constitute only 29% of the author pool. The team overseeing this process\\n underwent EDI training and followed the University’s REF Code of Practice to ensure that the\\n submission is truly representative of diversity of the School. All staff were invited to contribute to\\n the writing of this environment template and the 2020 Research Day was devoted to a\\n discussion of our future research priorities.\\n                                                                                                  Page 12\\n\\n\\n 3 Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n 3.1     Research funding and income strategy\\n Our strategy for 2014-2021 was to:\\n     \\uf0b7    make strategic appointments to diversify and access new funding streams (1.2, new CLS\\n          Theme);\\n     \\uf0b7    recruit talented staff with strong potential to attract research income (2.1.1);\\n     \\uf0b7    strengthen operational infrastructure to support staff in grant capture, from preparation to\\n          submission and post-award (3.3);\\n     \\uf0b7    provide staff with the time to prepare competitive applications, using supportive PDRs\\n          (2.1.2) and responsive workload management.\\n The successful implementation of our income strategy has led to an overall 84% increase, from\\n £11.4M in REF2014 to £20.9M in this assessment period, with growth in all major funding\\n streams.

We offer a unique environment that facilitates a broad\\n range of impacts by bringing research, business and societal stakeholders together. This stems\\n from our long-standing strategy centred around research excellence with real-world application:\\n “we build what we study and we study what we build”. This mantra values meaningful\\n engagement with stakeholders at the heart of what we do, including testbeds in daily use by\\n stakeholder groups, as much as excellence in terms of publications. We believe that addressing\\n many of the major societal challenges requires an inherently diverse and interdisciplinary\\n perspective. SCC is actively driving this interdisciplinary agenda across the University in areas\\n including data science, cyber-security and social futures. This collaborative approach has led to\\n a step change in the quality of the research environment for our staff and students, and given\\n rise to major new research directions, such as environmental data science.\\n Every RAE/REF period to date has seen growth in breadth and depth of our research outputs\\n and impact (Table 1). In the last period we have increased our research income, publications in\\n SciVal, and top-10% field weighted citations index\\n Table 1: Key indicators for the REF2021 period as an evidence of sustainability (research\\n income is according to HESA as spent for the period; the value of awards for the REF2021\\n period is £39.4M with £9.3M in 2020)\\n   Indicators                                 RAE2001       RAE2008       REF2014    REF2021\\n   Research income (£M)                           6.7          15.0          18.8       28.5\\n   PhDs awarded (FTE)                             61           62.5           114        141\\n   Total number of publications                  471           1555          1848       2427\\n   Peer reviewed publications indexed in\\n                                                 147            646          1136       1645\\n   SciVal\\n   Publications in Top-10% most cited             24            182           356        447\\n   field weighted\\n   Engagement / KE Income (£M)                     -            4.1           7.8        8.6\\n   Overall research quality profile                5           80%           91%\\n   (1-5* or % 4* /3*)\\n Our achievements since 2014 include:\\n          i) our highest ever research income generation;\\n          ii) the largest number of peer reviewed publications, with\\n                                                                                               Page 1\\n\\n\\n           iii) above discipline norm field weighted citation index1;\\n           iv) most significant engagement and knowledge exchange (KE) income;\\n           v) largest number of PhDs graduated; and,\\n           vi) most significant period for progression and diversity of staff.\\n  Our performance is in line with Russell Group research intensive institutions and our number of\\n  citations per paper is above the Group median (10.3).\\n  SCC Structure\\n  We attribute this success to our strong commitment to provide an open and collaborative\\n  environment that fosters interdisciplinary working. Staff are members of research groups\\n  that synergise collaboration, provide informal mentorship and peer support. Staff also associate\\n  with University Research Centres and Institutes to increase critical mass in priority areas by\\n  working with other disciplines.\\n  SCC’s academic staff (49.45FTE up from 43.25FTE in 2014) currently comprise nine groups\\n  listed with the core areas where we make a significant intellectual contribution:\\n       \\uf0b7 Software Engineering - code analysis, defect prediction, software testing, program repair,\\n           developer human factors;\\n       \\uf0b7 Networking - Software Defined Networking, Network Functions Virtualisation, resilience\\n           and network security;\\n       \\uf0b7 Distributed Systems - Middleware, Cloud Computing, Green Computing, IoT, Self-\\n           adaptive Systems, Complex Systems;\\n       \\uf0b7 Interactive Systems - New forms of sensing interaction, input, actuation and display; novel\\n           interaction modalities and toolkits; design-led prototyping;\\n       \\uf0b7 Pervasive Systems - Development, deployment and evaluation of mobile and pervasive\\n           computing systems; ‘in-the-wild’ deployments; display networks;\\n       \\uf0b7 Communication Systems - Development, design, and performance evaluation of new\\n           concepts and techniques for wireless communication;\\n       \\uf0b7 Security - Critical Infrastructure Protection, Systemic Cyber Security Risk Management,\\n           Threat Intelligence and Data, Systems Security;\\n       \\uf0b7 Data Science - NLP, explainable AI, ML, computer vision, deep learning;\\n       \\uf0b7 Digital Health - Digital technology to transform healthcare delivery and empower\\n           individuals’ active and healthy lifestyle.\\n  Centres and Institutes build cross-institutional collaboration and drive research.\\n  A key outcome of SCC’s collaborative approach was the creation and co-leadership of three of\\n  the four flagship university-wide Institutes: Data Science (DSI, Davies), Social Futures (ISF,\\n  Harper) and Security Lancaster (SL, Suri). The Institutes recognise that computing is at the\\n  centre of understanding and shaping modern society, requiring a multi-disciplinary perspective.\\n  They create critical mass and community, and leverage expertise from across the University in\\n  areas of high strategic importance. The Institutes are a tremendous resource for SCC staff in\\n  terms of mentorship and engagement. Dedicated activities and resources stimulate\\n  collaboration, e.g. research retreats, grant preparation workshops, invited talks, visits and\\n  visitors. We also lead several established cross-department centres e.g. in corpus linguistics\\n  (UCREL), and encourage new grass roots centres to emerge, e.g. intelligent systems (LIRA).\\n  Engagement of research within teaching and knowledge exchange is a key part of our culture\\n  and environment. Onsite business engagement staff provide bespoke support for translational\\n  impact by building relationships and working with stakeholders. Co-located businesses are\\n  selected to maximise potential for engagement and knowledge transfer.\\n  It is notable that all our academics have eligible outputs and we have the lowest ratio (7%) of\\n  staff on teaching-only contracts nationally2. This is three times lower than that of other UK\\n1\\n  Twice the UK mean for Computer Science, and comparable with the Russell Group of leading\\nresearch intensive Universities.\\n2\\n  As evidenced by HESA data.\\n                                                                                                Page 2\\n\\n\\n Universities and demonstrates an approach to research-led teaching that is firmly aligned to the\\n school’s ethos of research excellence.\\n Our collaborative spirit is evidenced by the composition of our outputs: more than half (55.44%)\\n of publications are co-authored by international authors, half of our grants (49%) within the REF\\n period involve partners from other Universities including 19% international. A further 29% involve\\n SMEs, 15% large corporations (half of which are international), and an additional 7% of our\\n grants involve other stakeholder groups such as healthcare, charity, local government and social\\n enterprise.\\n 1.2 RESEARCH AND IMPACT STRATEGY DURING THE ASSESSMENT PERIOD\\n Our research takes a real-world, systems-oriented and interdisciplinary focus. This involves\\n external stakeholders in the creation of experimental testbeds and deployments. The academic,\\n business and societal impact of this strategy is best illustrated by our wide ranging impact case\\n studies: micro:bit (over 4M devices worldwide promoting computer science education); B4RN\\n (an innovative co-operative offering the fastest rural fibre broadband in UK, providing gigabit\\n access to digital services to over 5,000 homes in 79 parishes, with global influence); Smart\\n Water (transforming the efficiency of urban surface water management by 20% using pervasive\\n computing, in over 100 locations); and, marketing insights from comparative linguistics tools\\n (spun out as Relative Insight, now with offices in New York and London, and major platform\\n clients including Samsung).\\n These impacts result directly from our 2014 – 2020 strategy to:\\n      \\uf0b7   Maximise real world relevance through interdisciplinary collaboration and target\\n          more ambitious collaborative research bids – evidenced through the creation and\\n          leadership of 3 interdisciplinary research Institutes;\\n      \\uf0b7   Structure for research excellence by bringing academics in previously separate\\n          departments together to tackle problems from multiple perspectives – evidenced through\\n          the creation of 3 new research groups and 2 new University Centres, the maturation of\\n          groups to centres, and centres to institutes;\\n          Maximise impacts by working with partners & stakeholders, via embedding on-site\\n          and dedicated knowledge exchange support – evidenced through increase in the number\\n          of full-time KE staff; refresh of on-site businesses based on collaboration potential; and\\n          work with worldwide partners including Microsoft, BBC, BT, Google, SITA Aero, QinetiQ,\\n          Philips, Airbus, Huawei, and over 1,000 SMEs. e.g. flagship projects such as the £5M\\n          NG-CDI prosperity partnership with BT; and three industrial accelerators: £6M GM Cyber\\n          Foundry, £1.36M SPRITE+, and £1.5M SecureD University Enterprise Zone.\\n 1.2.1 Progress against Strategic Aims for Research & Impact identified in the REF2014\\n The strategy of the School to undertake interdisciplinary research; structure for research\\n excellence; and maximise impact creates an environment in which researchers are stimulated to\\n address new challenges, explore new ideas and solve open real-world problems by working\\n collaboratively. Our sub-goals under this strategy included: setting ourselves ambitious EDI\\n targets (>10FTE female staff by 2026), increased our research leadership by targeting major\\n fellowships; and targeting more significant and ambitious scale research bids - a minimum of\\n one £1M+ bid pa per group. We have made substantial progress:\\n Objective 1 – Interdisciplinary Research Growth. 1) Nurture our key strengths-in-depth; 2)\\n Grow new strengths on the foundation of our core research groups; and, 3) Maximise real-world\\n relevance through cross-disciplinarity. We also sought to resource key growth areas with a view\\n to increasing our leadership more strategically.\\n Demonstrably achieved by:\\n      a) Co-establishing three University interdisciplinary research Institutes (section 3.1) that cut\\n          across our research portfolio in strategically important ways - all under SCC academic\\n                                                                                                 Page 3\\n\\n\\n         staff leadership from their inception. The Institutes provide a sustainable vehicle for our\\n         research; facilitate the cross-fertilisation of ideas; as well as offering training, community,\\n         and critical mass to focus toward large strategic grants. As exemplars of this success,\\n         over a 5 year period, DSI has secured £23M to Lancaster and established new cross-\\n         disciplinary partnerships such as Centre for Environmental Data Science (CEEDS) with\\n         UKCEH. Security Lancaster (SL) has become a twice-accredited NCSC cyber-security\\n         centre of excellence, home to the £11.8M UK national hub for social science research on\\n         security threats (CREST), and £8.8M of regional cyber industrial accelerators.\\n     b) Creating and Leading two inter-disciplinary research centres:\\n         1) LIRA Centre for Robotics and Autonomous Systems, founded in 2018 (Director:\\n         Angelov) comprising 50 academics including a mix of experienced research leaders\\n         (Fellows of IEEE, ACM, IET, ASAS) as well as developing early career researchers from\\n         SCC, Engineering, Lancaster Environment Centre, Faculty of Health and Medicine, and\\n         Management School. LIRA has 8 themes: fundamentals and challenge driven areas\\n         such as Biomedical, Environment and Agriculture, Intelligent Transport, Advanced\\n         Manufacturing, Nuclear Decommissioning, Security and Defence and Society and\\n         Human Behaviour.\\n         2) Centre of Digital Health and Quality of Life Technologies, founded in 2019 (Director:\\n         Helal). Created in partnership with the Department of Health Research, CDH-QLT\\n         focuses on using digital technologies to take a proactive approach to health, with the aim\\n         of preventing illness and improving quality of life. The centre is developing innovative\\n         digital health platforms, future degree programmes, and increasing community\\n         engagement.\\n     c) We cemented bridges between University departments with two new senior joint\\n         appointments including Helal (SCC and Division of Health Research), and Harper (SCC\\n         and Social Futures).\\n Due, in part, to this strategy, the amount of funded research to SCC has grown from £18.8M to\\n £28.5M according to HESA.\\n Objective 2 – Structured for Research Excellence. 1) Maximise academic impact; 2)\\n Maximise academic synergies; 3) Boost the strategic role of the research groups.\\n Demonstrably achieved by strengthening our core research groups and founding three others.\\n This is exemplified by the journey of the security group, which rapidly evolved during the REF\\n period: moving from an SCC group to a leading research institute by combining our strengths,\\n targeting appointments, and crossing disciplines to meet the evolving needs of our partners (for\\n example the Home Office and GCHQ).\\n     a) Successfully sustained our core research groups (Networking, Distributed Systems,\\n         Interactive Systems, Pervasive Systems, Communications and Software Engineering)\\n         each with a long track record of excellence. Significant grant awards (>£1M value) have\\n         followed (Hutchison 2014; Race 2017 – converged network infrastructures); Distributed\\n         Systems (Blair 2016 – Environmental Data Science); Pervasive Systems (Sas 2017 –\\n         Affective Computing; Harper 2018 – Material Social Futures); Interactive Systems\\n         (Alexander 2020 – Deformable Screens).\\n     b) Establishing three new groups (Data Science, Security and Digital Health) in response to\\n         emerging societal challenges such as the data deluge, the need for secure and resilient\\n         infrastructures, and the aging population. Major activity includes supporting the newly\\n         opened £41M Health Innovation Campus; 1M+ grants (Prince 2019); and the hire of\\n         Distinguished Prof. Suri, bringing leadership of a major EU Cybersecurity Competence\\n         Network (CONCORDIA) to Lancaster.\\n The academic impact of our work has grown. We have seen a 44.8% growth (1136 to 1645) of\\n peer reviewed publications indexed in SciVal. Our publications in the top-10% most cited (field\\n weighted for computer science) have increased by 26% from 356 to 447 and now represent\\n more than a quarter (27.2%) of the SciVal indexed peer reviewed publications. Our work has\\n                                                                                                  Page 4\\n\\n\\n garnered peer recognition, for example, in HCI we’ve received over a dozen best paper awards\\n from ACM CHI (including Karnik, 2014, Friday 2015, Gellersen, 2019, Sas, 2019 and 2020).\\n Objective 3 – Impact. 1) Maximize impact through KE; 2) Exploit the new role of Head of\\n Business Partnerships and Enterprise.\\n Under the oversight of Head of Business Partnerships and Enterprise, who is integrated into\\n SCC’s management team, to ensure regular and effective communication; our strategy to\\n maximise impact from our research through two principal approaches: 1) investing in 3.8 FTE of\\n KE staff embedded directly within all School activities, and 2) careful choice of co-located\\n resident companies and business partners to maximise the potential for knowledge exchange\\n and impact. The structured resident support scheme and targeted company recruitment mean\\n companies entering the facility have a research collaboration plan in place. This investment\\n creates a unique environment making engagement and industry collaboration integral to our\\n operation. Income from collaborative research has grown from £2M to £3M since 2014;\\n consultancy income more than doubled year on year from around £40K in 2014 to over £100K in\\n 2019; and contract research follows the same profile, topping £1M for the first time in 2019\\n (Figure 1).\\n SCC’s impact strategy has directly led to the School’s three recent KTPs (Upside Energy; JBA;\\n Mitigate Cyber) and enabled two of its four Impact Case Studies. Beyond co-located SMEs, the\\n school engages with 150 SMEs through the £6M Greater Manchester Cyber Foundry, 90 SMEs\\n through the £1.36M Lancashire Cyber Foundry and 250 SMEs through the Cumbria Innovation\\n Platform (directly linked to our growth in contract research income above). SCC’s industry\\n linkages have been instrumental to successes including Department of Health funded\\n Connected Health Cities (CHC), £5M NG-CDI Prosperity Partnership and PETRAS. Since its\\n inception, SCC and Infolab21’s co-location model, has provided the template for impact and\\n engagement across the University, leading to similar instantiations in Chemistry (CTAP) and\\n Environmental Science (Gordon Manley Centre), the backbone of the recent £1.5M SecureD\\n University Enterprise Zone, and template for the £41M Health Innovation Campus, featuring the\\n same embedded model of collocated business, KE and academic departments. This has led to a\\n broad range of non-academic impact types including educational (22.7%), cultural (18.2%),\\n policy (13.6%), productivity and public engagement (9.1% each). Current KE return data\\n suggests as an institution we are highly effective at KE, with £28 returned for each £1 of public\\n money spent.\\n 1.3 FUTURE STRATEGY AND PLANNING\\n Lancaster University’s main strategic goal is to be a global leader in HE, widely respected and\\n transforming lives, communities, practices and thinking. In SCC, we anticipate continuing our\\n principal ethos of embedding real-world focus, deploying systems, responsible innovation with\\n stakeholders, and interdisciplinarity at the heart of what we do. We see this as being both true to\\n                                                                                               Page 5\\n\\n\\n our long-standing approach to research, but also has resulted in growth in the quality, depth and\\n number of outcomes as highlighted in section 1.1.\\n Over the coming REF period we will be seeing the retirement of a small number of longstanding\\n valued colleagues who helped establish the current collaborative culture. We will be considering\\n how to consolidate and share this culture going forward as we plan to make a number of hires to\\n maintain established strengths (e.g. networking, software engineering, HCI) and capitalise on\\n areas where we have made major investments in staff and research infrastructure including\\n cyber-security, data science and digital health.\\n     \\uf0b7   Investing in people. We have made a major investment in staff and now have a\\n         substantial cohort of 23 ECR staff, who we wish to mature into research leaders. We are\\n         proactive in promoting staff, and have been highly successful at making strong cases:\\n         leading to 11 new SL/readers and 7 new professors (9 promoted) in the last period. We\\n         need to continue to invest in training, progression and mentorship, with a particular focus\\n         on ensuring that we maintain our balanced approach to engagement and teaching, as\\n         well as aspiring to maximise research quality and impact.\\n     \\uf0b7   Growing the scale pipeline. We see centres and institutes continuing: the Institutes\\n         have just undergone an external 5-yearly review, and we anticipate the existing Centres\\n         and Institutes continuing well into the next REF period. We anticipate a period of\\n         consolidation and restructuring of groups within SCC to maximise staff desires to engage\\n         with multiple interest areas and on cross-disciplinary themes. We plan to improve the\\n         external communication of our research to best reflect this innovative structure.\\n     \\uf0b7   Enabling interdisciplinarity and engagement. Collaboration and engagement with\\n         stakeholders in our research are consistent with our goal to maximise real-world\\n         relevance through cross-disciplinarity. We see this continuing, especially within areas\\n         including resilient infrastructures, security, pervasive systems, digital health and\\n         associated testbeds (5GRIT lead: Race; AffecTech lead: Sas). The Health Innovation\\n         Campus (lead: Helal), and potential development of Eden Project North (digital\\n         environment, lead: Blair) and Whyndyke Garden Village (an NHS Healthy New Town,\\n         lead: Helal) will provide ideal environments for this style of user engaged research.\\n     \\uf0b7   Educational and recruitment pipeline. Continuing recent practice, the school will\\n         continue to sponsor research internships to encourage the brightest and most\\n         enthusiastic students to engage with research from undergraduate level, leading to\\n         further postgraduate study and ultimately in some cases, successful research careers.\\n         We created two honorary early career fellowships named after two influential former\\n         colleagues (Shepherd, Parkes) who exemplified the best aspects of the Lancaster\\n         culture, in order to hire staff in their mould to continue to recruit and build the Lancaster\\n         ethos; we will likely do this again in the coming period. Investing in people who are\\n         balanced and enthusiastic academics, and open to our style of collaborative and\\n         stakeholder engaged style of research remains at the heart of our future plans.\\n The Covid-19 pandemic has given us a glimpse of flexible ways of working especially in terms of\\n how we engage with our research peers nationally and internationally. Our community has\\n remained active and resilient during this challenging time, which gives us confidence that our\\n long-term future strategic plans are achievable. We will be looking to take the best features from\\n new ways of working to ensure the vitality and sustainability of our research into the future.\\n                                                                                                  Page 6\\n\\n\\n 2. People\\n   Key highlights\\n       \\uf0b7 Growing the school staff by 14% in support of strategic priority areas, of which, 74%\\n           are ECR as part of our commitment to new vitality\\n       \\uf0b7 Complementing ECR with 4 senior hires in strategic areas, 2 supporting increased\\n           interdisciplinary activity\\n       \\uf0b7 Improved support for PGR and PhD students – helping on-time completion rise from\\n           64% to 78%\\n       \\uf0b7 Increased staff diversity including growth in female PDRAs, lecturers and senior staff\\n           including recruiting Hall (now Deputy Head of School) and advancing Sas (Faculty\\n           Assistant Dean of Research Enhancement).\\n 2.1 STAFF\\n Strategy. Our staff have always been, and remain SCC’s overriding priority and strength. We\\n foster a supportive and openly collegiate environment, which provides excellent opportunities for\\n both intellectual and personal growth. The school currently has 49.45FTE Category A staff\\n comprising 14 Professors, 15 readers/senior lecturers and 22 lecturers. Our research\\n achievements are only possible with the support with our excellent project related research staff,\\n we employed 84 research associates during the period.\\n We see this vibrant and growing community of staff and alumni as a key outcome of our people\\n strategy set out in 2014; to ‘foster critical mass’, ‘grow key new areas’, and ‘maintain balance\\n between leadership and new talent. In terms of critical mass, the school has grown, in absolute\\n terms by 14% (from 43.25 FTE in 2014, to 49.45 FTE). The modest increase in absolute\\n headcount hides an underlying refresh of staff (33.7 FTE new staff since 2014), driven partly by\\n our strategic aims, but also by natural career progression especially of some of our more senior\\n staff. This has allowed us to rebalance our staff mix with 74% of our hires being early career\\n and support the growth of key new areas into new research groups/areas.\\n To maintain balance, we have also made 4 Professorial appointments, two of which demonstrate\\n an intentional deepening of interdisciplinarity (Helal – joint with Division of Health, Harper – joint\\n with Sociology, via ISF) and support our aim of growing key new areas, and strengthening\\n existing groups (Hall/ Software Engineering, Suri/Cybersecurity).\\n We focused on growing our talent by putting in place school-wide improvements to staff and\\n researcher development with a focus on helping staff develop and progress at all stages of their\\n careers. This is evidenced by: having advanced 9 staff to full Professor and 5 to Reader in the\\n period; and school staff taking institutional level leadership roles, e.g., SCC staff co-direct 3 of\\n the 4 flagship interdisciplinary Research Institutes and 3 cross-faculty research centres. We\\n also made a substantial contribution to the field as a whole by helping 8 staff to progress into\\n major leadership positions nationally and internationally: e.g. Rashid now leads the Cyber\\n Security Group at Bristol; Yan is now Professor of Cyber Security at Linköping, Sweden; and\\n Whittle first as Executive-Dean of Science at Monash and now Data Institute Director at\\n Australia’s prestigious CSIRO.\\n Early career researchers (ECR). A key part of our people strategy focuses on attracting and\\n developing world-class ECRs. We value collegiality, a passion for research and for research-led\\n teaching. Early career staff are allocated to a research group, with separate research mentors\\n from the school’s senior staff. Group leads provide frequent oversight, from establishing\\n objectives, identifying aspirational publication targets, and providing ongoing career support and\\n coaching including identifying development and support needs. Objectives are regularly\\n reviewed and adapted, e.g., minimally at PDR. ECRs are actively encouraged to affiliate with\\n one or more institutes or centres to provide access to wider rolling seminar programmes,\\n research retreats, and collaboration networks.\\n Bootstrapping success. All ECR receive a start-up fund from the school to stimulate initial\\n activity. All newly appointed academics are allocated lower teaching and administrative loads\\n                                                                                                  Page 7\\n\\n\\n (50% in the first year, 75% in the second) in order to facilitate the development of their research\\n portfolio. Beyond this, the School also benefited from the University’s 50th Anniversary\\n Lectureship (AL) scheme, which sought to identify academic leaders of the future with the\\n potential to become Readers or Chairs within 5 years. The ALs are relieved from their teaching\\n load entirely for the first two years excepting optional tutoring, project supervision and guest\\n lectures.\\n Supporting research bids and fellowships. The School offers tailored support for grant bid\\n development to all staff. Grant applications go through rigorous internal review, which involves\\n feedback from at least two members of academic staff (three for EPSRC new investigator\\n awards). A PhD studentship is matched to a first successful UKRI or Fellowship award. Because\\n of these strategies, all academic staff actively apply for research grants, with success evident in\\n that 73% of academic staff are PI of a project. We have actively encouraged fellowship\\n applications in the period, and have recognised research intensity in the workload model. This\\n strategy has been effective: G. Blair, Alexander, Garraghan, Jiang, Angelov, Giotsas have been\\n awarded EPSRC, ERC, Leverhulme, ELLIS and RIPE, fellowships respectively, totalling over\\n £5M. Fellow status has been accorded to Angelov (IEEE, 2016), Helal (IEEE, 2015) and Harper\\n (ACM, 2014), as well as AAAS (Helal, 2019), CHI Academy Status (Harper, 2014) and\\n Academia Europea (Helal, 2020).\\n Encouraging leadership. We actively encourage leadership and focus on the recruitment of\\n outstanding researchers with leadership abilities. Leadership opportunities are discussed with\\n staff as part of career planning, and are encouraged and supported, through, for example,\\n workload adjustments. Leadership is demonstrated through the active engagement of\\n academics from the School in faculty and University level roles including the Pro-Vice Chancellor\\n for Academic Development (Davies) and supporting faculty Associate Dean roles (Rashid - AD\\n PGR; Race – AD Research; Sas - AD Research Enhancement), which directly influence the\\n ethos, vision and strategy at Faculty and University levels, including the strategy for overall PhD\\n training at Lancaster (Edwards, Director of the Doctoral Academy).\\n Developing careers. Staff development for academics starts with a three-year probation for\\n new Lecturers, which includes rigorous annual reviews. New academic staff in the School\\n receive lighter teaching loads during their probation period. The School research budget,\\n devolved to Groups, is used strategically to support speculative activity (e.g., research visits,\\n pump priming activity). All new academic staff participate in induction sessions, which provide\\n initial information about the resources available including mentorship, KE and pre- and post\\n award professional services support. They also undertake the PG Certificate in Academic\\n Practice (CAP), and a series of associated development and mentoring activities.\\n Through a mix of informal support from mentors and group leads, plus the annual appraisal\\n round, we identify and encourage continual professional development (CPD), including\\n participation in programmes to build leadership and develop careers. These include University\\n courses in coaching, management and leadership, job shadowing and so on. All our research\\n active staff can participate in programmes such as The Balanced Academic and the Resilient\\n Researcher. Diversity, unconscious bias and ‘recruiting the best’ training (for those on\\n recruitment panels) is mandatory to sensitise to possible EDI biases. Staff are encouraged to\\n develop their career even exceptionally by taking additional qualifications, e.g. Executive MBA\\n (Sas, 2018).\\n Our active sabbatical programme enables the School to refresh its research outlook and staff\\n expertise. All staff accrue academic research leave time and may apply to take 1 term in 7 or 1\\n academic year in 7. Cases are considered based on timeliness and strategic importance and a\\n well-developed sabbatical proposal. 19 academics benefitted from sabbaticals this REF period;\\n an investment in staff estimated at around £750K. 13% of sabbaticals prioritised early career\\n staff (unusual as sabbatical entitlement needs to be accrued), with 2 cases last year accelerating\\n cases for female staff who had not previously thought themselves eligible.\\n 2.2 RESEARCHERS AND RESEARCH STUDENTS\\n Researchers. A fundamental part of the school is our postdoctoral researchers (PDRAs) and\\n PhD students, and these are an essential part of the staff pipeline. Both are encouraged to\\n                                                                                                Page 8\\n\\n\\n engage with the wide range of available training opportunities, and informal activities including\\n mentoring, dedicated workshops, our annual PhD conference as well as weekly “brew time”,\\n “brown bag” presentation sessions, and grass roots writing group and maths club activities. PIs\\n and supervisors discuss long term career planning with researchers: this often results in\\n researchers taking on limited teaching or student supervision duties to bolster their CVs. The\\n School’s Graduate Academy provides training on consultancy projects with industry, and helps\\n researchers build networks in the private sector. We also support postdoctoral researchers in\\n developing their own proposals for independent research.\\n Career support for researchers is formalized through an action plan, which is aligned with the\\n Concordat for Early career researchers and includes commitments to the Concordat in Public\\n Engagement in research and the Concordat in research integrity. We aim to provide bridge\\n funding between contracts where possible to avoid unnecessary redundancies and associated\\n contractual uncertainty.\\n Research students. The School has long-standing PhD programmes in Computer Science and\\n in Communication Systems, and leads a CDT (LDSP-MSF, Harper). 33% of our PhD students\\n are from the UK, 16.5% from EU countries and the rest from overseas. During the REF period,\\n we have graduated 141 FTE PhDs, including a cohort of HighWire CDT students joint with\\n Lancaster University’s Institute of Contemporary Arts (LICA) and triple accredited Management\\n School. Our PhD graduate destinations include roles with major multinational companies\\n including Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, academic posts overseas, a wide range of\\n posts in UK academia and industry, and others have created their own start-up businesses (e.g.\\n Hardy & Ellis inventions, developing mixed reality interactive products, finalist in the UK\\n Business Tech Awards 2018, winner of the 2019 European Digital Press Association (EDP)\\n Award; or Vidal working for Focal Smart Glasses for North, in Canada, acquired by Google, June\\n 2020).\\n We recruit internationally, leveraging our world-wide reputation in each of our research areas.\\n We have several formal international partnerships (e.g. Erasmus exchanges with ETH Zürich\\n and LMU Munich) and many other long-standing collaborations through which we attract and\\n exchange students. We have further increased the international impact of our doctoral training\\n through leading and participating in the H2020 Marie Curie Initial Training Network (AffecTech,\\n Sas, €3.8M).\\n We have invested significantly in improving processes and activities for PhD students under the\\n oversight of a new Director of Postgraduate Studies role. This role ensures effective progress\\n monitoring, training and supervision arrangements, assisted by the Research Committee. Our\\n strategy is to create distinctive opportunities based around research groups with opportunities to\\n work across the PhD cohort including seminars, reading and writing groups, informal talks and\\n informal activities. Our goal is to provide a flexible framework that recognises all students are\\n different and encourages and supports where needed without overly restricting those students\\n that need flexibility.\\n Submission deadlines are set at 4 years for full-time students and 7 years for part-time, with rare\\n exceptions for individual circumstances. We treat these deadlines as a shared responsibility and\\n have created a robust support system for students and supervisors including improved progress\\n monitoring and enhanced access to research training. Student monitoring comprises a set of\\n defined checkpoints, commencing with an initial assessment of the student’s skills and\\n knowledge from which training needs can be identified, followed by a series of progress panels\\n until the student is ready to submit. Each PhD student is appraised every 6 months, with clear\\n guidance on what should be included at each point. This offers:\\n      \\uf0b7 Early thesis planning and completion timelines, along with progress checks during the\\n          writing-up period.\\n      \\uf0b7 An appraisal panel of two academic staff, independent from the supervision, and\\n          consistent throughout the PhD, to provide extra support. The first panel member is a\\n          \"subject specialist\", assigned to advise on the specific research topic. The second a\\n          member of the PGR Committee, to provide more general feedback, ensure consistency\\n          and fairness across appraisals in the School, and also feedback issues and concerns via\\n          the PGR committee.\\n                                                                                                Page 9\\n\\n\\n      \\uf0b7   Initiatives aimed at improving the research culture for students included an annual\\n          School PhD conference, new seminar series, better representation, and facilitating\\n          student-led community activities.\\n A wide range of research training courses are provided including in-house ‘masterclasses’,\\n ‘brown bag’ skills talks and Q&A sessions, short courses, and a wide range of further courses\\n coordinated by the Faculty’s Graduate School (now Doctoral Academy led by Edwards).\\n HighWire introduced, and we retained, a taught component on research methods, ethics,\\n interdisciplinary perspectives and critical analysis, which is now compulsory for all students. Our\\n Graduate Academy in SCC offers vocational experience through short-term consultancy projects\\n with industry supported by KE staff.\\n Research students are actively encouraged to attend conferences, summer schools and doctoral\\n colloquia internationally, and we dedicate research training and travel funds to support this. We\\n organise informal opportunities to meet and exchange ideas, including an annual PhD\\n conference which allows all PhD students to showcase their work and get feedback from school\\n colleagues.\\n All of these changes have helped to improve the research environment for PhD students and\\n also to improve on-time completion rates. Since the new support system in 2016/17 we have\\n since seen an improvement in on-time submission of 14% with 14 of 18 submissions on-time in\\n 2019/20. The success of our strategy and the quality of our students is also evident in the\\n successful completion of 141 FTE PhDs in the REF period (our greatest number to date), and\\n awards such as the 2020 Doctoral Dissertation Award by INNS (Gu), 5 EPSRC Doctoral Prizes\\n and highly competitive internships (at Microsoft, Nokia, Google, Amazon, Philips, Alibaba, ARM)\\n and other destinations.\\n 2.3 EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY\\n The School is committed to the advancement of equality throughout all aspects of career\\n development and has procedures for raising and investigating any issues relating to\\n discrimination. We were awarded Athena SWAN Bronze in 2014, which helped us shape our\\n action plan for taking steps to improve gender balance and diversity. This included reviewing the\\n composition of school committees, hiring procedures, and raising awareness and exploring how\\n we can remove barriers experienced by BAME colleagues. Resulting from this in 2015/16, we\\n defined a new 10-Year People Strategy, and Equality, Diversity and Inclusion is core to this. The\\n people strategy realised the need for a new Athena SWAN Director administrative role linked\\n into key internal committees and directed towards an Athena SWAN Silver application in 2021.\\n                 Figure 2: Gender profile by career stage (REF2014 left, REF2021 right)\\n As a result of these initiatives, we advertise widely, and our adverts welcome applications from\\n ‘all diversity groups’, reinforcing our commitment to equal opportunity. Our recruitment materials\\n include a diversity statement and diverse images. Panel chairs undertake ‘unconscious bias’ and\\n ‘recruiting the best training’. This is bearing fruit (Figure 2): we are pleased to see female PDRAs\\n rise from 15% to 21%, female lecturer numbers rise from 13.6% to 17.4%, and we now have 2\\n female professors (13.3%). Professor (Hall) was recruited to strengthen Software Engineering\\n                                                                                                Page 10\\n\\n\\n and is also Deputy Head of School. Sas was promoted in the period, and notably was also the\\n recipient of a Digital Female Leader Award in the Science category in 2019. There is still a long\\n way to go, but we are pleased with this progress.\\n Our EDI champion created the now vibrant Women@Infolab group to provide community\\n building, mentorship and support for female staff and students in the school. This ensures more\\n effective communication of particular gender related issues and experiences. For instance,\\n resulting from a grass roots initiative, we will be hosting the BCS Lovelace colloquium next year.\\n We have a significant body of early career staff (23 at grades 7/8, 20 under age 40) and have\\n been pleased to support requests for maternity and paternity leave, and adjustments to working\\n hours on childcare related grounds (12 paternity and 5 shared paternity leaves were approved\\n during the REF period). We encourage use of MARS (maternity/adoption research support)\\n funding which provides small grants to sustain research and career progression during periods\\n of parental leave (2 cases so far).\\n Our school comprises staff from a range of ethnic backgrounds (29% BAME). We have been\\n pleased to be able to progress many of our staff in the period, leading to an increase in BAME\\n staff at more senior levels: Senior Lecturer (38.5% from 17.6%) and Professor (26.7% from\\n 23%), Figure 3. We have maintained our proportion of staff with a declared disability (4% of\\n staff, 5% in 2014).\\n              Figure 3: Ethnicity profile by career stage (REF2014 left, REF2021 right)\\n Our diversity is further strengthened by our active Visitors Programme. 116 researchers from 26\\n different countries have held visiting positions with the school since 2014, enabling new\\n collaborations and sharing of knowledge worldwide.\\n 2.4 WELLBEING & MENTAL HEALTH\\n Supporting our staff and students’ wellbeing is a growing focus and in 2017 the school created\\n wellbeing officer roles for both students and staff, who now undertake specific training and\\n responsibility as clear point of contact and gateway to professional support where needed.\\n As part of our commitment to the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers\\n we provide all staff with access to confidential professional support through the Employee\\n Assistance Programme and implement the Five Ways to Wellbeing framework, used by the\\n Government, the NHS and charities like Mind.\\n To continue to progress this important area, the school has recently formed a\\n Staff Wellbeing Engagement group, which has been linked through the Institution’s Safety,\\n Health & Wellbeing (SHaW) committee structure, to ensure that as this provision grows, the\\n Institute wide support options and wellbeing resources are made increasingly available.\\n                                                                                             Page 11\\n\\n\\n 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n   Key highlights\\n        \\uf0b7 Sustained growth of research income from £18.8M to £28.5M (51%) over three times\\n            the rate of growth of staff FTE (14.3%)\\n        \\uf0b7 Strategic investment in infrastructure via institutes and centres to strengthen\\n            interdisciplinarity research\\n        \\uf0b7 Increase in number of academic staff winning at least one project as a PI (73%)\\n        \\uf0b7 Supported >£5M of major fellowships at both senior and junior levels\\n 3.1 RESEARCH PORTFOLIO\\n One of our strategic priorities has been to grow research income and income per head, with a\\n particular emphasis on increasing the number of active PIs, targeting of larger awards and\\n diversifying our range of funding sources. This has been successful: research income has gone\\n from £18.8M to £28.5M, a 51% growth – more than twice the growth rate of staff FTE. The total\\n amount of grant funding awarded during the REF2021 period is £39.4M. This growth included\\n diversification of our research portfolio and has followed the targeting of new strategic areas\\n such as Data Science and Digital Health. Evidencing this, we highlight:\\n      \\uf0b7   Large Awards, e.g. EPSRC funded Senior Fellowship (G. Blair, £2.5M) acting as a\\n          springboard for further awards in a new area of environmental data science; EC\\n          funded AffecTech (Sas, €3.8M) resulting in multiple award winning publications; the\\n          Next Generation Converged Digital Infrastructure project (Race, £2M, £0.9M from\\n          EPSRC and £1.1M from BT), instrumental for B4RN impact case study; Towards\\n          Ultimate Convergence of All Networks, TOUCAN (Hutchison, £1.2M); Leverhulme\\n          Trust funded Doctoral Scholarship programme in Material Social Futures (Harper,\\n          £1.4M); and, H-unique ERC (co-I, Angelov, £1.6M) focusing on tackling image based\\n          online crime, and widely publicised in the media.\\n      \\uf0b7   Increasing PIs: As a result of our mentoring, support and management programmes all\\n          academic staff actively apply for research grants, with ~73% of academic staff winning at\\n          least one project as a PI.\\n      \\uf0b7   Sustainability of funding: In REF2014 SCC were the top UK UoA recipient of EU\\n          funding. We have successfully diversified our research funding, increasing the share of\\n          UKRI awards (from 38% in REF2014 to over 54%). We also draw upon UK Government\\n          and charity funding increased from 6.7% to over 22.5% (Figure 4). Direct industry funding\\n          has increased 47% since 2014 to 9.5%.\\n                                       Funding sources structure\\n                           60.00%\\n                           50.00%\\n                           40.00%\\n                           30.00%\\n                           20.00%\\n                           10.00%\\n                            0.00%\\n                                      UKRI         EU         UK      Industry\\n                                                         Government\\n                                              REF 2014  REF 2021\\n                           Figure 4: Funding by source (REF2021 vs REF2014)\\n Our growth in research income has provided a solid basis for strengthening our core strategic\\n pillars:\\n                                                                                              Page 12\\n\\n\\n Interdisciplinary research. Our portfolio mix reflects our strengths in interdisciplinary research\\n including in data science, security and health. Some examples: Gellersen attracted £0.9M of\\n interdisciplinary funding for EPSRC funded Monitoring Dementia with eye movements; Sas has\\n secured £0.8M for work on personal technologies for affective health; Angelov is leading the\\n school’s £1.6M part of the H-unique ERC project which brings together deep learning, image\\n processing, biometrics and forensics to revolutionise identification of criminals from hands in\\n online images; Helal is leading NHS funding of £0.8M for the Connected Health Cities.\\n Our pro-active role in the interdisciplinary Institutes and Centres has been central to increased\\n research funding success:\\n      \\uf0b7    The Data Science Institute - DSI (co-Director: Davies) was founded in 2014 building on\\n           Lancaster’s historic strengths in Computer Science, Statistics and Operational Research.\\n           It has grown to become one of Europe’s strongest and most diverse single-institution\\n           data science communities of over 118 staff and 193 researchers. DSI embraces data-\\n           driven challenges across disciplines including the environmental sciences, health and\\n           medicine, epidemiology and population health, humanities, sociology and creative arts.\\n           Over 5 years, DSI has applied for £128M in grants, securing £23M to Lancaster (£46M to\\n           partners); launched our most successful MSc programme; and secured over 200 industry\\n           placements yielding over £500K additional funding from companies, e.g. Amazon, eBay,\\n           PwC, EY, Santander.\\n      \\uf0b7    Security Lancaster – SL (Suri – co-Director; Race and Prince, Associate Directors) draws\\n           together 47 academic staff from all faculties and includes Psychology, Physics,\\n           Management, Health & Medicine and Politics, Philosophy & Religion. It creatively\\n           challenges the way that individuals, organisations and societies secure and protect\\n           themselves with a holistic understanding of security risks from a socio-technical\\n           perspective. SL has been instrumental in broadening SCC’s research base, allowing\\n           access to both EPSRC and ESRC funds as well as sources that SCC has not historically\\n           accessed such as the Home Office, MoD and US DoD. We were approved to host one of\\n           8 (now 19) GCHQ Accredited Centres of Excellence in Cyber-Security. SL is home to\\n           national/EU research centres and industry accelerators, collectively worth over £20M. SL\\n           secured £2.8M in grants, as well as the Greater Manchester and Lancashire Cyber\\n           Foundries promoting cyber-security in regional businesses, and latterly the Secure\\n           University Enterprise Zone (UEZ). More recently, SL led a successful £3M Security Node\\n           on Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS-S) funding (PI: Suri, co-Is: Angelov,\\n           Hutchison, Giotsas).\\n      \\uf0b7    The Institute for Social Futures - ISF (co-Director: Harper) brings leading social science\\n           and humanities research together with computer, engineering and medical science to\\n           develop thinking, visioning, analysis and data relating to the futures we want and need.\\n           Harper was a strategic appointment from Microsoft research and is a social scientist by\\n           background. ISF has brought in £6.8M; co-leads the £1.5M Leverhulme Doctoral\\n           Scholarships programme in Material Social Futures with the Materials Institute\\n           (Chemistry, Physics and Engineering) delivering 21 new PhDs over 5 years with specific\\n           training to better engage with boards, government, regulators and policymakers around\\n           socially contextualised material innovations.\\n Structured for research excellence. By leveraging research groups, institutes and centres, we\\n have created more opportunities to build collaborative and cross-department teams to prepare\\n for research bids resulting in research income growth. The informal mentorship and intellectual\\n life of the Centres and Institutes has been particularly beneficial for early career staff in terms of\\n effective career development. This has led to the securing of major grants and fellowships, e.g.\\n ERC Starting Fellowship (£1.5M, Alexander), EPSRC Early Career Fellowship (£1M,\\n Garraghan), and the Leverhulme Fellowship (£253K, Porter), to date instrumental in promotion\\n cases for Alexander - Professor; Porter - Senior Lecturer.\\n Maximising Impact. Our impact strategy of embedding KE staff within the School, choosing co-\\n located companies based on their synergy with our research, and embedding and supporting\\n impact plans into research projects has resulted in broadened collaboration with UK and global\\n                                                                                                  Page 13\\n\\n\\n  industry. Examples include projects with major partners such as BT (Race), ARM (Wang) and\\n  Raytheon (Nagaraja), but also a wide variety of SMEs such as In Touch Ltd, DemoPad Software\\n  Ltd, and Quantum Base Ltd. Many of these connections were brokered initially by KE staff.\\n  We have maintained strong connections with international companies securing funding from\\n  Ford (Angelov), Airbus (Hutchinson), Sony (Gellersen), Microsoft (Finney) and Huawei (Jiang)\\n  among others. These projects are instrumental for wider impact, allowing us to leverage\\n  research council funding by using industry funding to take research outcomes closer to market.\\n  An example of this is the Microsoft-funded project led by Finney which was critically important for\\n  the micro:bit initiative (one of our impact case studies). Micro:bit exemplifies the broader, social\\n  and educational impact of our research that reached millions of young children in over 50\\n  countries3.\\n  Another of our impact case studies, B4RN, also highlights our testbed and stakeholder engaged\\n  approach to research, in terms of social as well as technical implications. For example, this\\n  culminated in April 2020 in a partnership between B4RN and Zykel Communications that bought\\n  ultra-fast broadband to 21 primary schools in the North of England enabling them to make use of\\n  the latest education technology and software, whilst teachers and students complete work\\n  online, attend virtual events, seminars and workshops, and make use of cloud-based resources\\n  for the first time. This was invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Commenting on the B4RN\\n  connection, a clinical lead for intensive care stated. ‘It has allowed us to work at home when\\n  appropriate but still maintain good quality work and information from patient records and\\n  particularly scans (which are data heavy) as well as […] ensuring the best clinical advice […] It\\n  has been so important to us that we had access to the most up to date publications and\\n  research […] online and with fast, reliable access.’\\n  3.2 INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITIES\\n  Strategic investment. The foundation of the Institutes has triggered major strategic investments\\n  in staff, estate and infrastructure:\\n       \\uf0b7   The University has funded the DSI administrative staff and appointment of 17 new\\n           academic staff including four 50th Anniversary Lecturers and underwriting 0.5FTE of an\\n           SCC co-director (Davies).

Our involvement led\\n           by Finney (Director at Lancaster), Prince and Friday attracted £581K funding to the\\n           School, allowing us to offer new studio led teaching facilities enabling a new more\\n           diverse and inclusive minor curriculum for non-Computing majors (L. Blair, curriculum\\n           lead at Lancaster).\\n       \\uf0b7 The Wolfson Secure Data Science Infrastructure (SDSI) is co-funded by the Wolfson\\n           Foundation and Lancaster University (£1.5M) and scheduled to open in 2021. The SDSI\\n           will offer the ability to handle data at a range of government classification levels, enabling\\n           research including highly sensitive health, IP sensitive or classified information with\\n           appropriate levels of assurance. This will be a unique HEI-based facility in the North\\n           West.\\n       \\uf0b7 Lancaster is part of the recently announced Research England Secure Digitalisation\\n           Enterprize Zone (SecureD UEZ), which will drive economic growth, create jobs and help\\n           businesses develop innovative new products and services.

The intentional co-location of businesses and our KE team\\n within the School fosters formal and informal networking and adds significant value to the\\n companies and researchers working together in InfoLab21. Collaboration is fostered via a mix of\\n targeted recruitment and a structured resident company support scheme, where companies\\n entering the facility are required to have a research collaboration plan in place with a named\\n SCC academic sponsor. This structured process has ensured three recent KTPs and directly\\n enabled one of our four Impact Case Studies. During the REF period, co-located companies\\n have hosted over 30 SCC student internships and extra-curricular projects and over 25 projects\\n via other departments at the institution. KE Staff are involved throughout the school’s grant\\n development processes: identifying partners; collaboration opportunities and co-creation of\\n impact pathways. KE staff provide guidance on commercialisation, intellectual property rights\\n and contract negotiation, which is particularly valuable for ECRs when starting out.\\n The School’s Graduate Academy team of 15 staff run a £7.6M portfolio of engagement projects\\n employing analyst developers and utilising paid SCC student placements to support over 200\\n small businesses in Cumbria, Lancashire and Greater Manchester in generating new products\\n and services to evolve and differentiate their businesses. Project staff both re-skill and gain\\n vocational experience whilst also helping regional businesses prosper. At the start of the REF\\n period, the InfoLab21 Strategic Innovation and Support Programme closed having assisted 365\\n companies. The project was the Government’s national pilot in ‘Transformational ICT’ for\\n business and its success went on to embed the Graduate Academy model in a number of\\n projects, including in Lancaster and in Greater Manchester (GM) as part of the GM Cyber\\n Foundry Project.\\n                                                                                              Page 15\\n\\n\\n  4.

This is\\n  exemplified by the release of Wmatrix44 corpus analysis and comparison tool (Rayson), version\\n  4 released in December 2018, and a number of public corpus linguistics datasets5. Wmatrix4\\n  has 6,828 academic users around the globe and was licenced by successful spin-out Relative\\n  Insight to underpin their advertising platform (see impact case study).\\n  Contributing to an open and exciting environment for our researchers, we regularly host\\n  research visitors including extended stays from senior academics worldwide on sabbatical leave\\n  (e.g. from the USA, Australia, Brazil, EU), researchers seconded from collaborating institutions\\n  as well as visiting PhD students for a “sandwich” year, e.g. from Spain, Brazil, Slovenia and\\n  others. As an evidence of our strong international collaboration and the value of these\\n  international collaborations more than half (53.35%) of our submitted outputs are co-authored\\n  internationally.\\n  4.2 ACADEMIC LEADERSHIP AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE RESEARCH BASE\\n  We contribute substantially to research community activities and leadership and our academics\\n  hold a variety of notable positions.

School academics were\\n actively involved in International Programme and/or Technical Committees Chairing roles. We\\n encourage junior staff to participate in these activities as part of their career development. Some\\n representative examples include:\\n     \\uf0b7   International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN, 2016, 2019; IEEE\\n         International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, FUZZ-IEEE, 2014, 2018; IEEE International\\n         Conference on Intelligent Systems, 2014, 2016, 2020 (Angelov)\\n     \\uf0b7   IEEE/ACM International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems, 2015 (Suri)\\n     \\uf0b7   ACM SIGHI Conference on Designing Interactive Systems, DIS, 2014, 2016, 2019; 2020\\n         ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, 2014, 2016, 2018,\\n         2019, 2020 (Sas; 2019-2020, Knowles)\\n     \\uf0b7   10th IEEE Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing, 2017 (Ni)\\n     \\uf0b7   ACM Conference on Ubiquitous Computing, UbiComp, 2015; ACM Mobile HCI, 2015\\n         (Gellersen)\\n     \\uf0b7   IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2014 (Navaie)\\n     \\uf0b7   IEEE XP Conference on Agile Software Development, 2016 (Hall)\\n Other exemplars of specific esteem and leadership include: Queen’s Anniversary Prize (Rayson,\\n 2015); IEEE Golden Code recognition (Helal, 2018); IEEE Outstanding Contributions award\\n (Angelov, 2017), Santander Chair of Excellence, University Carlos III, Madrid (Angelov, 2016),\\n Steering group member Royal Society Digital Technology and the Planet (Friday).\\n 4.3 ECONOMY: COLLABORATION WITH INDUSTRY AND USER COMMUNITIES\\n Collaboration with industry continues to be a key part of our research and impact strategy. The\\n majority of our grants are from research councils with in-kind contribution from industry or from\\n industry direct funding or InnovateUK. The number of research projects directly funded by\\n industrial partners has grown from 36 to 74 during this REF period, with a diverse set of national\\n and international companies such as BT, ARM, Google, Raytheon UK, Ford, Airbus, Sony,\\n Microsoft and Huawei working with us. The close engagement with our research users is pivotal\\n for understanding and impact on vital real-life issues. We often involve user groups from the very\\n                                                                                               Page 17\\n\\n\\n beginning of our research development, even before a specific project proposal is conceived, to\\n identify problems, requirements, reservations and aspirations to inform the research approach.\\n Engaging stakeholders in our work is critical. Our approach is to integrate the academic and\\n business communities enabling socially, environmentally and economically impactful research.\\n Our KE staff led to generation of £10.5M of the schools’ £28.5M grant income from partners; an\\n average contribution of £1.75Mpa; supported over 60 guest lectures; put 82 MSc students into\\n industrial experience placements; created 50 other industry internships and engaged with over\\n 200 SMEs. Over the same period our co-location facility housed 21 companies, where all\\n resident companies collaborate with academic researchers. This co-location and support directly\\n lead to KTPs focusing on novel security frameworks with Upside Energy (Marneredes);\\n managing flood risk with JBA (Blair); and threat intelligence with Mitigate Cyber (Prince) – plus\\n the foundation of the Greater Manchester and Lancashire cyber-foundry projects, spearheading\\n the translation of cyber-security research into regional companies and beyond.\\n 4.4 SOCIETY: IMPACT, COMMUNICATION AND OUTREACH\\n Much of our research is done in partnership with community stakeholders or with wider societal\\n impact in mind. This is illustrated by the following subset of our activities:\\n         Our long running engagement with the BBC, led to our pivotal engagement with micro:bit,\\n         as described in one of our impact case studies. Micro:bit is a pocket-sized computer with\\n         a very low barrier to entry that has been given to every 11/12 year old child in year 7 or\\n         equivalent across the UK, for free. Lancaster, as the only academic partner in the\\n         industrial consortium, led the device software component (Finney) and engaging through\\n         the programme with 29 partners including Amazon, ARM, Microsoft, Samsung, Barclays,\\n         and IET. While the micro:bit programme is important in terms of industrial collaboration\\n         and commercialisation, the most important impacts of this project are societal and\\n         educational. By engaging early with school age children, we are bringing the next\\n         generation of software experts ‘into the fold’ and hopefully helping stimulate a software\\n         boom similar to that seeded by the original BBC micro in the 1980s. Our involvement in\\n         the development of the BBC micro:bit was covered in 146 media publications/digital\\n         articles including major domestic titles such as the BBC, Yahoo, International Business\\n         Times, Electronic Weekly, Computer Weekly, Tech Radar, IT Pro, and Reuters reaching\\n         an audience of more than 14M. It also received international media attention, including\\n         outlets in Germany and India.\\n         The H-unique hand-identification project is pioneering deep learning in identification of\\n         criminals by the image of their hand. If successful, this project will open the door to\\n         prosecuting dangerous sexual predators from the materials they post online, something\\n         that is extremely challenging to do using current methods. This work has been covered\\n         by 180 media publications/digital articles including the BBC, Daily Mail, Independent,\\n         Daily Telegraph, Daily Mirror and many local/regional newspapers across the UK,\\n         reaching around 8.5M readers. This research was also the subject of a special BBC\\n         Radio 4 documentary called ‘The Hand Detectives’ and was discussed on BBC Radio 4\\n         Today programme, the BBC World Service, BBC News Channel (TV), BBC2, BBC 5Live,\\n         BBC 6 Music, and BBC Scotland. The research was highlighted on CBC – the Canadian\\n         national radio broadcaster as well as on 22 different BBC regional radio stations. The\\n         total broadcast reach was in excess of 10.9M.\\n         Computing at School Regional Centre. Leading the regional Computing at School\\n         Northwest Regional Centres (L. Blair, Director), worked to train regional teachers to\\n         promote good Computer Science teaching practice. During this period, we worked with\\n         over 1,000 teachers and delivered 4,200 CPD learning hours of training. In addition, we\\n         ran annual ‘Girls in Computing’ workshops for 50-60 primary age children; ran a creative\\n         A-level workshop for 3 schools on a micro:bit-based Smart City exploring IoT and\\n         privacy; an Isaac Computing Discovery Day for 90 15 to 18 year olds in conjunction with\\n         the National Centre for Computing Education; and annually run Taster Days, STEM\\n         challenge days, Summer Schools and Visit Day activities. This quote represents the\\n         significant impact this work has had on teaching professionals at a more personal level:\\n                                                                                                Page 18\\n\\n\\n          “The coordinators were invaluable to me at a time when I did not see a future for myself\\n          in a profession that I had been in for over 10 years. Following that meeting and the\\n          courses that they provide I have gone on to find a passion for the subject, which I never\\n          thought I would be able to do [...] which has now led to me being a master teacher and\\n          hub leader.”\\n We identified a need to better communicate with non-technical stakeholders in our previous REF\\n period and have been working to better promote and explain our research, and its value, to the\\n community at large. A number of our staff are now regularly consulted by members of the press,\\n leading to radio and TV appearances. We are proactive in identifying and communicating the\\n stories of our research with support from the University’s Press Office. We communicate\\n frequently to audiences across the globe via a range of TV, radio, and print media including\\n national newspapers such as the Sunday Times, the BBC News website as well as its flagship\\n technology programme Click, Reuters, Wired, and The Economist.\\n Examples include:\\n     \\uf0b7    Institute of Coding was covered in 16 media publications/digital articles including SC\\n          Magazine, Insider Media, Times Higher Education, Prolific North, and Gov.uk reaching\\n          an audience of more than 1.6M. Our academics often give interviews on national radio\\n          such as BBC Radio 5 Live (audience 2M), BBC Radio 4 (audience 3.3M), BBC Radio 2\\n          (audience 4.5M).\\n     \\uf0b7    Further exemplars of SCC staff in the media, include comments on the HSBC biometric\\n          security (Prince, 2016); Digital memories (Sas, 2016), Dark Web (Prince, 2016),\\n          Streaming and energy usage (Hazas, 2018), (Hazas, Giotsas and Widdicks, 2019),\\n          Smart wearable technology that detects emotions (Sas, 2019), (Gellersen and Clarke,\\n          2017), Data centres’ energy use (Garraghan, 2020). We gave interviews on different TV\\n          channels or on hot topics, including BBC (Prince, 2015; Rashid, 2017; Clarke, 2017; Suri,\\n          2019, 2020), Sky (Markarian, 2016 and Rashid, 2017, Prince, 2018 twice, 2020), ITV\\n          (Rashid, 2017), TRT (Rashid, 2017), Reuters (Karnik, 2016) and CNN (Suri, 2020).\\n Our work has had a wide range of research, economic and societal benefits. We were pleased\\n to have supported a promotion case to Professor with significant societal impact (Finney). We\\n are now helping define University promotions criteria for engagement and teaching promotions\\n pathways in addition to the more traditional research and balanced criteria. We are confident\\n that this potential for recognition will enable research with impact to continue across the school\\n and the institution more broadly.\\n                                                                                               Page 19\\n  ', 'b_env']\n",

Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n1.i) Research Structures\\nComputer Science (CS) is central to modern societal challenges, and UoA11 activity stretches\\nacross the University. Connections are facilitated by the institutional Digital Futures Platform, a\\nnetwork of over 1000 researchers across 30 disciplines. The Department of Computer Science is\\nat the core, delivering the fundamental CS that underpins University capabilities: housing 54/58 Unit\\nstaff, with 4 in the Medical School. In the REF period, income per FTE increased 79%, and Unit staff\\npublished over 1200 peer-reviewed outputs; partnered with 46 UK universities, and 660 EU\\norganisations (e.g. contributing leadership in the EC FET Flagship Human Brain Project) and\\nreceived 14 competitive fellowships, including an RAEng 10-year Chair, a RS Wolfson Research\\nMerit Award, and a UK Parliamentary Fellowship.\\nThe Department is part of the wider School of Engineering – connecting us to a breadth of expertise\\nfrom electronics to materials, and reflecting our commitment to CS as an engineering discipline.\\nFaculty, School and Unit strategies work synergistically to support research and its impact, providing\\neconomies of scale and barrier-free interactions. We pursue 6 themes: Data Science, Artificial\\nIntelligence, Human-Centred Computing, Theory & Foundations, Software & e-Infrastructure,\\nand Future Computing – each with an assigned academic lead – with cross-theme support from a\\nDirector of Research, Impact Lead, Outputs Champion, and Director of Business Engagement. Each\\nof our academics self-identifies as a member of (at least) one of 9 research groups, which comprise\\nthe expertise to pursue our themes: Advanced Processor Technologies, Autonomy & Verification,\\nFormal Methods, Human Computer Systems, Imaging Science, Information Management, Machine\\nLearning & Robotics, Nano-Engineering & Spintronics, and Natural Language Processing & Text\\nMining. The themes provide breadth, while groups provide depth, supporting subject-specific\\nnurturing of talent.\\nTo bridge disciplines, we support joint appointments (currently 11), channelling impact across\\nboundaries. Data Science/A.I.: 4 staff (imaging science) are joint with the Medical School; and 4 joint\\nwith the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology.

The Unit spent GBP5,500,000 (see 2.viii) to support 178 PGRs\\n    unrestricted in topic, fuelling either outward-looking or pioneering research\\n\\uf0b7   encouraging models of collaborative research: We promoted a range of collaboration through\\n    pursuit of diverse funding: e.g. UKRI (104 projects overall including 4 programme grants), EU\\n    (52 projects); KTPs (12); and CASE/iCASE studentships (14).\\n\\uf0b7   engaging with our industry club: Our Industry Club has 200+ organisations (double 2014).\\n    This provides PGR recruitment pathways, and new research (e.g. we initiated a 5-year BBC Data\\n    Science Partnership, raising challenges in ethics, data science, and psychology).\\n\\uf0b7   supporting sabbaticals and extended visits: Our flexible processes (2.iv) mean we regularly\\n    achieve our target of 10% of academics on sabbatical: many industry or public sector, e.g. one\\n    impact case builds on a sabbatical at NASA.\\n\\uf0b7   encouraging different forms of dissemination: Our research was profiled at high-profile\\n    events (e.g. BlueDot 2018-19), TV, media and local events (4.iv).\\nTo ensure critical mass covering both directions around the circle, we invested to link our themes:\\n\\uf0b7   Data Science/A.I.: Following a worldwide talent search, Kaski took up a “President’s Chair in\\n    A.I.”, and a role as Research Director for the UoM Christabel Pankhurst Institute for Health\\n    Technologies. This is a prime example of the virtuous circle – Kaski, well-known for\\n    fundamental ML, now leads research in an institute with focus on applications.\\n\\uf0b7   A.I./Human Computing/Theory & Foundations: We built cross-theme bridges by hiring\\n    Cangelosi in cognitive robotics, and Fisher/Dixon/Dennis in verification of robotic systems. This\\n    includes a RAEng 10-year Emerging Technologies Chair (Fisher), developing automated\\n    reasoning theory (pioneering) applied to responsible autonomous systems (outward-looking).\\n\\uf0b7   Theory & Foundations/Future Computing: Building links to the UoM Digital Trust & Security\\n    Initiative, we recruited to grow cyber-security: in pioneering theory (Lammich) and outward-\\n    looking applications in UAV firmware security (Cordeiro), and secure networks (Mustafa).\\n\\uf0b7   Future Computing/A.I.: 5 new academics including Petoumenos, using Deep Learning for\\n    compiler analysis (pioneering); and Rhodes, developing computational neuroscience models\\n    on our ground-breaking SpiNNaker machine (outward-looking).\\n\\uf0b7   Human Computing/Software & e-Infrastructures/Future Computing: “People-Data-Chips”\\n    was an integrative initiative in ubiquitous computing, hiring Kotselidis/Clinch/Freitas. Kotselidis is\\n    now 0.5FTE industry (3.v), and Freitas is 0.5FTE with the UoM Cancer Research institute, both\\n    closing the virtuous circle again.\\nThese actions enabled significant outputs, where the virtuous circle is evident.\\nAs examples of pioneering ideas within the discipline: In our A.I. theme, Kaski contributed a\\nnew Deep Learning paradigm for differential flows that learn stochastic differential equations. In\\nFuture Computing, Koch developed the first method to detect malicious FPGA configurations by\\ndirectly investigating binaries – the security patches adopted by Amazon Web Services. In Theory\\n& Foundations, Cordeiro developed the first algorithms to verify multi-threaded software using\\nshared-memory synchronization, identifying previously unknown vulnerabilities in Intel firmware.\\nVoronkov/Reger made major advances in first-order logic theorem proving, implemented in the\\naward-winning Vampire theorem prover - established as the world’s most powerful (with CASC/SMT\\ncompetition victories and industrial deployment) theorem prover for first-order logic – with\\nimplications for adjoining areas such as verification and program analysis.\\n                                                                                                 Page 2\\n\\n\\nAs examples of outward-looking research: In Future Computing, Rhodes/Furber demonstrated\\nthe world’s first real-time simulation of a cortical microcircuit with over 300 million synapses, utilising\\nour million-core SpiNNaker neuromorphic machine. Bridging our Future Computing/Theory &\\nFoundations themes, Korovin developed the world’s first implementation of a non-deterministic\\nTuring Machine using DNA, confirmed with in-vitro molecular biology. In A.I., Cootes/Lindner\\ntransformed the challenge of shape model-matching in medical images – the methodologies were\\ncommercialised and form an impact case, focusing on bone fracture assessment. In Human\\nCentred Computing, Jay developed ECG visualisations for diagnosis of life-threatening conditions\\nby non-specialists: subsequently shortlisted for the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee’s STEM\\nfor Britain Awards.\\nWhat we learnt: The “virtuous circle” works well as a high-level strategy. However, a finer-grained\\napproach is necessary to have continued meaningful influence on our environment. In the period,\\nour strategy has evolved with time, maintaining the “circle”, but expanding its influence.\\nIn the REF2021 period, our major policies/initiatives/actions can be summarised as following a set\\nof guiding principles, which also form the basis for our future strategy. These articulate our vision\\nfor what it means to be a world-class environment, and are intentionally light-touch, and “people-\\nfocused”. These align with University priorities (e.g. parity of support/esteem between research\\ndiscovery/application, see REF5a 2.iv). Throughout this document, we highlight (where not self-\\nexplanatory) how the Principles were implemented.\\nPrinciple 1: Critical Mass & Complementarity. Ensuring we have an appropriate spread of\\nintellectual capital to solve hard CS problems, tackle interdisciplinary grand challenges, and grow\\nfuture leaders for both. For example: our recruitment strategy (2.i) targets individuals to naturally\\ninterface with colleagues across the new UoM Engineering structure (REF5a).\\nPrinciple 2: Empowerment & Support. Ensuring our researchers feel trusted, with the weight of\\nthe University behind them, with the time/motivation to take our Unit in new directions. For example:\\nour duties assignment process supports short-notice secondments; the approval process for PGR\\ntraining funds (2.x) encourages autonomy (empowerment), whilst mentoring/training (2.iii) provides\\nessential ECR support.\\nPrinciple 3: Ambition & Curiosity. Ensuring we tackle ambitious real-world and interdisciplinary\\nchallenges, targeting “quality over quantity”, whilst also valuing curiosity-driven research with no\\nshort-term application. For example: we have increased interdisciplinary PGR activity, and promoted\\nthe “quality-over-quantity” agenda for all, with emphasis for ECRs as they launch careers.\\nPrinciple 4: Responsibility. Ensuring our environment fosters open research and reproducibility,\\nand is committed to equality, diversity, and inclusion. We have (i) engaged in leadership of the open\\nresearch agenda; (ii) monitored/maintained EDIA as a key element of hiring policy, taking affirmative\\naction where necessary; and (iii) continued to promote open research to all staff.\\nThe Next Five Years\\nThe Principles form a framework for future strategy. In the current period, we have made strong\\nprogress, though we see further areas to address for each.\\nIn Principle 1, we will continue to support our current investments: robotics and formal verification;\\ndata science for healthcare, and hardware/software security, whilst strengthening capabilities in the\\nfundamentals of A.I. via a new pan-University centre exploiting the appointment of Kaski. In\\nPrinciple 2, we will increase ECR involvement in leadership roles, within/beyond the department. In\\nPrinciple 3, we will exploit the new UoM Engineering structures, increasing engagement in cross-\\ndisciplinary challenges. In Principle 4, we will pro-actively seek to recruit individuals with “non-\\ntraditional” career paths, bringing a diversity of perspectives to the environment.\\n                                                                                                  Page 3\\n\\n\\n1.iii) Fostering Impact\\nOur strategy is founded on collaboration (exemplars in Section 4) and the institutional infrastructure\\nfor business engagement (3.ii). We support, enable, and incentivise our researchers in as broad a\\nrange of impact as possible, letting the talent speak for itself – the following actions implement\\nStrategy Principle 2 (Empowerment/Support) and 3 (Ambition).\\nSupport:\\n         Shortening Pathways to Impact: The UoM company “Innovation Factory” (IF) accelerates\\n         all IP opportunities: e.g. legal issues, and Click2Go, a web-platform for licensing software.\\n         The Manchester Enterprise Centre develops/supports entrepreneurship via events/courses.\\n         Outcomes: IF assisted in founding 3 Unit spinouts (ExGence, Eurimatics, Data Value\\n         Factory); and Click2Go deployed the BoneFinder software (see impact case).\\n         Faculty Impact Officers and Business Engagement Teams: The Faculty retains 3 full-\\n         time Impact Officers whose duties include liaison between industry/academics at the point of\\n         exploitation. The Business Engagement team (3.ii, also REF5a 4.1), provides opportunities,\\n         via regular events and connections to major organisations.\\n         Strong support for EPSRC IAAs/KTPs as a catalyst for long-term activity, supported by a\\n         dedicated Knowledge Exchange team (5FTE) at Faculty level. Outcome: We held 29 IAAs\\n         (GBP851,359) and 12 KTPs (100% success rate, total GBP2,610,767, e.g., cross-\\n         disciplinary KTP with Bott&Co. Solicitors).\\nEnablers:\\n         Fostering partnerships: We have long-term partnerships (e.g. ARM, BBC, BAE Systems,\\n         AstraZeneca, Pfizer), via one-to-one contacts, and our wider Industry Club activities (e.g.\\n         invitations to the PGR Symposium provides opportunities). For academics, this affords\\n         collaboration, and for PDRAs/PGRs, a pathway to impactful careers. Outcomes: In the\\n         period, 20% of visitors were industry-based, and our club grew from 50 to 200+ members.\\n         Releasing time via workload adjustments: We award 0.1FTE reduction for fostering a\\n         recognised potential REF impact case, and ad-hoc adjustments for any (non-REF) impact\\n         activity. Sabbaticals can be used for impact (2.iv). Outcomes: Embury took two semesters\\n         (2018-19) to build relations with ARM, returning with an ARM/RAEng Industrial Fellowship.\\n         Providing people & bridging funding: The Faculty funds PDRA “Impact Fellowships”\\n         (currently 18, 6-24 months). UoM employs a baseline-funded team of Research Software\\n         Engineers (3.ii). Strategic funds are available from Unit or central sources, to bridge PDRAs\\n         on flagship projects between contracts. Outcomes: One Fellow supports a potential impact\\n         case on virtual reality for amputee rehabilitation. The Unit provided bridging funding for a\\n         REF2021 impact case (SpiNNaker), supporting the long-term ambition in the project.\\n         Enabling PGRs to play a role: Impact and public engagement are part of PGR training (2.x),\\n         and PGR internships are encouraged. Outcomes: PGR Seaton (2015, supervisor Lujan)\\n         interned at Oracle, with results built into a product, GraalVM. PGRs also engaged via the IAA\\n         account, e.g. Del-Pinto worked at SNOMED International, implementing sub-ontology\\n         generation, with the outcome built into the company’s strategic roadmap.\\nIncentives: Impact is an explicit factor in promotions (2.ii), and recognition/reward structures (2.vi),\\nwhilst a culture of supporting the parity of esteem for impact/fundamentals is embedded in all\\ndepartmental communications.\\n                                                                                                 Page 4\\n\\n\\nFuture vitality is supported by growing our ability to influence industrially-relevant funding\\nprogrammes (e.g. Goodacre is Challenge Director for UKRI’s GBP75,000,000 ISCF “Digital Security\\nby Design”); and attracting researchers with interests in impact, e.g. our staffing strategy (2.i)\\nexplicitly pursues part-time appointments. Future sustainability is supported by: (i) duty roles for\\nimpact, e.g. public engagement (Reger/Cordeiro, each 0.1FTE); and Impact Champion (Embury\\n0.15FTE). (ii) supporting staff contributions in all areas (REF-eligible or not, see 4.iii); (iii) leadership,\\ne.g. Jay in the UKRI Software Sustainability Institute (1.vi).\\nLinking Strategies to Impact Cases:\\n -    Biorelate: A programme of research on contextual text-mining (led by Nenadic) was\\n      commercialized by a PGR, aided by a GBP10,000 grant from the Manchester Enterprise centre,\\n      and Nenadic’s pre-existing partnership with Pfizer.\\n -    SpiNNaker: Original funding (EPSRC) was bridged to the EU funding via GBP250,000 UoM\\n      internal impact funding, retaining key PDRAs as they constructed the million-core machine. A\\n      sabbatical (2016) for Furber gave time to build up demonstrators for the machine, and\\n      SpiNNaker workshops were entirely coordinated by PGRs/PDRAs.\\n -    NASA spacecraft: Barringer (retired) was introduced to a problem in runtime verification of\\n      spacecraft command sequences while on sabbatical at NASA. Barringer/NASA co-created a\\n      solution, used in space missions that continue to date. Reger (then PGR, now Category-A)\\n      contributed the QEA formalism, significantly reducing computational complexity, making it more\\n      attractive for NASA.\\n -    Facial Performance Capture: Taylor/Cootes led basic research in face image modelling,\\n      stimulated by applications in face recognition, tracking, and synthesis, with early-stage support\\n      from IF. PDRA Edwards and PGR Walker led commercialisation of the ideas in two companies:\\n      ImageMetrics (both) and Cubic Motion (Edwards), with major impact in films and computer\\n      games.\\n -    Improving Healthcare & Animal Welfare: Cootes/Taylor led research stimulated by\\n      challenges in medical imaging, on fundamental work for statistical models of shape and\\n      appearance of anatomical structures. Its success led to spin-out company, iMorphics, supported\\n      by the IF.\\n1.iv) Supporting Interdisciplinary Research\\nThe University supports the Unit via several “Interdisciplinary Institutes” and platforms: some\\nphysical, some virtual, all resourced with staff-time. The Digital Futures platform (led by Taylor)\\ninvolves Unit members in multiple multi-disciplinary challenges. The Institute for Data Science & A.I.\\ncuts across UoM, connecting e.g. Physics and CS, in a Turing A.I. Fellowship (Scaife, UoA9). The\\nThomas Ashton Institute interfaces with the UK Health & Safety Executive (Jay leads on\\nDigitalisation of Work; Ananiadou leads A.I. in health/safety). The Christabel Pankhurst Institute (led\\nby Taylor/Kaski) channels expertise in A.I. for healthcare technologies.\\nThe University also enables high-profile partnerships relevant to the Unit: e.g. the\\nGBP10,000,000 Smart-City CityVerve project interfaced with local government/SMEs, and a 5-year\\ninstitutional BBC Data Science Partnership (led by the Unit) raises challenges in data science/ethics.\\nWithin the Unit, our virtuous circle strategy requires that clusters of interdisciplinary expertise be\\nsustained and recognised, implementing Principle 3 (Ambition/Curiosity) of our strategy.\\n                                                                                                       Page 5\\n\\n\\nSustaining inter-disciplinary expertise is enabled by: a recruitment policy (2.i) that supports\\nbridging compatible disciplines; a staff development strategy (2.ii) that supports diverse career paths\\n(2.v); a sabbaticals policy (2.iv) that supports a range of leave types; an infrastructure for fostering\\npartnerships (2.v) to support ambitious new endeavours; a PGR funding model and 4 inter-\\ndisciplinary doctoral programmes (2.vii, 2.viii) that encourage interdisciplinarity; and our seminar\\nculture – 60% of Departmental seminars (from 200+ in the period) were tagged as ’interdisciplinary’.\\nRecognising inter-disciplinary expertise is enabled by: our strategy (1.ii) based fundamentally on\\nthe “virtuous circle”; promotions (2.ii) that explicitly recognise interdisciplinarity and impact;\\nreward/recognition structures for all staff/PDRAs/PGRs (2.ix, 3.vi) that value a range of\\ncontributions; an institutional Open Research Policy (1.v) stating freedom of choice for the\\npublication outlet; and ensuring ECRs have sight of interdisciplinary role models (e.g. Cangelosi in\\nrobotics/psychology; Furber in chip design/neuroscience; Goble in biology/e-infrastructure; Taylor in\\nmedical imaging/machine learning).\\nEvidence of Success:\\n    \\uf0b7 Funding: Awards from 8/9 UKRI councils, and collaborative grants with all UoM faculties and\\n         major organisational units.\\n    \\uf0b7 Outputs: We published in journals across 191 Scopus areas, and contributed to the\\n         REF2021 return of 7 other UoAs (see 4.i).\\n    \\uf0b7 PGRs: 10 Unit staff co-supervise 29 PGRs in other departments, e.g. Mathematics,\\n         Psychology. The reverse is also true: 36/245 PGRs in CS are co-supervised by e.g. Law,\\n         Physics. 8 staff co-supervise 10 PGRs beyond UoM, e.g. Edinburgh, ETH Zurich.\\n    \\uf0b7 Leadership: Taylor leads the national UKRI-funded NewMind Technology for Mental Health\\n         Network (4.v), building a multidisciplinary UK community of over 450 academics, clinicians,\\n         patients, and industrialists. Nenadic founded the UK healthcare text-analytics network,\\n         HealTex, with 250+ members.\\n1.v) Our Open Research Environment\\nThe institutional strategy (for details, see REF5a 2.v) is set by the Open Research Strategy Group\\nand the Open Research Working Group (ORWG), co-founded/chaired by Jay. ORWG defines\\ninstitutional policy, which states that (i) outputs will be as open as possible, as early as possible; (ii)\\nresearchers have freedom of choice for the publication outlet; and (iii) the University is committed to\\nresponsible metrics. The policy implements the F.A.I.R. principles, constructed by an international\\nconsortium where the Unit (Goble) was a contributor.\\nOpen Access is an institutional commitment, with library staff supporting the procedures. Web-\\nbased systems enable depositing outputs, paying fees, and managing embargoes. Institutional\\nspend on Gold OA for the Unit was GBP165,022. The UoM OpenAccess+ scheme uses a Media\\nTeam for press releases and professionally edited articles (e.g. The Conversation).\\nOur staff support and lead Open Research: Locally: Our MSc/PhD programmes have open\\nresearch and reproducibility embedded in the curriculum. Nationally: We play key roles in the UK\\nSoftware Sustainability Institute (co-founder: Goble, Research Director: Jay). Internationally:\\nHarper founded the ACM Emerging Interest Group on Reproducibility; Goble is UK representative\\non the European G7 Open Science Working Group, and sits on the UK Open Research Data Task\\nForce.\\n                                                                                                 Page 6\\n\\n\\n1.vi) Ensuring Research Integrity\\nThe Institution maintains a Code of Good Research Conduct, articulating our commitment to\\nresearch integrity, mirrored by a Code of Practice for Investigating Concerns on the Conduct of\\nResearch – ensuring strict but fair investigatory procedures (REF5a 2.v). The overall approach is to\\nraise awareness and monitor compliance.\\nMaintaining ethical standards.\\n        Awareness: a 3-hour Research Integrity course (renewed every 3 years) is mandatory for\\n        PDRAs/academics, with PGR training (2.x) provided by the Unit. A quarterly University-wide\\n        Ethics e-Newsletter, and (in the Unit) a monthly staff newsletter highlights relevant events.\\n        Compliance: Research Ethics Committees (REC) are in place across the Institution,\\n        reporting to the University REC (UREC). Departmental Leads (Vigo/Clinch 0.1FTE) act as\\n        gateway to procedures. There are five levels of approval, from departmental (low-risk PGR\\n        projects), to UREC (high risk, staff/PGR), to national regulations (including NHS REC). The\\n        Unit processed 184 applications (161 approved) 2014-20, at all levels, supported by a\\n        bespoke online ethics system.\\nMeeting legal obligations.\\n        Awareness: Training (mandatory for all academics, renewed biennially) includes: Export\\n        control (2 hours), Information Security & Data Protection (1 hour), EDIA (3 hours). Data\\n        Management: All proposals are required to engage in Data Management Planning\\n        (supported by the Library) via dmponline.ac.uk.\\n        Compliance: The Research Lifecycle Project (3.ii) includes enterprise-grade systems for\\n        confidential data, requiring the highest security. Data Sharing: The central legal team\\n        coordinates NDAs/data-sharing contracts — e.g. recent arrangements include AstraZeneca,\\n        Oracle. Employment Law: All staff involved in PGR admissions and any recruitment panels\\n        must take an Unconscious Bias training course.\\nExemplars of Contributing to professional standards:\\n    \\uf0b7   In programming languages, Pop sits on the OpenMP Language Standards Committee.\\n    \\uf0b7   In robotics/ethical autonomous systems: Fisher is a member of the BSI’s AMT/010/01\\n        Ethics for Robots and Autonomous Systems standards committee. Work by Dennis/Fisher\\n        was cited in BS8611 (“Guide to the ethical design and application of robots and robotic\\n        systems”), the first published standard related to robot ethics.\\n    \\uf0b7   In web-accessibility, Harper is a member of W3C WAI Coordination Group.\\n    \\uf0b7   Jay led the Software Sustainability Institute on REF2021 software guidelines (4.v).\\n                                                                                                Page 7\\n\\n\\n  2. People\\nStaffing Strategy and Staff Development\\n2.i) Staffing and Recruitment Strategy\\nWe seek researchers from a range of backgrounds, guided by 4 processes, each of which is derived\\nfrom one of the 4 research strategy principles.\\n-    Develop/maintain critical mass (implements Principle 1: Critical Mass & Complementarity).\\n        o Actions: We recognise and build on clusters of expertise: establishing leadership, and\\n            ensuring a continuous flow of new talent through succession planning.\\n        o Outcomes: New leadership in cognitive robotics (Cangelosi), Machine Learning (Kaski),\\n            and computer architectures (Goodacre, 0.4FTE joint appointment with ARM). We\\n            ensured a flow of talent by hiring at least 2 ECR academics every year 2015-2020,\\n            covering all 6 of our themes). In total 20/58 staff are new in post (14 ECRs) since 2014.\\n            We maintained critical mass via succession planning within the Future Computing\\n            theme (hiring Rhodes), and in Theory & Foundations (hiring Fisher/Dennis/Dixon).\\n-    Seeking input from staff (implements Principle 2: Empowerment & Support).\\n        o Actions: The HoD actively solicits input from all staff on our recruitment strategy. When\\n            investment is available, the Head of Department (HoD) polls all academic staff on what\\n            the ‘Next Big Thing’ will be, and for names of rising stars in their area. All are encouraged\\n            to take a role in shaping the Unit, contributing their expertise/experience.\\n        o Outcomes: Our People-Data-Chips initiative (1.ii), was suggested by an academic\\n            without a leadership role, and recruited 3 ECRs in ubiquitous computing (Kotselidis,\\n            Clinch, Freitas) who all secured external PI funding within 2 years of appointment.\\n-    Bridging compatible disciplines (implements Principle 3: Ambition & Curiosity).\\n        o Actions: We use strategic hires to bridge clusters and avoid ‘sole-traders’, through e.g.\\n            advertising complementary new posts simultaneously.\\n        o Outcomes: In 2017 we bridged cyber-security/formal methods by hiring Cordeiro and\\n            Lammich. In 2018 we hired Cangelosi in cognitive robotics, naturally interfacing with the\\n            new UoM Engineering structures. In 2020, activity in robotics and formal verification was\\n            bridged by hiring Fisher/Dixon/Dennis.\\n-    Pursuing equity in applications (implements Principle 4: Responsibility).\\n        o Actions: All academic job postings are run through software to identify gender-biased\\n            language. All shortlisting uses a ‘second-look’ policy to ensure equitable reasons for\\n            inclusion/exclusion. All panels involve at least one female academic, and all undergo\\n            mandatory EDIA training. Part-time appointments are considered for all posts and\\n            explicitly pursued when appropriate (e.g. personal reasons, or to maintain industry roles).\\n        o Outcomes: Our Category-A gender profile (at the census date) is 26% female, versus\\n            22% nationally (source: 2019 HESA centre 121), and 30% of all in-period appointments\\n            were female. The breakdown by gender profile is below. At the census date, among all\\n            research and academic staff, 19% are BAME – compared to 14% in the UK working\\n            age population (source: BCS Diversity Report 2020).\\n                                    FTE        Headcount        #male : #female        % female\\n              Lecturer              13.3            14                9:5                 36%\\n          Senior Lecturer           14.9            16                13 : 3              19%\\n               Reader               4.8             5                 2:3                 60%\\n                 Prof               20.1            23                19 : 4              17%\\n                 Total              53.1            58               43 : 15              26%\\nTo ensure long-term critical mass (Principle 1) and provide career stability (Principle 4), we have\\nno short-term Category-A contracts.\\n                                                                                                   Page 8\\n\\n\\n2.ii) Staff Development\\nOur staff development strategy (see also PDRA-specific support in 2.iii) pursues three goals, that\\nemerge from our guiding principles.\\n \\uf0b7    to identify/support upward trajectories (P2: Empowerment): We recognise that our variously\\n      talented staff benefit from specific resources to continue their trajectory. This is enabled via\\n      regular appraisal, mentoring, and support to pursue fellowships (e.g. feedback rounds on drafts,\\n      and mock interviews).\\n\\uf0b7    to actively consider ‘growth opportunities’ at critical career points (P3: Ambition): When\\n     career-defining opportunities arise, individuals benefit from specific encouragement/support\\n     breaking into leadership roles. This is enabled via interlinked senior staff meetings (e.g.\\n     Promotions Committee makes recommendations to Duties Allocation committee, which assigns\\n     leadership roles and in turn recommends sabbaticals to the Leave of Absence Committee (2.iv).\\n\\uf0b7    to ensure diverse career paths are recognised (P4: Responsibility): Excellent people come\\n     from a wide range of backgrounds, and many have non-traditional career paths. Recognising\\n     this, recruitment and promotions policies acknowledge a range of contributions.\\nFurther details on how the strategy is implemented:\\nMentoring is mandatory for ECR academics, via trained staff balanced in gender/seniority. Many\\nECRs benefit from early/mid-career mentors, who have empathy with their situation. The University\\n“Manchester Gold” scheme provides cross-discipline mentoring , matching junior/senior staff (e.g.\\nCangelosi mentors a UoA12 PDRA). Appraisal/individual development needs are supported via\\nline managers in annual Performance & Development Reviews, offered to all academics/PDRAs.\\nIndividual ambitions and training needs are discussed, and action plans agreed. This is iteratively\\nrefined, and reported back to the Probation Committee (for ECR academics) and to the HoD.\\nFellowship eligibility/deadlines are tracked (see support teams in 3.i), and cases actively solicited.\\nProbation lasts 3 years: specific tailored objectives are agreed during induction, discussed annually\\nwith managers, reviewed by the Department Promotions Committee. Expectations are set at Faculty-\\nlevel, in 4 categories: (Research, Teaching, Knowledge Transfer, Service/Leadership), with precise\\nwording, e.g. “Submission of at least one research proposal per year that achieves good reviews”.\\nPromotions are considered annually, assessing 4 areas: research, teaching, service/leadership,\\nand knowledge transfer – where parity of esteem is emphasised. Expectations have unambiguous\\nlanguage and measurable outcomes. Two meetings consider cases and provide feedback; each\\napplicant has an assigned “shepherd” from the committee, to develop their case. As some\\ndemographics tend to underestimate their chances, the committee actively solicits cases. Off-\\nschedule one-off pay increments are possible under a separate “Rewarding Exceptional\\nAchievement” policy, for any academic/PDRA.\\nTraining: The VITAE Researcher Development Framework maps directly to a portfolio of 38 courses\\n(1-5 hours each) across 5 areas: Career Management, Research & Enterprise, Communication,\\nLeadership & Management, Teaching & Learning. UoM holds a European Commission HR\\nExcellence in Research Award for the Concordat Implementation Plan, awarded in 2011, retained in\\n2020 after external review. The Inspiring Leaders programme provides 50 hours over 6 months for\\nsenior leadership. The Unit provides CS-specific training: e.g. role-playing mock EPSRC panel to\\nclarify how funding decisions are made. Encouraging female leadership is a priority: four staff (Zhao,\\nJay, Clinch, Batista) were funded for leadership training (StellarHE, AdvanceHE Aurora).\\n                                                                                               Page 9\\n\\n\\n2.iii) Support for Early Career Researchers\\nThe Unit develops ECRs (PGRs, PDRAs, and new academics) through: (i) training that provides a\\nfoundation for a diversity of careers; and (ii) the provision of time/resources that launch independent\\nresearch careers – implementing Principle 2 (Empowerment/Support). The Institution assists with\\nfull implementation of the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers, which\\npermeates our environment (REF5a 3.3.2).\\nTraining: The institutional “New Academics Programme” comprises a mandatory 50 hours (HEA-\\naccredited) over 18 months, also available to PDRAs (2.ii). For research, this includes e.g.\\ngrantsmanship, PGR recruitment. For knowledge transfer/impact: e.g. IP, and public engagement.\\nIn the Unit, a budget is available for national ECR events, e.g. CHERISH-DE “Digital Economy\\nCrucible” (Batista/Clinch). PDRA support: ECR academic, Mustafa, holds a duty (0.1FTE) as\\n“PDRA Champion”, fostering a PDRA culture of social/professional development. All PDRAs are\\ninformed of (and encouraged to participate in) the various opportunities in the Researcher\\nDevelopment programme.\\nTime/resources: To establish research, new academics “ramp-up” to full teaching/administrative\\nduties: initially 40% of their FTE (whether full/part-time), increasing 20% annually. All new academics\\n(regardless of FTE or contract) receive GBP5,000 unrestricted funds and a PhD studentship. An\\ninduction pack welcomes all academics/PDRAs, and an informal but professional culture is\\nsupported with frequent social events. A bi-monthly ECR Lunch is hosted by the HoD, on themes\\nchosen by ECRs: e.g. supervision skills, and managing workload.\\nEvidence of success: In the period, we hired 14 new Category-A staff (Lindner, Olivier,\\nPetoumenos, Lammich, Rhodes, Mustafa, Cordeiro, Freitas, Kotselidis, Battista, Mu, Clinch, Reger,\\nVigo) All of these obtained funding as PI/Co-I within 2 years of appointment; 5 with competitive\\nfellowships (Lindner, Batista, Pop, Mustafa, Petoumenos). Two hold major awards as PI: Cordeiro,\\n(EP/T026995/1, GBP1,721,559), Reger (EP/V000497/1, GBP1,034,989).\\nMany PDRAs grow careers within the Institution : 5 of our Category-A staff were PDRAs in REF2014\\n(Vigo, Kotselidis, Batista, Rhodes, Reger). Others choose industry: e.g. Ghasempour (PDRA 2012-\\n15, now Head of Machine Learning, The Hut Group); Sechidis (PDRA 2015-18, now Senior Scientist,\\nNovartis); Haines (PDRA 2014, now institutional Head of Research IT, also UK Society for Research\\nSoftware Engineering co-founder).\\n2.iv) Policies for Research/Impact/Sabbatical Leave\\nThe policy: Academics are eligible for sabbaticals of 1 semester after 3 years’ service, or 1 full year\\nafter 6 years. These are unconstrained; on-site, cross-departmental, or international, and target\\noutcomes are broad: e.g. industrial/social impact, grant preparation, or re-focus of research area.\\nWe allow ‘mini-sabbaticals’ from duties like tutorials/projects, to protect contiguous blocks of time.\\nWe encourage multi-year leave, e.g. two second semesters, enabling longer-term activity.\\nProcedure: Cases are solicited annually, including actively seeking applications, and taking\\nrecommendations from other senior committees. Cases are prepared with line manager support,\\nand reviewed by the Leave of Absence Committee, with membership monitored for diversity.\\nOutcomes: 29 took major leave: 13 for a single semester, 16 for a full year, and 10 had ‘mini-\\nsabbaticals’. Nenadic took a 2015 sabbatical to shift focus to temporal text-analytics – enabling\\nBBSRC grant (GBP730,460, BB/N019547/1) on modelling veterinary health records.\\n                                                                                                Page 10\\n\\n\\n2.v) Fostering Interfaces for Knowledge Exchange\\nOur impact strategy (1.iii) is further supported by fostering relationships, via 3 key activities which\\ntogether implement Principles 1 (Critical Mass/Complementarity) and 3 (Ambition).\\n     \\uf0b7   We pursue and maintain strategic partnerships: We engage with both top-down MoUs\\n         (e.g. ARM Centre of Excellence) and bottom-up (e.g. personal contacts at local SME,\\n         Peak.ai). Our Industry Club is a stepping-stone to deeper relationships – the 200+ members\\n         are invited to events (e.g. PGR Symposium) and informed of activity via quarterly newsletters.\\n     \\uf0b7   We recruit from diverse career paths, e.g. 4 academics had industrial careers of 5+ years\\n         (Cordeiro, Goodacre, Kotselidis, Rhodes) prior to Manchester, and 5 Category-A staff have\\n         joint industrial appointments (Voronkov, Paton, Goodacre, Kotselidis, Pavlidis).\\n         Secondments can be taken at short-notice, and duties adjusted – e.g. a short-notice part-\\n         time post at ARM Ltd (Brown), led to a patent and investment (GBP50,000) to the Unit.\\n     \\uf0b7   We connect MScs and PGRs to the pipeline: The early stages of a relationship require\\n         small-scale interactions, which we achieve by engaging new researchers — in the period 64\\n         industry-partnered MSc research projects, and 9 PGR internships, were arranged.\\nFurther outcomes: We enjoyed major new collaborations with e.g. AstraZeneca, BBC R&D, Oracle\\n(4.ii). We hosted 14 CASE/iCASEs (6 in REF2014). We supported the foundation of 3 spinouts by\\nstaff/PGRs (ExGence, Eurimatics, Data Value Factory), and growth of two others (Cogniscience,\\niMorphics), both of which aided our impact case portfolio.\\n2.vi) Recognising, Rewarding, and Supporting Research with Impact\\nDetails of how we support the achievement of impact from research are in 1.iii, 3.v, and 4.ii. To\\nrecognise/reward successes, a variety of mechanisms are in place. Examples: In Abstract is a\\nFaculty-level web-archive of world-class papers, with press releases curated by Marketing &\\nCommunications, recognising success regardless of subject. Better World is an institutional\\nceremony for research with social impact, and Postdoc Appreciation Week has web-\\nprofiles/interviews with PDRAs, and funded social events. Personalised letters from the President\\nrecognise major successes (e.g. fellowships). In the Unit, the weekly newsletter names and\\ncelebrates all successes, from PGR prizes to Professorial Inaugurals.\\nOur Postgraduate Researchers\\n2.vii) PGR Recruitment\\nThe recruitment of diverse and excellent PGRs is central to our mission, enabled by initiatives which\\nimplement Principle 1 (Critical Mass and Complementarity) and 4 (Responsibility). These are (i)\\ndedicating significant resources to recruitment; (ii) having a diversity of programmes (iii)\\npursuing a diversity of candidates; (iv) achieving the ‘right fit’ through meaningful engagement.\\n   (i) Resources: Processes are unified across the Faculty, ensuring applicants can be\\n   recommended cross-departmentally. In the Unit, academic roles: PGR Director (0.2FTE), Deputy\\n   (0.1FTE), PGR Marketing lead (0.1FTE), are supported by administrative staff, and in-house\\n   software to distribute applications, collect feedback, and send out offers. The average time from\\n   application to decision is 4 weeks. At institutional level, Nenadic is Faculty PGR Committee Chair.\\n   (ii) Diversity of PGR Programmes: We participate in 4 interdisciplinary doctoral training\\n   programmes: 4IR-STFC CDT in Data-Intensive Science, ESRC Data Analytics & Society CDT,\\n   EPSRC Graphene NOWNANO CDT, and a psychology/robotics programme with the Italian\\n   Institute of Technology. A new EngD programme was established (2019), to support PGRs based\\n   primarily in industry, and we changed progression timings to support extended internships.\\n                                                                                               Page 11\\n\\n\\n    (iii) Diversity of Candidates: We offer 50+ annual fee waivers for the China Scholarship Council;\\n    and UoM advertises 100 President’s Doctoral Scholarships, the first annual round restricted to\\n    overseas applicants (10 in-programme). We “grow our own” via Manchester MSc/UG\\n    programmes aligning with research strengths; e.g. of 245 current PGRs, 9% came from our UG\\n    programme, and 28% hold a Manchester degree (UG/PGT, any discipline). EDIA: Disability\\n    Support is advertised widely, and we provide structural adaptations to the environment (2.xi).\\n    (iv) Achieving the right `fit’: Virtual and physical PGR Open Days allow candidates to meet\\n    staff, and experience the environment before committing. Interviews for all admissions/funding,\\n    have a rotating panel of 5 academics (membership, and interviewees, monitored by PGR Director\\n    for equity in gender, ethnic origin, and research area). In the period, 15 PGRs have opted for part-\\n    time enrolment to suit personal circumstances (9 in-programme).\\nOutcomes: Our programmes have attracted applications from all over the world (34 countries;\\nnormally 70% overseas). In the period, 16 declared a disability, with 7 receiving explicit funded\\nsupport (e.g. screen-readers and adapted office space).\\n2.viii) PGR Studentships\\nTo enable a high-quality, diverse PGR cohort - following strategy Principle 4 (Responsibility) - we\\naccess a broad range of funding sources, and Departmental funds/fee waivers support PGRs without\\nfunding. Departmental funds support new academics’ start-up packages, strategically important\\nproposals, and areas of research growth. In addition, UoM provides Dean’s Awards and President’s\\nDoctoral Scholarships to outstanding candidates, competitive across the University.\\nWe have taken active steps to grow our PGR activity as a driver for research vitality. At the census\\ndate the unit had 245 in-programme PGRs (a 91% increase, compared to 128 at the end of the\\nprevious period – see REF2014 5b). Of these 42 were UKRI-funded: 28 EPSRC CDT/DTP, 11\\nEPSRC iCASE (e.g. BAE, EDF), 3 EPSRC CASE; 22 were funded by competitive President’s and\\nDean’s awards, 62 by overseas governments, 7 split-site funded by the Italian Institute of\\nTechnology, and 44 self-funded. Furthermore, we have significantly increased departmental\\ninvestment in PGRs, with an average spend of GBP836,000 p.a. on a combination of studentship\\nfee-waivers and stipends, up from GBP500,000 in REF2014 – a 67% increase. This resulted in\\nfull/partial funding for 178 of our current cohort, up 254% from 70 in 2014.\\n2.ix) PGR Support and Progress Monitoring\\nPGR Support\\n     \\uf0b7 Supervisory teams: Every PGR has a main supervisor, one or more co-supervisors, and a\\n          cohort advisor. Supervisors monitor technical progress; advisors provide pastoral support\\n          with weekly meetings in groups of 6, and on-demand one-on-one meetings.\\n     \\uf0b7    Peer support: All spend their first 6 months in the ‘PGR Home’ area (custom-built 2017\\n          GBP60,000); where cross-group cohorts support multi-disciplinarity. Senior PGRs participate\\n          in our PGR Mentors scheme, and representatives sit on Staff/PGR committee.\\n     \\uf0b7    Recognising/rewarding success: The PGR Symposium is an annual highlight, with talks\\n          by 3rd-years, posters by 2nd-years, keynotes (2019: Simon Segars, ARM CEO), industry\\n          prizes (currently IBM Research), and two Professor’s prizes for best paper/thesis.\\n     \\uf0b7    Mental health: In 2018, Research England and the Office for Students awarded funds for\\n          UoM’s “Well Bee-ing” PGR Mental Health Project. Among the outcomes (implemented in\\n          UoM policy, recommended nationally by OfS) was to review length/structure of programmes,\\n          and to promote mindfulness in PGRs.\\n     \\uf0b7    Extensive training (for details see 2.x)\\n                                                                                              Page 12\\n\\n\\nPGR progress monitoring\\n    \\uf0b7 An institutional electronic progression system tracks PGR milestones, records training\\n         needs, and sets expectations at quarterly intervals, with supervisor and PGR Director sign-\\n         off. The annual progression process requires the PGR to deliver a report and presentation\\n         on progress and plans, with interviews by two academics outside the area.\\nEvidence of Success:\\nA step-change in PGR pastoral care (2017, e.g. cohort advisors) helped first-year progression: 75%\\n(2014) to 98% (2018) to 100% (2019).\\nAt international conferences, our PGRs won 11 Best Paper prizes with the PGR as first author –\\ne.g. D’Antras et al 2017 (PLDI Distinguished Paper), and Arrelanes et al 2018 (ICIoT Best Paper);\\nwhilst a journal article resulting from a PhD thesis (Nikolaou, EPSRC CDT-funded) received an ACM\\nComputing: Notable Article of 2016 commendation (Nikolaou et al, 2016).\\nIn REF2, 35% of our outputs have a PGR as first author.\\n2.x) Details of PGR Training\\nUnit-level: All PGRs attend 4 full-semester courses on Scientific Methods (40 contact hours plus\\n130 offline), plus skills workshops (30 hours). Optional computing courses are available for cross-\\ndisciplinary PGRs. Attendance on MSc modules is encouraged to specialise knowledge. Faculty-\\nlevel: All PGRs can take mini-courses across 49 topics: research (16), TA training (6),\\nimpact/engagement (12), career management (3), and wellbeing (12)..\\nIndividual Training Funds: Every PGR has GBP3,000 to enhance training: e.g. conferences,\\nregardless of publication – approval is light-touch, and via supervisor, group lead, or PGR Director.\\nIT resources are separate, with machines replaced as needed. EDIA: Some PGRs were reluctant to\\nrequest funds from their supervisor, so we heavily promoted the fund and alternative approval\\nmechanisms (implementing P2: Empowerment).\\nWe prepare PGRs for diverse careers. Industrial: 9 PGRs took internships, e.g. BBC, IBM.\\nOutreach: 3 PGRs joined our Project Malawi programme; PGRs co-hosted 7 Nuffield Foundation\\nplacement pupils; 4 PGRs are STEM ambassadors. For academic careers, EPSRC Doctoral Prizes\\nare a springboard (6 in-period) e.g. Nikolaou 2016, now senior RF, UCL Astrophysics.\\n2.xi) Equality and Diversity\\nSocial Responsibility is one of three core goals of UoM, reflected in duty roles at Faculty, School,\\nand Department level. Policies embedded throughout the Institution create the desired culture: for\\nexample, an appointments policy that implements a version of the Mansfield Rule. At Departmental\\nlevel, strategy is coordinated by the EDIA committee (4 academics, 1 RF, 2 PGRs) meeting\\nquarterly. For oversight/guidance, we follow charter schemes, e.g. Athena Swan Bronze award,\\nrenewed 2020 (for full list of schemes, see REF5a 3.2).\\nCommitment to EDIA in Career Pathways\\nAppointments: Adverts are vetted by a software gendered-text analyser. Part-time appointments\\nare considered for all roles at advertisement-stage wherever possible. Internal research leadership\\nroles are advertised to all and applicants are encouraged to have informal discussions with relevant\\nsenior staff. At all panels, a member of EDIA committee is required.\\n                                                                                            Page 13\\n\\n\\nSupport for promotions: Our ‘shepherding’ scheme (2.ii) ensures writing support for all applicants,\\nstrengthened by explicit support for social anxieties (3.iv), and three rounds of drafts/reviews before\\nsubmission.\\nSupport for acquiring funding: Statistics are monitored by Faculty, and corrective actions taken\\nas appropriate, e.g. soliciting fellowship applications from under-represented groups (also 3.iv).\\nPart-time staff: Several academics choose part-time employment (11/58 individuals, 0.3-0.8FTE),\\nfor maintaining industry roles, or personal reasons. Reduced FTE does not restrict progression—all\\ncommittees (e.g. promotions) explicitly acknowledge individual circumstances, scaling expectations.\\nIn the period we promoted one individual (0.4FTE) to Professor (teaching-focused), one (0.8FTE) to\\nReader, and one (0.5FTE) to SL; and 8 academics/senior RFs reduced FTE for flexible retirement.\\nFixed-term staff: The UoM Policy Contracts of Employment (revised 2017) provides protection for\\nfixed-term employees. At contract end a PDRA is placed on the Redeployment Register (enabling\\npreferential consideration for internal posts).\\nCommitment to EDIA in Support of Staff/PGRs\\nThe Leave of Absence Committee manages study leave via transparent processes. Membership\\nensures representation across ethnicity, gender, career-stage, and career track. We recognise many\\ntypes of leave (2.iv). In the period, 29 took sabbaticals: 35% female, 14% BAME, 10% with disclosed\\nlong-term health issues.\\nCaring responsibilities are supported by a broad recognition of leave-types: maternity, paternity,\\nshared, and adoption (3 staff took parental/adoption leave, and 2 reduced hours for child-care).\\nArrangements with local nurseries permit salary-sacrifice. A New Parents’ Room has a fridge and\\nappropriate privacy. PGRs access Equal Mobility Grants (GBP500 per trip) for caring responsibility.\\nLong-term health issues are accommodated by workload adjustments (e.g. one individual was\\nremoved from teaching requiring a lot of typing, due to severe RSI). Arrangements for healthy\\nworking follow occupational health guidelines (e.g. 8 standing desks on-site, GBP2,000 spent\\nannually on specialist seating). Exemptions are made to the policy norm (of off-peak and non-first-\\nclass travel) for health reasons (2 staff use Business Class when appropriate).\\nReturning from leave is supported by institutional phased return policies. New academics retain\\ntheir FTE ramp-up, while PGRs receive 12-month interruptions for parental leave, and on return have\\na no-fees extension, phasing back to studies. In the period 60 PGRs interrupted for personal reasons\\n(16 paternity/maternity; 4 switched full to part-time).\\nFlexible/remote working is supported. Duties allocation processes acknowledge part-time\\nworking, various types of leave, and requests for caring/wellbeing issues. Departmental meetings\\nare scheduled during core hours (10:00-16:00), and VPN access enables secure home-working. On-\\nsite, a fully multimedia-equipped room is used for Departmental Leadership meetings, enabling 2\\nstaff to participate remotely (due to caring responsibilities/health issues).\\nSupport for protected characteristics is embedded in University policies. Targeted promotions\\nguidance is provided for under-represented groups. Occupational Health guidance is available to\\nadvise on reasonable adjustments for accessibility. Support for acquiring funding and accessing\\ninfrastructure is addressed in (3.iv).\\nWellbeing is supported by the built environment and a culture of healthy-working. We have a rolling\\nprogramme of refurbishment, e.g. daylight-LED lighting, and increased social space for\\nserendipitous meetings. Monthly “Coffee with HoD” coffee-mornings (maintained virtually during\\nlockdown) encourage mingling.\\n                                                                                               Page 14\\n\\n\\nCommitment to EDIA in our REF return\\nIn our return we increased the proportion of female REF-eligible staff: 20% (9/46) in 2014, to 26%\\n(15/58) in 2021.\\nOur output return had multiple EDIA checks. Unit-level: A committee of senior and ECR academics\\nestimated grades. The grading protocols and membership were under continuous revision to avoid\\nbias. We examined attributions on gender/ethnicity for systematic bias. All submitted outputs were\\ndiscussed 1-on-1 with authors. Institutional: Statistics were examined by an HR team with access\\nto protected characteristics, reporting anomalies to Units where necessary – none arose for our Unit\\n(across ethnicity, gender, and nationality, the number of attributed outputs matched the staffing\\nprofile). Our environment statement uses exemplars drawn from across the Unit. We polled staff\\n3 times soliciting “success stories”, and making clear that anybody, at any career stage, can\\ncontribute. Our impact portfolio was selected on merit alone, with multiple checks at Unit, Faculty,\\nand University level, after polling staff for cases on multiple occasions 2016-2020.\\n                                                                                           Page 15\\n\\n\\n  3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n3.i) Research Funding\\nWe aim to maintain a diverse funding portfolio, whilst increasing collaboration as much as possible.\\nOur strategy is to promote awareness for a range of mechanisms, and release scholarly time to\\napply, all facilitated end-to-end by support staff.\\n\\uf0b7    Promoting awareness: A monthly digest of diverse opportunities is distributed to all academics.\\n     Time-critical calls are monitored by the Research Support Manager, cascaded to staff. Annual\\n     fellowship cycles are tracked in an electronic system, with automated alerts.\\n\\uf0b7    Releasing ‘scholarly’ time: Our workload system leaves 0.2FTE unassigned, enabling time for\\n     free-thinking. ECRs benefit from gradual duty ramp-up (2.iii), managed via fully-open workload\\n     formulae. Regular rounds of institutional seed-funding (light-touch review) support new ideas\\n     (e.g. 3 academics hired by our People-Data-Chips initiative were supported by GBP45,000 to\\n     establish a new IoT lab).\\n\\uf0b7    Peer support: Examples of successful grants are shared, alongside an established internal\\n     peer-review culture by experienced staff, and internal workshops (e.g. an annual EPSRC mock\\n     panel) disseminate best practice. School-level initiatives encourage fellowships with a wider suite\\n     of engineering perspectives, supporting cross-departmental collaboration. Mock interviews are\\n     organised for fellowships, sourcing experienced staff from across UoM.\\n\\uf0b7    Administrative support: The Unit has Research Support/Finance teams providing end-to-end\\n     support for project lifecycles, including all costing/administration of proposals, HR liaison,\\n     contracts, export control, and financial reporting. Each member of academic staff has a named\\n     Research Support and Research Finance officer to work with. Research Support Managers\\n     provide leadership to teams, and strategic support to the HoD.\\nThe average annual Unit income (sum of all REF4b categories) increased 12% to GBP8,348,693,\\nwith total EU government sources more than tripling in the period, from GBP5,238,585 to\\nGBP17,968,580. Income per FTE, per year, is shown below – in 2013/14, the Unit ranked 12th in the\\nUK for this metric, rising through the period (2017/18, 1st), and 2018/19 (3rd).\\nThis income came from a diversity of awards (e.g. funding from 8/9 UKRI councils) with a total of\\n225 awards from 80 distinct funders, equating to GBP80,905,374 revenue. The number of awards\\nannually increased 54% in the period (26 in 2014, up to 40 in 2019).

In parallel: a Research Strategy and Innovation team (9FTE) assist with strategic\\npartnerships; the Knowledge Exchange team (5FTE) support KTPs/IAAs, and the Innovation Factory\\nLtd (IF), a wholly-owned UoM company, handled commercialisation of University innovations - the\\nUnit has an assigned IF “partner”, based in our building, who pro-actively pursues IP opportunities.\\nA central Contracts team deal with all legal issues and NDAs.\\nInvestment in Relevant Research Areas: The institutional Digital Futures platform stimulates and\\nsupports collaboration in digital technologies – UoM employs 6FTE support staff for this, and the\\nUnit plays a leading role with Taylor as Director, and Jay on the Management Board. The Pankhurst\\nInstitute channels expertise in healthcare technologies: two Unit staff provide leadership - interim\\nInstitute Director (Taylor) and Research Director (Kaski), and investments from UoM, EPSRC, and\\nThe Alan Turing Institute provide a working budget of GBP25,000,000.\\nTechnical/Support Staff: Research IT maintains 40FTE baselined staff: 2 group leaders, 25\\nResearch Software Engineers, 13 infrastructure engineers. This enables an agile approach to tools\\nand secondment, whilst supporting institutional memory. Outcomes: The Unit costed 33.5 years of\\nRSE time into funded projects, e.g. a COVID rapid-response collaboration (Jay, COV0659,\\nGBP412,720), an evaluation framework for the Test & Trace programme: two reports (using the\\nsoftware) delivered to Sage via SPI-M.\\nHigh Performance Compute: The Institution maintains a compute facility of 18,512 CPU cores\\n(varying for workload) and 90 Nvidia v100s. This pool is regularly refreshed (2014-20,\\nGBP4,000,000), plus GBP100,000 annual spend on AWS GPU time. The Unit utilised over 284\\nCPU/GPU years, e.g. large-scale GPU benchmarks against our SpiNNaker neuromorphic machine.\\nSubscriptions/Collections: UoM provides site licences for Overleaf, Dropbox, Office365, Zoom,\\nTeams, and Mathematica — available for all staff/PDRAs/PGRs. CS-specific licences are paid by\\nthe Unit (e.g. Cadence for circuit design).\\n3.iii) Support Infrastructure within the Unit\\nUnit investment for recruitment into strategic research areas is covered in 1.ii.\\nEstate/Facilities: The Unit invests to support distinctive areas of research, for example – bespoke\\npower/air-con space for SpiNNaker (GBP200,000), securing availability to the EU for the foreseeable\\nfuture; and a ‘Living Lab’ for cognitive robotics research (GBP250,000). The Unit benefits from the\\nongoing GBP1,000,000,000 institutional master-plan, developing labs to support interdisciplinary\\nresearch in robotics and computer engineering.\\nTechnical and Support Staff: In the period, the Unit funded four technicians to support specialist\\nresearch infrastructure, requiring expertise beyond that available from institutional Research IT –\\ne.g. one provides extensive experience with chip design CAD software (helping PGRs/PDRAs), and\\nanother was a key contributor to SpiNNaker, assembling and fault-checking the final machine.\\nThe Unit also baselined a Software Engineer who developed a comprehensive infrastructure to\\nsupport our REF submission, also deployed across the entire Institution. This included a fully-\\nalgorithmic optimisation scheme to select/attribute outputs, (thus avoiding unconscious bias, and\\nensuring compliance with REF2021), collaboratively developed with academics (Brown, Pratt-\\nHartmann).\\n                                                                                            Page 18\\n\\n\\n3.iv) EDIA in Acquiring Funding/Accessing Infrastructure\\nWe summarise some specific actions in the Unit, implementing strategy Principle 4 (Responsibility).\\nThe overall EDIA initiative is detailed in Section 2.xi.\\nIndividual Mentoring: We host highly-focused individuals, some challenged by social interactions.\\nOn 2 specific occasions during the period, individuals received additional mentoring (from a trained\\nsenior Professor) on grant-writing and PGR supervision.\\nWorkload: The Departmental Leadership Team is conscious that individuals with protected\\ncharacteristics are often requested to serve on institutional committees/initiatives – and can be\\noverloaded, which may affect research. To avoid this, our duty-allocation system is fully-transparent,\\nand statistics on such assignments are delivered annually to the HoD for any corrective action.\\nOpportunities: We heavily promote gender-specific opportunities (e.g. L\\'Oréal-UNESCO For\\nWomen in Science Programme), via the departmental newsletter.\\nAccessibility: All buildings are wheelchair-accessible. Visually-impaired colleagues (1 academic, 2\\nPGRs) receive support for meetings across campus. An office was converted to fully dark-space for\\na PDRA with light-sensitivity (cost GBP1,500). We repurposed 2 toilets to gender-neutral. We have\\n1 Stonewall-trained LGBTQ+ ally to support gender-transitioning staff/students. UoM provides\\nlicences for assistive technologies (e.g. MindGenius for dyslexia, JAWS screen-reader).\\n3.v) How we use our Infrastructure and Expertise for Impact\\nSignificant institutional infrastructure exists to support KTPs/IAAs, IP exploitation, and general\\nacceleration of impact opportunities (1.iii for details).\\nUnit staff provided short-term consultancy for large organisations, e.g. ARM (Brown/Furber),\\nGCHQ (Pettifer), BBC (Jay), Babylon Health (Schmidt), Elsevier (Goble), and for local SMEs:\\nUrbanChain (Banach), Tachyum Ltd (Furber).\\nExamples directly relating to our REF impact portfolio and inward investment:\\n    \\uf0b7 Cootes consulted for Aviagen, one of the world’s leading breeders of chickens, applying\\n        computer vision systems to improve health of their stock (see impact case).\\n    \\uf0b7   Kotselidis is 0.5FTE as Cybersecurity Manager for KTM A.G., the largest EU manufacturer\\n        of powered motorcycles: this enabled ELEGANT (H2020-957286, EUR4,983,250),\\n        developing secure vehicle-to-vehicle communications.\\n3.vi) Specialist Research Infrastructure\\nCognitive Robotics Lab: a dedicated “Living Lab”, for human-robot experiments, laid out as a living\\nspace. The lab has 9 robot platforms including iCub, Pepper (×3), Sawyer, Giraff, and Nao (×3),\\nenabled by a GBP250,000 institutional investment.\\nInteraction Analysis/Modelling Suite: equipped for user evaluations, including Tobii eye-trackers,\\nand galvanic skin-response equipment. This enabled collaborations with BBC, that in turn supported\\nthe BBC Data Science Partnership.\\nInternet of Things: An institutional investment (GBP45,000) supports IoT research, including\\nMeshlium Scanners for estimation of crowd density, and Libelium CymbIots for monitoring\\nenvironmental parameters.\\n                                                                                              Page 19\\n\\n\\n3.vii) Shared Research Infrastructure\\nSpiNNaker is a unique neuromorphic computer, designed/built at Manchester, available through the\\nEU FET Flagship Human Brain Project. This is available for use by any lab world-wide — and at the\\ntime of writing has run 5 million jobs for over 400 users worldwide.\\nFAIRDOM-SEEK (led by Goble) is a software platform for systems biologists to organise FAIR\\nresearch outputs: the system is used worldwide by 140 major projects - including national\\nprogrammes in patient data-sharing (Germany), and crop plant data-sharing (Belgium, France).\\nWithin this, FAIRDOMHub is a web-accessible registry for assets of biology projects: used by 204\\nprojects, including the COVID disease paths international collaboration of 259 researchers.\\nRobotics: Several UoM projects (e.g. H2020 MoveCare) enable equipment-sharing between\\ninstitutions, e.g. the Giraff telepresence robot, and the GBP30,000 Sawyer, used by students from\\nItaly, and Waseda University (Japan).\\nAn exa-scale HPC system is being constructed by the Unit (H2020 EuroEXA) that minimizes\\nenergy consumption, with a world-leading 100kW per-rack thermal density infrastructure. With 256\\ncompute nodes (each consisting of a hybrid FPGA+CPU custom architecture) the system is one of\\nthe largest FPGA-accelerated clusters in the world, consisting 544 Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGA devices.\\nThe system is currently used by 15 development teams across 7 European nations.\\n3.viii) Benefits In-Kind\\nIntellectual Property:\\n     \\uf0b7 ARM Ltd donate design specifications for the ARM Cortex-M4, valued by ARM at\\n         GBP1,500,000 annually - this enables the SpiNNaker2 project.

Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society\\n4.i) Enabling Academic Collaboration\\nOur recruitment strategy (2.i, implementing P1: Critical Mass/Complementarity) leads to a\\ndiverse pool of expertise, with complementary interests – staff willing and able to “look outwards”\\nto other disciplines/institutions (P3: Ambition/Curiosity).\\nThis expertise is sustained and recognised - see Section 1.iv for how this is achieved.\\nBuilding on this solid base, Principle 2 (Empowerment/Support) leads us to provide the funding\\nand opportunities to launch new collaborations, as our people see fit.\\n     \\uf0b7  Funding: University-level seed-funding is available to stimulate collaboration - e.g. School of\\n        Engineering collaborative grants, GBP50,000 maximum, multiple annual rounds, with light-\\n        touch review. Within the Unit, an equal distribution of flexible funding to groups (GBP120,000\\n        in 2019/20) supports both serendipitous and planned cross-institutional visits.\\n     \\uf0b7  Opportunities within/beyond UoM are promoted widely, while local events enable meetings,\\n        e.g. the IDSAI “Advances in Data Science” seminars (43 since 2016) are highly cross-\\n        disciplinary, and cross-institutional in audience. In the Unit, our culture of collegiality and\\n        openness (P4: Responsibility) leads to exchange of opportunities among staff (example in\\n        4.ii) and a light-touch visitor policy supports short-term visits.\\nOutcomes:\\nCollaborative projects: Across 52 EU projects, we partnered with 660 different organisations. We\\nhave 8 long-standing partners, each collaborating on 10+ EU projects: Barcelona Supercomputing\\nCentre (23 projects); CNRS France (14); INRIA (10); CNR Italy (10); Fraunhofer (14); EMBL (14);\\nCEA France (10); and Edinburgh (11).\\nFor UKRI, we held 104 collaborative projects (with 46 UK academic institutions) where 44/104\\ninvolved another UoM Unit, showing local cross-disciplinary working.

Furber leads the HBP\\n       neuromorphic sub-project, and sits on the HBP Science Infrastructure Board.\\n    \\uf0b7  ELIXIR. In eScience (Goble) we have long-standing collaborations to develop infrastructure\\n       managing biological data, e.g. ELIXIR, the European inter-governmental Research\\n       Infrastructure for Life Sciences, where Goble leads the UK Node (18 organisations), enabling\\n       our participation in seven EU projects (46 organisations, 23 countries), including the US\\n       National Institutes of Health and seven pharmaceutical companies.\\n    \\uf0b7  OpenPHACTS: Goble/Pettifer/Stevens developed an entity-matching method, incorporated\\n       into the EU OpenPHACTS platform for pharmacological data. This prompted adoption of\\n       knowledge graphs by the pharma industry - the system (with our method at its core) has\\n       processed over 500m queries, from public/private organisations worldwide.\\n    \\uf0b7  EuroEXA: Goodacre is Technical Director for the 16-partner, EUR19,949,023programme,\\n       delivering infrastructures for exascale technology - deployed by 15 international application\\n       teams in climate/weather, physics/energy, and life-science/bioinformatics.\\n    \\uf0b7  Japan AIST: We maintain a partnership with the Japanese National Institute of Advanced\\n       Industrial Science & Technology (AIST). Funding (donated by AIST) enables extended visits\\n       by Cangelosi/Ananiadou, and PGRs/PDRAs (total 50-person months). In 2017-20 this\\n       enabled 16 published articles.\\n                                                                                               Page 22\\n\\n\\n4.ii) Developing Relationships with Research Users\\nFostering our interfaces for impact (1.iii) provides a base of long-standing industrial partners. These\\nare exploited by ECR academics, who regularly partner with established staff as mentors to “bring\\nthem on-board” (Principle 4: Responsibility, our open and collegiate culture). New partnerships are\\nalso enabled by sabbatical/secondment policies (2.iv), for example, Kotselidis extended a sabbatical\\nat KTM A.G. Ltd into a part-time industrial appointment (3.v), enabling the H2020 ELEGANT project\\n(EUR4,983,250) on secure vehicle communications.\\nWe provide examples where the virtuous circle (1.ii) has enriched our environment: materially\\n(via inward investment) and intellectually (driving new cross-theme research directions), e.g.:\\nAstraZeneca. Senior staff member, Brass, introduced an AstraZeneca contact to a then junior staff\\nmember (Brown), leading to a fruitful reciprocal research collaboration. This was supported by Unit-\\nfunded visits, and 2 PhD co-supervisions (2014-15), leading to an AstraZeneca investment of\\nGBP400,000 (2016) to support Brown (A.I. theme) and Jay (Human Centred Computing). Outcomes:\\nMethods for statistical biomarker selection, with a user-informed and co-designed visualisation, now\\nbeing integrated into AstraZeneca workflows.\\nBBC Research & Development. In 2017, UoM started a 5-year Partnership with BBC R&D. The\\nUnit funded initial interactions – enabling a funded project (EP/M017133/1), and a PGR internship.\\nThis stimulated institutional investment of GBP22,000 (2016, matched by BBC) to create a\\nuniversity-wide network fostering interdisciplinary data science. We authored a White Paper,\\n‘Challenges/Opportunities in Data Science’ (now a standard BBC reference), and embedded PDRAs\\ninto BBC labs. This led to a BBC investment of GBP380,000, enabling 5 internships and 3 iCASEs.\\nARM Ltd. A long-term relationship enables access to ARM IP. Exemplar outputs include the\\nSpiNNaker architecture, and a 28nm System-on-Chip architecture (EuroEXA). In 2018 we were\\nawarded the ARM Centre of Excellence status, providing a recurring donation (GBP50,000 p.a.) to\\nsupport activities. This supports ECRs in establishing career directions (e.g. Pop, Cordeiro, Pavlidis).\\n4.iii) Wider contributions to the Economy and Society\\nTranslational research in text mining of MP enquiries. As a Parliamentary Fellow, Batista has\\ncontributed to Government efficiency – the research is being deployed in the House of Commons\\nLibrary to accelerate searching 600,000 historical MP enquiries.\\nWe helped define the national curriculum.

      "[\"University of Sheffield\\n Unit of Assessment: B-11 Computer Science and Informatics\\n 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n1.1 Overview\\nThe Department of Computer Science is committed to advancing the theoretical foundations of\\ncomputer science and to achieving impact through close collaboration with end users. Our focus\\non interdisciplinary research is distinctive: much of our most impactful work arises from research at\\nthe boundaries between computer science and other disciplines. We play a central role in the\\nUniversity research environment, providing leadership for six interdisciplinary centres and flagship\\ninstitutes.\\nOur vision is to address major challenges within four themes: speech and language, healthcare\\ntechnologies, bioinspired machine intelligence, and dependable and secure systems. Our\\nstrategy is to develop a large cohort of excellent researchers that exhibit breadth as well as depth,\\nenabling us to forge international collaborations that advance the discipline and create real-world\\nimpact. Work across our four themes spans novel contributions to the theoretical foundations of the\\ndiscipline through to the translation of our research into applications used by thousands of people.\\nResearch activity is supported by substantial investment in computing facilities and infrastructure,\\nincluding a planned £10.5m refurbishment of our accommodation.\\nKey achievements since REF2014 include:\\n    ●    Growth in academic staff from 33 to 55, with a 100% increase in the number of female\\n         academics and 67% growth in international academic staff.\\n    ●    Publications in top computer science (e.g. ACM, IEEE, TCS, NeurIPS) and interdisciplinary\\n         (e.g. Nature Communications, Nature Neuroscience, PNAS) venues.\\n    ●    £32.5m in research income, a 73% increase from REF2014.\\n    ●    Growth in industrial income from £875k to £2.1m, including two new industry-funded\\n         research centres supported by £1.4m to date.\\n    ●    New groups in Algorithms and Security of Advanced Systems, the latter with a £1.2m\\n         strategic investment from the University.\\n    ●    Growth in the PhD student population of 20%, with sustainability ensured through the\\n         award of a £5.2m UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) award, further supported by\\n         £2.2m in industry-funded studentships.\\n    ●    A successful impact pipeline that has produced three spin-out companies, informed\\n         UNESCO’s COVID-19 response and added $120m to the value of a major Silicon Valley\\n         speech technology company.\\nWe take great pride in being a collegial, supportive research community, one in which equality,\\ndiversity and inclusion (EDI) are core values. The Department was awarded an Athena SWAN\\nSilver award in 2016. Through an ongoing action plan, we are committed to advancing EDI in the\\ndiscipline through local, national, and international initiatives.\\n                                                                                               Page 1\\n\\n\\n1.2 Unit structure, research strategy and progress towards REF2014 objectives\\nOur research strategy focuses on key questions and major challenges associated with our four\\nthemes. Research in each theme is supported by a cluster of research groups, each of which is led\\nby a senior academic (Figure 1). Every theme addresses both fundamental research and\\nengineering applications. Academic membership in these research groups is not exclusive; many\\nresearchers contribute to the activities of more than one group, and groups contribute to more than\\none theme.\\nThe Department sits within the Faculty of Engineering. All groups are supported by specialist\\nlaboratory facilities, interdisciplinary facilities provided by the Faculty, and University-level high-\\nperformance computing (HPC). Our Research Software Engineering (RSE) group provides\\nexpertise on HPC within the Department and across the whole University.\\nIn REF2014 we set out an ambitious plan for expansion, aiming to develop areas of existing\\nstrength (speech and language technologies, machine learning (ML), healthcare technologies) and\\ngrow our expertise in algorithms. Implementation of our REF2014 plans was further informed by a\\nstrategic review in 2015/16, which recommended that new groups be established in Algorithms and\\nSecurity of Advanced Systems. The outcome over the assessment period has been a significant\\nstrengthening of our research across all four themes, as outlined below.\\n                        Figure 1: Key strategic themes, structure, and collaborations\\nSpeech and language\\nA major challenge for spoken language technology (SLT) is to develop conversational agents that\\ncan engage in human-like dialogues: this requires a deep understanding of spoken language\\nbehaviour and robustness to the presence of multiple talkers. Explainability, trustworthiness and\\nelimination of bias in SLT systems are also fundamental concerns.\\nWe address these challenges through one of the strongest concentrations of SLT researchers in\\nacademia worldwide, comprising 18 academics from our Natural Language Processing (NLP) and\\nSpeech and Hearing (SPandH) groups (8 professors, 9 lecturers/ senior lecturers, 1 fellow). The\\ncluster is unique in its ability to conduct research across a broad spectrum, from computational\\nmodels of language and human hearing, to commercially deployed automatic speech recognition\\n(ASR) and text engineering systems.\\n                                                                                                    Page 2\\n\\n\\nOur success in addressing the challenges of this theme is illustrated by influential publications.\\nWork on noise-robust ASR includes an approach to using multiple microphones cited in Google\\npatents (Hain ICASSP), and papers on the CHiME challenges for distant microphone ASR that\\nhave received over 1,000 citations (Barker, Computer Speech & Language). Papers published in\\ntop NLP venues cover social media analysis (Aletras, ACL), metaphor identification (Lin, ACL),\\nidiomaticity detection (Villavicencio, ACL) and the evaluation of neural sentence encoders\\n(Barrault, EMNLP). The latter has been cited over 1100 times and inspired the widely used GLUE\\nbenchmark. A study on predicting judicial decisions (Aletras, PeerJ CS) has received over 300\\ncitations since 2016.\\nThis theme was supported by funding awards totalling £16.3m. Additionally, we have ensured\\nfuture sustainability through a £5.2m UKRI CDT award in Speech and Language Technologies,\\nmatched by £2.2m of industry sponsorship from Apple, Amazon, 3M and others. Three impact\\ncase studies have emerged from this theme. The Silicon Valley company VoiceBase established a\\ncentre to support Hain’s world-leading research on ASR (£500k p.a.). Machine translation research\\nhas been supported by a prestigious £1.2m ERC starting grant (Specia) and has informed\\ntechnology used by Facebook and Microsoft. Text engineering for social media analysis\\n(Bontcheva) has been an outstanding success, attracting nearly £4m of grant funding and being\\nused by Buzzfeed and Nesta.\\nMoving forward, a particular focus will be on SLT for low-resource languages and sparse data\\ndomains that are poorly served by current deep learning methods. We plan to establish a centre of\\nexcellence in NLP for computational social science.\\nHealthcare technologies\\nResearch in this theme is driven by the complexity of the clinical setting, aligned with challenges in\\nharnessing technology to deliver healthcare more effectively. We focus on computational models\\nas tools to identify causal relationships in disease mechanisms. Key challenges include maximising\\nthe information gained from images and measurements, developing personalised models to\\nimprove diagnosis and target therapy, monitoring disease progression via data analytics, and\\ntranslating these tools into routine use.\\nThis theme is primarily supported by our Organisations, Information and Knowledge (OAK) and\\nComplex Systems Modelling (CSM) groups, with input from the ML group. Fifteen academics\\ncontribute to the theme (5 professors, 10 lecturers/ senior lecturers). It is further supported by a\\nnetwork of clinical and interdisciplinary collaborations provided by Insigneo (the Institute for in silico\\nMedicine), the Centre for Assistive Technology and Connected Healthcare (CATCH), the Sheffield\\nInstitute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN) and the flagship Neuroscience and Healthy\\nLifespan Institutes.\\nContributions to basic science and optimising therapy include insight into the mechanisms of\\nwound healing from multiscale models of cells and tissue (Walker, J Roy Soc Interface), novel\\npersonalised models of the heart (Clayton, Phil Trans Roy Soc A), and models and risk\\nstratification of intracranial aneurysms (Watton, Biomech and Model Mechanobiol). Examples of\\nresearch translation include the integration of Watton’s aneurysm growth model into the ITIS\\n(Switzerland) SIM4LIFE software and clinical testing of a speech analytics system for the detection\\nof cognitive decline (Christensen). Data analytics approaches have been used to understand\\npatient trajectories through the NHS (PathAnalyse, funded by the Health Foundation and deployed\\nin Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, Villa-Uriol) and to quantify physical activity in the community\\nsetting via a smartphone app (Large-Scale Data case study, over 1m downloads by 2019).\\n                                                                                                  Page 3\\n\\n\\nGrants totalling £5m were secured from funders including BBSRC, British Heart Foundation, the\\nEU, NIHR, the Health Foundation, Rosetrees Trust, Wellcome Trust, Amazon and EPSRC. Many\\ngrants are collaborations between academic and clinical partners in the UK and internationally, as\\nwell as industrial partners, e.g. we are partners in the €10.3m PRIMAGE Horizon 2020 project.\\nOur future research focus will be on leveraging our expertise in ML in areas such as uncertainty\\nquantification for personalised disease models and medical image analysis.\\nBioinspired machine intelligence\\nResearch is driven by the design of energy-efficient algorithms that learn from fewer data, and\\nyield solutions that are interpretable and explainable. We tackle these challenges through\\nfundamental research mainly inspired by biological organisms.\\nThis theme is supported by 14 academics (3 professors, 11 lecturers/ senior lecturers) across the\\nML, CSM, Visual Computing and Algorithms groups and makes a substantial contribution to\\nSheffield Robotics (Prescott is the Director). Research spans fundamental theory on graph\\nnetworks, genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning to applications, e.g. in cognitive robotics.\\nHighlights include work on graph clustering (Peng, STOC) described as “breakthrough” by ACM\\nFellow Sanjeev Khanna, work on graph convolutional networks (Lu, CIKM) that outperforms state-\\nof-the-art models, and a novel energy-based formulation of learning for spiking neural networks\\n(Gilra, ICML; e-Life). Models of insect navigation and learning (Marshall, Mangan, Vasilaki, PLOS\\nComputational Biology) and their applications in robotics have provided the intellectual foundation\\nfor a spin-out company, Opteran. Alvarez’s work on data-efficient latent force models for\\nreinforcement learning (IEEE TAC) led to EPSRC funding on “one-shot learning”. Oliveto and\\nSudholt’s runtime analysis of genetic algorithms won a GECCO’14 best paper award.\\nThe theme is supported by grants totalling £8.6m, including funding from Amazon (Lu) and Google\\n(Vasilaki). Examples include the £1.2m ActiveAI EPSRC Centre-to-Centre grant (Mangan), which\\nestablishes a long-term research partnership with leading teams in Australia, and the £2m Brain on\\nBoards programme grant (Marshall). Vasilaki has secured three grants for her work on\\nneuromorphic engineering, forging links with the Department of Materials Science and Engineering\\n(EPSRC and Leverhulme, £1.8m). Oliveto obtained an EPSRC Early Career Fellowship (£1.2m).\\nPrescott collaborates internationally via the Human Brain Project (£0.7m).\\nA particular focus of future research will be the development of explainable AI. Gilra and Vasilaki\\nrecently secured a CHIST-ERA grant addressing causal explanations in reinforcement learning,\\nand Alvarez is developing methods for learning cause-effect models from large datasets. Lu will\\nfocus on interpretable ML for data-scarce domains. We will expand our work on bioinspired robotic\\nvision (Sun), supported by additional staff recruitment.\\nDependable and secure systems\\nResearch is driven by the challenge of developing systems that are demonstrably dependable and\\nsecure. Key problems relate to concurrent systems, for which correctness is tightly coupled to\\narchitecture. Hybrid systems, which combine discrete and continuous data, provide particular\\nchallenges for smart manufacturing and autonomous systems. Ensuring privacy in modern\\nadvanced systems is also an important issue.\\nThe theme is supported by 18 staff (5 professors, 12 lecturers/ senior lecturers, 1 fellow) across\\nthe Algorithms, Testing, Verification and Security groups, including four of the most senior UK\\n                                                                                               Page 4\\n\\n\\nacademics working in the field (Derrick, Hierons, Struth, Clark). Research income was £6.5m,\\nincluding grants from the EPSRC, EU, Dstl, Google and Facebook.\\nHighlights include significant contributions to concurrency theory, including\\ncompleteness/decidability for concurrent Kleene algebras (Struth, LIPIcs), decidability/complexity\\nfor distributed testing (Hierons, IEEE ToC), and notions of correctness and complexity for weak\\nmemory (Derrick, ACM TOCL). We developed authentication protocols (Gope, IEEE TIFS), ciphers\\n(Kavun, CRYPTO), and access control methods (Kaaniche, IEEE TCC) for resource-constrained\\narchitectures and novel techniques in distributed testing (Hierons, ACM TOSEM) and verification in\\nthe presence of transactional memory (Derrick, several EPSRC projects in collaboration with\\nARM). We addressed compositionality to enable scalability (Hierons, EPSRC RoboTest) and the\\ntesting of highly concurrent Erlang code (Derrick, EU PROWESS). We advanced automation\\nthrough work on automated reasoning (Struth, FAOC), the theoretical basis for model checking\\n(Ordyniak, FOCS) and theorem-provers applied to verify the security of real-world applications\\n(Popescu, POPL). We use metaheuristics such as genetic algorithms (e.g., Clark, Journal Syst.\\nSoft.; McMinn, ACM TOSEM) and are one of the few groups to provide theoretical results\\nregarding the effectiveness of these techniques (e.g. Oliveto, TCS).\\nFuture plans include exploring the quantitative verification and testing of probabilistic systems,\\nsupported by the UKRI Verifiability Node and EPSRC RoboTest project (Hierons). We will further\\ndevelop verification and testing techniques for transactional and non-volatile memory (Derrick).\\nEPSRC-funded work on causal inference (Walkinshaw, CiTCOM) provides a starting point for\\naddressing large-scale systems. Finally, we will investigate how AI can be exploited for defence\\nand attack (Clark, Gope and Kaaniche).\\n1.3 Approach to supporting interdisciplinary research\\nThrough our strategic themes, we carry out research in areas that are interdisciplinary by nature,\\nand seek impact through partnerships with other domains. Speech and Language draws on\\nphonetics, linguistics, psychophysics and engineering but also contributes to these disciplines (e.g.\\ncomputational models of hearing, NLP methods in corpus linguistics). Healthcare Technology and\\nBioinspired Machine Intelligence are entirely interdisciplinary themes, in which close collaboration\\nwith other research areas (particularly medicine and biological sciences) is key. Approximately\\n60% of our outputs and 35% of our grants involve collaborations with departments such as\\nBiological Sciences, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology, Physics, and Law.\\nWe identify key interdisciplinary areas based on research strength and sustainability and support\\nthem through the following mechanisms:\\nStrategic leadership of interdisciplinary University institutes and centres. We hold leadership\\npositions in: Insigneo (Clayton); Sheffield Robotics (Prescott); and CATCH (Christensen) as well as\\nin three of the four University Flagship Research Institutes - Neuroscience (Vasilaki, Gilra), Healthy\\nLifespan (Villavicencio, Villa-Uriol), Sustainable Food (Cunningham). These facilitate our\\ninvolvement in large collaborative grants, e.g. the €15m SANO centre for personalised medicine,\\nand lead to interdisciplinary outputs (e.g. Current Biology), and position papers in influential\\njournals (e.g. Nature Food). We nurture future leaders of interdisciplinary research through early\\nengagement with leadership (e.g. Gilra, Villa-Uriol and Christensen held roles in institutes as\\nlecturers), supported by schemes such as Sheffield Leader (Section 2.3).\\nAppointments in interdisciplinary areas. We recruit researchers with demonstrable ability to\\nwork across disciplinary boundaries. Appointments have cemented our links with Neuroscience\\n(Alvarez, Gilra, Mangan, Wang), Neurology (Christensen), the NHS (Lanfranchi, Villa-Uriol),\\n                                                                                                 Page 5\\n\\n\\nCardiology (Lu) and Psychology (Prescott). Outcomes include interdisciplinary publications in top\\nvenues (e.g. Nature Neuroscience) and £3.15m in collaborative grants.\\nInternal funding to support interdisciplinary research. We invested £800k in interdisciplinary\\nPhD studentships, and co-supervise students with 11 other departments. We organise events that\\ncatalyse interdisciplinary collaborations, e.g. an ML workshop for the Faculty of Science. Resulting\\noutcomes include papers co-authored by PhD students in prestigious outlets (e.g. Nature Machine\\nIntelligence) and new collaborations with the Department of Chemistry. We also fund infrastructure\\nfor interdisciplinary research (Section 3).\\nResearch software engineering (RSE). We support a rapidly growing RSE group by underwriting\\n6 posts, an investment of £90k since 2014. The group underpins excellence in research software\\nacross the University: in 2019/20, it supported 28 grants, with a total value exceeding £9m. In turn,\\nthis leads to interdisciplinary collaborations: Richmond (head of RSE) holds interdisciplinary grants\\ntotalling £1.4m, including projects on bone disease and tuberculosis vaccine development.\\nOur future strategy includes investment in these successful mechanisms and capitalising on our\\nstrategic involvement in interdisciplinary institutes, which will benefit from the University’s recent\\ncommitment to invest £13.7m in four flagship research institutes. We have leadership positions in\\nthree of these and are forging links with the fourth (Energy) via our new appointment Gope.\\n1.4 Impact strategy, support mechanisms and outcomes\\nOur impact strategy promotes early engagement with end users of our research across each of our\\nfour strategic themes to ensure that impact is embedded from project conception to dissemination.\\nThe identification and development of impact opportunities are supported by an impact champion\\n(Cunningham), Faculty and University research support services, and the following mechanisms:\\nJoint appointments. These bridge us with key targets for translating research. Lanfranchi has a\\njoint appointment with the NHS, securing more than £400k in health-related grants in the last two\\nyears. Law’s appointment with the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) led to the\\ninvolvement of the AMRC in a UKRI TAS Verifiability Node.\\nVisiting academic appointments. Six industry figures facilitate connections that support research\\nimpact. Collaboration with visiting academic Chakravarthy (Dstl) led to the foundation of a new\\nUniversity Technology Centre for AI in Defence and Security.\\nConsultancy. Generous consulting and shared IP arrangements encourage staff to undertake\\nconsultancy that can lead to larger impact opportunities. Since REF2014, consultancy income\\nexceeded £1.4m, involving 13 staff and 39 partners. These partners include SMEs such as\\nElephant Gin (Law) and Alchemy Machines (Aletras) and large companies such as Samsung\\n(Ragni). The Large-Scale Data impact case study arose from consultancy contracts with Public\\nHealth England (to develop the “Active 10” app) and JustGiving.\\nWe proactively identify impactful research and support it via reduced workloads and impact\\nsabbaticals. Professional knowledge exchange colleagues assist industry engagement, both in the\\nFaculty (2 FTE) and in a central impact and knowledge exchange team (13.2 FTE). From the latter,\\nwe received Impact Accelerator Account, HEIF and Commercialisation of IP funds of £311k in the\\nassessment period. Our RSE group is deployed to accelerate impact, supporting, e.g. our case\\nstudy Combatting Disinformation by rapid delivery of an online COVID-19 disinformation\\ndashboard.\\n                                                                                                   Page 6\\n\\n\\n                                        Figure 2: Impact pipeline\\nOur successful impact strategy is apparent from the quality and diversity of our selected case\\nstudies, which range from influential research informing policymakers (Banning LAWS, Combating\\nDisinformation) to speech and language research that underpins the technology of VoiceBase,\\nFacebook and Microsoft (Automatic Voice Recognition, Machine Translation), and research on\\nanalysing data at massive scales, which has impacted hundreds of thousands of people (Large-\\nScale Data). Our successful impact pipeline is evidenced by many projects at various stages of\\ntranslation, e.g. working with South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, we used the\\nopen-source GATE text engineering technology developed in our speech and language theme to\\nfind a link between symptoms of schizophrenia described in a patient’s clinical records and the\\nlikelihood of that patient being admitted to a hospital. In our bioinspired machine intelligence\\ntheme, fundamental research on the visual system of the honeybee has been translated via\\nOpteran (Marshall). The company is pioneering bioinspired silicon-based solutions for computer\\nvision and autonomous decision making and has raised £2.1m in seed funding.\\nExisting case studies and new projects in our impact pipeline will provide the starting point for\\ndeveloping our future impact agenda. Our centres funded by VoiceBase and Dstl will be crucibles\\nfor translational research, further feeding our impact pipeline. Our impactful work on misinformation\\nwill be supported by additional academic appointments.\\n1.5 Open research and research integrity\\nResearch integrity is a fundamental component of research excellence. We uphold principles of\\nhonesty, responsibility, fairness and accountability, supported by commitment from the institution,\\nour staff and postgraduate research (PGR) students. Our strategy for developing open research\\nand research integrity is based around the following three pillars:\\nDeveloping a culture of research integrity. We adopt an approach to research that is\\nunderpinned by honesty and transparency and supported by rigorous methods and reporting\\nprinciples. Training is a key factor in achieving this. All PGR students and new staff complete a\\ncourse on Professional Behaviour and Ethical Conduct. We run an annual seminar on peer review,\\ntargeted at PGR students and postdoctoral research assistants (PDRAs). All staff and PGR\\nstudents complete online training in unconscious bias and protecting research data. We ensure\\nthat informed, auditable oversight of research integrity occurs in practice. Ethics, data governance\\nand research methodology are considered at all PGR progression/review points and in\\nprobationary staff reviews. We maintain a panel of trained ethics reviewers, supported by a\\nbespoke online ethics approval system. Audits of our ethical approvals are undertaken by the\\nUniversity Research Ethics Committee. Declarations of interest are systematically reviewed and\\n                                                                                                 Page 7\\n\\n\\nupdated annually. Faculty approval is required for the appointment of PGR examiners, with due\\nregard to appropriate competence and independence. Finally, we seek to establish a culture in\\nwhich concerns about research integrity can be raised without fear of reprisal. A procedure for\\nwhistleblowing is outlined (see REF5a); however, we emphasise that honesty is paramount.\\nSupport for open access (OA). We ensure that publicly funded research is accessible to the\\npublic, industry, and the wider academic community, and we adhere to University-wide principles\\nof OA. To ensure maximum discoverability of our research, we aim to put all outputs in White Rose\\nResearch Online, our shared repository with Leeds and York (green route). The 1,463 outputs\\ndeposited over the assessment period were downloaded over 99,000 times. This is our preferred\\nroute, ensuring equity in publishing opportunities regardless of available funding; we also publish\\noutputs in fully OA journals, supported by a Departmental fund, or hybrid where required for funder\\ncompliance. In addition, staff increasingly submit papers to preprint services such as arXiv to\\nensure timely dissemination of research findings. Twenty staff have editorial roles in journals that\\nsupport open research.\\nSupport for open data, open methods and open-source software. This support is the core of\\nreproducibility, being intimately linked to the culture of research integrity we seek. We publish\\nsoftware and datasets to the community through our institutional data repository, ORDA. The\\nspeech and language theme has been particularly active in sharing open data, including the\\nLombard Grid, an audiovisual speech corpus, and CHiME, a series of ASR challenges. Our RSE\\ngroup supports a doctoral training module on software methodologies and tools, underpinning our\\ncommitment to the reproducibility of results. We promote open training to the community, e.g. the\\nannual Gaussian Process Summer School (Lawrence, Alvarez, Smith) is a beacon of the open\\napproach to research training. The related GPy open-source framework for Gaussian Processes is\\ndistributed through GitHub, with 431 users and 64 contributors.\\nGoing forward, our strategy is to recognise and promote methodological excellence within our\\nresearch, e.g. by leveraging our capacity in RSE to support and educate staff and PGR students in\\nopen research software. We will develop short courses in open data and software for research\\nlocally and then make them available to the whole University as a beacon activity; Derrick’s\\nexperience as chair of the University OA Advisory Group will facilitate this. We will also promote\\nawareness of the ethical requirements and practices of other disciplines. Lanfranchi is our ethics\\nlead and has a joint position with the NHS; she is well positioned to advise on research integrity\\nwithin the healthcare technologies theme, which increasingly involves clinical collaboration.\\n1.6 Strategic priorities for the next five years\\nOur ongoing strategy is to capitalise on our excellence and to grow our investment around our four\\nkey themes. Priorities in the next five years are as follows:\\nFurther develop collaborations in our strategic themes. Collaborations allow us to better\\nunderstand challenges and act as vehicles for a broad range of impact. These collaborations will\\nbe facilitated by further growing our academic staff to 73 to enable theme, institute and end-user\\ncollaborations while maintaining a balanced growth across the four themes. Our first priority is to\\nincrease our capacity in machine vision, which will provide new opportunities for interaction with\\nInsigneo, CATCH and Sheffield Robotics. Collaborations benefit from Sheffield’s commitment to\\ninvest £13.7m in four flagship research institutes, all of which we are linked to. Finally, we will\\nenhance collaborations with the AMRC and High Value Manufacturing Catapult through our\\ndependable and secure systems theme.\\n                                                                                                 Page 8\\n\\n\\nExploit and contribute to wider infrastructure and services. Significant opportunities for\\nleveraging infrastructure in areas of Sheffield’s strengths are the £43m Industry 4.0 investment in\\nthe AMRC and the HPC provision at the Faculty, University and national levels. IT infrastructure\\nwill benefit from a £10m University investment. A key aim will be to grow our HPC infrastructure at\\nthe scale necessary to support our research in ML. To address this, we will seek collaborations\\nwith other academic institutions and commercial cloud computing providers.\\nRevitalise and exploit our physical infrastructure. We plan to be in extended and refurbished\\naccommodation by the end of 2022, enabled by University investment of £10.5m. We will use this\\nopportunity to re-equip our groups, stimulate cross-group research and enhance the PGR student\\nenvironment. Our refurbished building will offer an improved environment for knowledge exchange\\nand external engagement, facilitating our future impact strategy, which stresses early and close\\nengagement with business, the public and the third sector.\\n  2. People\\n2.1 Overview\\nOur REF2014 plans have led to significant, strategic growth within our key themes. The\\nDepartment now has 55 academic staff, 2 academic fellows, 72 researchers; among those 2\\nacademic fellows, 6 University teachers, 39 professional support staff, and 86 PGR students of\\nwhich 53 are Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs). Each theme is supported by a mixture of\\nsenior research leaders, mid-career staff and early-career researchers (ECRs) with an excellent\\ntrajectory.\\nWe take great pride in fostering a friendly, collegial and nurturing research environment. Our\\napproach to staffing and recruitment is informed by deeply held EDI values, recognised through a\\nSilver Athena SWAN award. The University is in the top 100 of the Sunday Times Best Employers\\nList, is a Top 5% Stonewall employer and maintains an HR Excellence in Research Award and\\nDisability Confident accreditation.\\n2.2 Staffing and recruitment strategy\\nOur staffing and recruitment strategy ensures that we have the breadth and depth of research\\nexcellence needed to address our research themes. Challenges have been to appoint outstanding\\nindividuals in competitive areas (e.g. cybersecurity, ML) and to attract senior academics to\\nestablish new groups and strengthen the leadership of existing groups.\\n                                                                                              Page 9\\n\\n\\n                          Figure 3: People, staffing and recruitment strategy\\nWe achieve these aims in two ways. Firstly, we develop a distinctive five-year support package for\\nECRs, in the form of internally-funded proleptic fellowships. These offer guaranteed progression to\\nan open-ended academic position, subject to meeting standard probation requirements. Secondly,\\nwe support new lecturers and professors with an attractive package including internally-funded\\nPGR studentships and a reduced teaching load for 2-3 years.\\nThis strategy has been successful in attracting outstanding talent. Over the assessment period, we\\nappointed 2 fellows (1 female), 17 lecturers (5 female), 7 senior lecturers (1 female) and four\\nprofessors (1 female). These contribute to the excellence of our research themes as follows:\\nSpeech and language. Research in multilinguality and cognitively motivated NLP was supported\\nby the appointment of Villavicencio to a personal chair. Three senior lecturers (Goetze, Barrault,\\nLin) bring expertise in deep learning methods. Lectureship appointments Ragni and Aletras have\\nprogressed rapidly, the latter winning £508k in grant income since appointment. We deployed an\\ninternally-funded fellowship to recruit Scarton in the competitive area of machine translation. She\\nhas already won a major grant (EPSRC £446k).\\nHealthcare technologies. We recruited Lanfranchi to a joint position with the NHS: she has\\nsecured £547k in grants since appointment, many with clinical partners. Villa-Uriol and Yang bring\\nphysiological modelling and machine learning expertise, cementing our links with Insigneo. Wang\\nis a joint appointment with Neuroscience and SITraN, bringing expertise in bioinformatics.\\nChristensen has developed extensive clinical collaborations through work on the assessment of\\nneurodegenerative disorders (Journal of Neurology) and secured an EU Marie Skłodowska-Curie\\nTraining Network (TAPAS).\\nBioinspired machine intelligence. Prescott was recruited to a chair to grow links with Sheffield\\nRobotics, where he is the Director. Lecturers Mangan and Sun bring expertise in bioinspired\\nrobotics and machine vision. Research in core ML methods was strengthened through Alvarez and\\nLu, who have earned £839k between them in grants, with both securing an EPSRC New\\nInvestigator Award. Expertise in graph clustering was strengthened by Peng, who publishes in the\\ncompetitive SODA conference. Gilra’s work on recurrent spiking neural networks (eLife) cements\\nour links with the flagship Neuroscience Institute. A proleptic fellowship was used to attract Smith,\\nwhose work on ML methods for pollution modelling is likely to become a future impact case study.\\nDependable and secure systems. Clark was recruited to lead our new Security group, supported\\nby strategic University investment of £1.2m. The group now comprises 5 academics, 3 PDRAs and\\n10 PGR students. Appointments in the Security group bring expertise in cryptographic algorithms\\n(Kavun, Kaaniche), information flow security (Popescu) and internet-of-things (IoT) security\\n(Gope). Our expertise in model checking was bolstered by Ordyniak, who publishes in top venues\\n(e.g. Algorithmica). Leadership in testing was supported through the chair appointment of Hierons;\\n                                                                                               Page 10\\n\\n\\nwith new senior lecturer Walkinshaw he has won an EPSRC grant on causal inference for testing\\ncomputational models. Capacity in verification was increased by Beohar and Dimitrova, the latter\\nhaving expertise in hybrid systems and potential links with the AMRC.\\nAll Category A staff are on open-ended contracts. We offer open-ended contracts to researchers\\non fixed-term projects wherever appropriate, taking account of longer-term strategy and plans.\\nCurrently 35% of researchers are on open-ended contracts (up from 24% in the last period).\\nGoing forward, a plan has been developed with Faculty approval to grow our academic staff to 73\\nwithin 6 years. We will recruit a chair and two further lecturers in machine vision, supporting our\\nbioinspired machine intelligence and healthcare technologies themes. The dependable and secure\\nsystems theme will be strengthened by a chair and two lectureships in distributed systems and an\\nadditional lectureship in security. An internally-funded fellowship will support the pipeline of\\nresearchers working on social media analysis in the speech and language theme.\\n2.3 Staff development and support\\nOur strategy is to provide support that enables high performance, agility, leadership, and\\nintellectual and professional development. During the assessment period, a particular focus has\\nbeen to support the progression of fellows to academic positions and to ensure that new\\nappointees and ECRs become well-embedded in the unit and rapidly progress.\\nThe University’s Academic Career Pathways (ACP) framework provides a structure for academic\\nstaff progression from early career to professorship. Research and impact are explicitly recognised\\nwithin the ACP framework, with appropriate expectations set to enable achievement to be\\nrewarded in terms of progression. All staff have an annual review meeting that focuses on career\\nplanning and identifies ongoing training needs. Strong staff engagement with this process exists in\\nthe Department (e.g. 97% of staff completed a review in 2019).\\nSupporting fellowships. Faculty professional services provide support by arranging mock\\ninterview panels, and workloads are adjusted for those developing fellowship applications. In the\\nassessment period, seven of our staff held fellowships, three of which were ECRs (see below).\\nBontcheva won an EPSRC Career Acceleration Fellowship while working part-time, and Specia\\nwas awarded an ERC starting grant. In both cases, the fellowships supported work that led to an\\nimpact case study. Marshall was awarded an ERC Consolidator grant and Clark held a Royal\\nSociety Wolfson Research Merit Award.\\nSupporting the development of ECRs and PDRAs. We proactively mentor our ECRs to ensure\\ntheir retention and career progression, with close involvement of the Head of Department (HoD).\\nThe success of this approach is exemplified by Oliveto and Richmond, who were initially supported\\nby Sheffield Vice-Chancellor Fellowships. Both were subsequently appointed to senior lecturer and\\nwon EPSRC Early Career and RSE Fellowships respectively. Croucher won a second RSE\\nFellowship and progressed to Head of Research Computing at the University of Leeds. An\\nextensive range of development modules is available to PDRAs, including courses on\\nentrepreneurship, research management, academic writing and media training. A professor and\\nEPSRC panel chair (Clark) runs a proposal-writing training module for ECRs and PDRAs.\\nImplementing the Concordat to support the career development of researchers. We have\\nmapped our activities against the Concordat and implement its principles through an induction\\nprogramme, annual reviews and away days for researchers. The latter covers topics such as\\nindustry engagement, frequently with an invited speaker. The “Think Ahead” development\\n                                                                                                 Page 11\\n\\n\\nprogramme, coordinated by a dedicated member of the University’s professional services team,\\nfurther promotes employment and professional development opportunities.\\nSupporting probationary staff. Probationary staff have a reduced teaching load for three years\\n(set as 50%, 70%, and 90% of normal load). New appointees have a mentor and devise a\\nprobation plan with the HoD. They meet monthly with the HoD/Deputy HoD during the probation\\nperiod. This close mentoring approach is successful: all 10 staff who completed probation\\nexceeded their grant income target of £130k, with a mean grant income of £344k. Half of these\\nstaff completed probation a year early.\\nDeveloping future leaders. Research groups are typically led by a professor. In some cases\\ngroup heads are new senior appointments (Clark, Hierons), but in most cases future leaders are\\ndeveloped from existing staff (e.g. Bontcheva, Hain), with a succession pipeline supported by\\ndepartmental mentors or institutional programmes such as Sheffield Leader. Twenty-six staff\\nparticipated in these programmes (11 female, 15 male) and have gone on to assume major\\nleadership roles within the Department (e.g. group heads, HoD, Director of Research) and in the\\nwider University (Christensen is Faculty Director of EDI; Derrick is Vice President for the Faculty of\\nScience).\\n2.4 Support and reward for research and impact\\nResearch and impact are rewarded through the ACP framework, which sets out transparent\\nexpectations to achieve career progression. In the assessment period 23 staff were promoted,\\nincluding 6 to personal chairs (3 women), which reflects the high quality of our staff, our robust\\nprocesses for supporting career progression, and our readiness to recognise and reward\\nachievement in research as well as broader contributions in leadership, professional standing and\\nwider engagement.\\nSabbaticals allow one semester of leave after seven and are allocated according to a rolling\\nschedule, looking several years ahead. Part-time staff take study leave on a pro-rata basis.\\nNotable outcomes of 15 sabbaticals in the assessment period include the following: McMinn\\ndeveloped a new relationship with Facebook, leading to a £41k grant on search-based testing;\\nSudholt published four journal papers (Artificial Intelligence, Algorithmica, IEEE TEC) and four\\nconference papers (GECCO); Prescott visited the Sage Centre for the Study of the Mind at the\\nUniversity of California Santa Barbara as Distinguished Fellow, leading to a co-authored article\\n(Trends in Neuroscience); and Hain visited the Nagoya Institute of Technology as Visiting\\nProfessor, leading to a student exchange and collaboration on a grant proposal. We also fund\\nshorter research visits that are likely to lead to high-quality outputs, e.g. Struth’s visit to Macquarie\\nUniversity and Data61 in Sydney led to two collaborative papers on quantitative information flow.\\nWe keep teaching and administrative loads in balance through a workload allocation model so that\\ntime for research and impact is protected. We also support research through spending on\\nteaching-specialist staff; since 2014, we have appointed 6 university teachers (two were funded\\nthrough a £1m Institute of Coding grant) and increased spending on GTAs from £31k in 2014/15 to\\n£90k in 2019/20.\\n2.5 Support for postgraduate research students\\nOur strategy is to create a diverse community of PGR students with a broad range of specialist\\nskills and intellectual perspectives. We aim to attract the brightest PGR students from the UK and\\ninternationally, driving recruitment with internally-funded scholarships (£3m over the assessment\\nperiod) and through our CDT, which will sponsor 60 PGRs over 2019-2027. We attract diverse\\n                                                                                                  Page 12\\n\\n\\ncandidates by advertising widely and support self-funded applicants where possible (e.g. via partial\\nfee scholarships). Our success is evidenced by a diverse cohort (13% EU and 59% international\\nrepresenting 38 countries) and PGRs with first-authored papers in top journals (e.g. Paetzold,\\nJournal of AI Research; Mirheidari, Computer Speech & Language; Osuna, IEEE Transactions on\\nEvolutionary Computation).\\nSupporting progression\\nAll PGRs are assigned a primary supervisor, an independent advisor from the same research\\ngroup and a panel chair from a different group. We supplement University-required annual reviews\\nwith six monthly panel meetings, enabling clear and timely oversight of progress. For students\\nregistering in 2015/16, 89% submitted within their four-year time limit. A 2019 Postgraduate\\nResearch Experience survey showed high overall satisfaction (82%), with positive responses for\\nsupervision (86%), skills development (89%) and resources (85%).\\nSkills training and preparation for future careers\\nAll PGR students complete training courses in research integrity, teamwork and presentation skills\\nand must formulate a data management plan. Each student has a dedicated workspace and\\ndesktop computer and an allowance of £1,500 for conference participation. Outcomes include\\nnumerous prizes for presentations at international conferences (e.g. Ge, International Symposium\\non Search-Based Software Engineering 2017; Naith, International Conference on Crowd Science\\nand Engineering 2018).\\nWe build connections with potential employers through industry talks, engagement with visiting\\nprofessors (e.g. Leidner, Thomson-Reuters), collaboration with our CDT sponsors (e.g. Amazon,\\nNHS Digital) and internships (e.g. Apple, Microsoft, Baidu, Google, Electronic Arts). Success is\\nevidenced by the breadth of professional careers that our PGRs pursue after graduation, including\\npostdoctoral positions (e.g. Loweimi, Edinburgh; Armstrong, Cambridge; Rabehaja, Macquarie)\\nand fellowships (Richmond, EPSRC RSE Fellowship). Several have progressed to lectureships,\\ne.g. Usman (UET Lahore), Roberts (KCL), Alharbi (King Saud University). Derczynski and\\nAugenstein hold professorships at the University of Copenhagen, with Augenstein leading the NLP\\ngroup (line managing 44 people). Our PGRs have taken up significant roles in tech startups (e.g.\\nMokharam, EmoTech) and have been employed by industry leaders (e.g. Gomes, Amazon;\\nDoulaty, Facebook).\\n2.6 Equality, diversity, and inclusion\\nOur strategy is to ensure that our practices in recruitment, staff support and career development\\nfully harness a diverse pool of talent, enabling us to advance our research themes. We implement\\nthis strategy by embedding EDI throughout departmental processes. All staff undertake\\nunconscious bias training; a gender balance is ensured in all committees and appointment panels;\\nand search committees seek applicants from underrepresented groups. The University has an\\nactive Disability Staff Network. Positive responses in the 2018 University Staff Survey confirm that\\nthe Department recognises and values diversity and difference (97%). Over the assessment\\nperiod, we appointed eight women to academic (lecturing or fellowship) positions.\\nAddressing gender equality. Our active engagement with Athena SWAN has led to both Bronze\\n(2013) and a Silver (2016) awards. Through our action plan, mentoring by the HoD and the\\nUniversity’s peer mentoring scheme, we have been successful in improving gender equality in our\\npipeline from ECR to professor. We had 23 promotions, of which 6 were female. We increased the\\nnumber of female professors from zero in 2014 to four over the assessment period, three of whom\\n                                                                                             Page 13\\n\\n\\nwere promoted from within the Department. Currently women account for 36% of lecturers, 22% of\\nsenior lecturers/readers/advanced fellows and 17% of professors. Female academics have\\nobtained £8.6m in external funding since 2014, generating 27% of our research income. This\\nstatistic is impressive, given that three women were recent appointments (<1y) and that, prior to\\n2016, none were professors. Female senior leaders include our Director of Research, two research\\ngroup heads, the Faculty Director of EDI and other leaders in the wider University.\\nEliminating discrimination and promoting diversity. We are a proudly multicultural department\\nwith 32 international academic staff of which 22 were appointed during the assessment period.\\nFirmly embedding EDI principles in our recruitment processes has led to an increased proportion of\\nBAME staff; with 25% of staff self-reporting as BAME. We are committed to supporting our\\nLGBTQ+ staff and PGRs, as evidenced by the University’s Stonewall Top 100 Employers position\\nfor seven years running. We actively support different lifestyles, for example we have flexible\\narrangements for a number of academics with partners in different cities. In our most recent staff\\nsurvey, 96% of staff agreed that they could talk openly with their line manager about flexible\\nworking. We offer targeted help to staff and PGRs with protected characteristics (e.g. changes in\\nworking pattern to accommodate disabilities). Support for international staff includes flexibility with\\noverseas working, which was particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nSupporting mental health and neurodiversity. The Faculty has a wellbeing officer who provides\\nexpert one-to-one support and signposting to students, including PGRs. We plan to further buttress\\nthis support with a dedicated wellbeing officer for the Department. We are liaising with IBM on their\\nindustry-leading work in neurodiversity to gain greater insight into practices for recruiting and\\nsupporting neurodiverse staff; this has informed our ongoing Athena SWAN action plan.\\nParental leave and childcare. In addition to statutory maternity, adoption and shared parental\\nleave, staff on leave can elect to perform up to 10 days of paid work without loss of statutory pay\\n(‘keeping-in-touch’ days). Since 2014, 12 staff members have taken parental leave. All staff taking\\nparental leave remained in employment with the Department after 18 months. One staff member\\nreceived an award of £10k through the University’s Women Academic Returners’ Programme\\n(WARP), which provides financial support for women to mitigate the impact of extended leave on\\nresearch.\\nEquality and diversity issues in the preparation of this REF submission. In accordance with\\nthe University Code of Practice, four principles were applied throughout all stages of our\\nsubmission: transparency, consistency, accountability and inclusivity. Staff with a leading role in\\nour REF submission (3 males, one female) have undertaken unconscious bias training; output\\nselection was overseen by a female academic. The selection of outputs was guided by anonymous\\ninternal and external reviewers. Subsequent validation showed that we had not introduced\\nsignificant gender bias in the selection of outputs. 40% of our impact case studies are led by\\nwomen (20% of academic staff are women).\\n  3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n3.1 Overview\\nWe ensure that our four research themes are well supported through income capture,\\ninfrastructure provision and access to facilities. A particular focus has been to diversify our support\\nbase by increasing our UKRI and industry funding. This diversification reflects opportunities: the\\n                                                                                                Page 14\\n\\n\\nsynergy between UKRI funding priorities (Industrial Strategy, Made Smarter), industry demand for\\nour research (in areas such as SLT), and growth in our research strengths and ambitions.\\nDiversification was also a response to the challenge of uncertainty regarding UK participation in EU\\nresearch schemes. The key outcomes are an increase in grant income from £18.8m in the last\\nperiod to £32.5m and more than doubling industry income from £875k to £2.1m.\\nOur underlying strategy has been multi-pronged. We have actively recruited in areas of strategic\\nimportance, making professorial appointments to enhance leadership and appointments to fill gaps\\nin our expertise (see Section 2.2). This has ensured sustainability of funding across our research\\nthemes. We have sought and achieved positions of leadership in major grants (e.g. EPSRC\\nprogramme grants, fellowships, coordination of EU grants). Time for research and impact is\\nprotected through investment in teaching-specialist posts, sabbaticals and funded short-term study\\nleave (see Section 2.4).\\nAppointing staff with interdisciplinary profiles has created opportunities for new funding streams\\n(e.g. Rosetrees Trust). Our interdisciplinary collaborations allow us to leverage a wide range of\\nfacilities across the University. We leverage and contribute to HPC provision across the University\\nand through national initiatives such as JADE. This reflects the increasing importance of HPC to\\nthe ML interests of almost all of our research groups.\\n3.2 Income\\nResearch grant capture. Our research income increased from £18.8m (REF2014) to £32.5m, with\\nUK, EU, and industry funding in each of our four strategic themes. We have been highly successful\\nin obtaining EU funding; this reflects the international and multidisciplinary nature of our work and\\nthe close alignment of our strengths with EU and UK priorities. We grew our EU funding from less\\nthan £10m (REF2014) to £15.4m. We collaborated with leading European scientists on 39 EU-\\nfunded projects, involving 177 universities, 92 companies and 85 charities, and coordinated 5\\nFP7/Horizon 2020 grants (PROWESS, WeSenseIT, Pheme, CONTESSA, SETA). We achieved\\ndiversification of our grant capture: 56% of our funding was from non-EU sources, an increase from\\n49%. UKRI funding increased from £6.5m to £12.4m. Income from charities was £717k, including\\ngrants from the British Heart Foundation, Wellcome Trust, Rosetrees Trust and Alzheimer’s\\nSociety. 62% of our submitted papers came from funded projects, as did four of our impact case\\nstudies. New staff have been responsible for £6.8m in external funding and approximately 50% of\\nour outputs.\\nLarge grant leadership. Leadership in all four of our themes is demonstrated by major single\\ngrant awards, reflecting the excellence of senior research leaders within the groups. In the\\nbioinspired machine intelligence theme Marshall leads a collaborative EPSRC programme grant,\\nBrains on Board: (£4.8m, £2.2m to Sheffield). This was supported by a lecturer appointment\\n(Mangan). Outputs from the grant include interdisciplinary papers in top journals (e.g. Proceedings\\nof the Royal Society Series B) and a spin-out company (Opteran). In the dependable and secure\\nsystems theme, Clark leads the £4.9m Research England IoT innovation project PITCH-IN, a\\ncollaboration with Oxford, Cambridge, and Newcastle. In the speech and language theme, Hain\\nheld the EPSRC Natural Speech Technology programme grant, which laid the foundation for our\\nCDT and VoiceBase centre.\\nFellowships. Fellowship income totalled £5.1m. An ERC Starting Grant to Specia (£1.2m) led to\\nan impact case study on machine translation, which underpins technology used by Facebook and\\nMicrosoft. A £1.2m ERC Consolidator Grant to Marshall funded his research on bioinspired\\nrobotics, leading to a programme grant (see above) and first-authored interdisciplinary publications\\n                                                                                               Page 15\\n\\n\\nin competitive outlets, e.g. eLife. Richmond and Croucher won 2 of the 7 awards in the first round\\nof the EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellowships. Richmond has since established a\\nteam of 12 people (see Section 3.3); Croucher progressed to Head of Research Computing at the\\nUniversity of Leeds. Oliveto won an EPSRC Early Career Fellowship for his work on the rigorous\\nruntime analysis of bioinspired computing (£1.3m). Over the assessment period, he published over\\n50 papers in, e.g. Theoretical Computer Science and IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary\\nComputation.\\nNew appointees. We support new appointees with dedicated grant writing workshops. EPSRC\\nFirst Grant/New Investigator Awards were obtained by Vlachos (non-monotonic incremental\\nlanguage processing), Alvarez (one-shot learning of human motion), Lu (sparse features for fMRI\\nanalysis) and Ordyniak (parameterized algorithms).\\nIndustry income. This increased from £875k (REF2014) to £2.1m. Notable achievements include\\ntwo new industry-funded centres, with funding totalling £1.4m. The Silicon Valley company\\nVoiceBase funds a centre employing 12 people to support Hain’s research in ASR. A Dstl-funded\\nUniversity Technology Centre for AI in Defence and Security was established in 2020. Staff have\\nbeen successful in obtaining research funding from tech companies, a total of £510k in the\\nassessment period from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, e.g. a Google award to Barker supported\\nhis work on the influential series of CHiME ASR challenges.\\nPGR income. Our reputation for research excellence makes us an attractive environment for PGR\\nstudents; since 2014 our PGR base has expanded by 25%. We have strategically invested our\\nown funds in PGR scholarships to support new staff and major grants; since 2014 we spent ~£3m\\nand have committed £3.35m over the next 5 years. We were awarded a UKRI CDT in Speech and\\nLanguage Technologies, which will train 60 PGRs over 2019-2027. This award provided leverage\\nfor investment in staff within our speech and language theme, with the subsequent appointment of\\nBarrault, Goetze, Lin, Ragni, Scarton and Villavicencio. The CDT has significantly grown our\\nindustry connections, leading to collaborative funding from Amazon Research, Google, Microsoft\\nResearch, NHS Digital and others. We participate in the EU Marie Skłodowska-Curie ITN TAPAS\\n(Christensen, Barker, £454k) and NeuTouch (Prescott, £248k).\\nBy diversifying our support base and building connections across disciplines and with external\\npartners, we are well positioned to respond quickly and flexibly to changing priorities and\\nopportunities. A recent illustration is Lu’s success in winning a highly competitive US National\\nInstitutes for Health AI in Health and Care Award in 2020 (< 8% success rate, £504k) that brought\\ntogether our ML expertise with clinical expertise from Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.\\n3.3 Infrastructure and facilities\\nOur growth in staff numbers is matched by investment in infrastructure and facilities, ensuring that\\nour themes are well supported to generate excellent research and significant impact. Key\\ninvestments during the assessment period are highlighted below.\\nHigh-performance computing. Our strategy is both to fully exploit the extensive HPC facilities\\nprovided by the University and to further contribute to them. We maintain a server room for\\nspecialist equipment but increasingly we are investing in additional nodes for the central HPC\\nclusters Bessemer, ShARC and Iceberg. Together, these provide 350 worker nodes, 6500 CPU\\ncores, 49 TB of RAM, 60 GPUs and 1425 TB of fast network storage. 313 members of our staff\\nand PGR students have accounts for these HPC facilities. We supplemented University investment\\nin HPC facilities with £480k of equipment, in addition to £800k spent on large-memory nodes and\\nGPUs for ML. Recognising the increasing importance of deep learning, particularly for our speech\\n                                                                                              Page 16\\n\\n\\nand language and bioinspired machine intelligence themes, we provide a significant number of\\nstate-of-the-art GPUs to individuals (eight in 2019) and our CDT (three 6GB NVIDIA Titan cards).\\nWe were the first UK university to purchase an NVIDIA DGX-1, an accelerated platform for deep\\nlearning. We are part of a consortium that has access to the JADE Tier 2 GPU cluster, designed\\nfor the needs of machine learning and related data science applications; this also supports work on\\nmachine translation. Going forward, a University £10m plan to deliver a new Research IT and\\nInnovation Strategy has been agreed upon.\\nSheffield Robotics. Our close collaboration with Sheffield Robotics and links to the AMRC\\nprovides access to a wide range of specialised equipment and facilities. In addition to the 200m 2\\nSheffield Robotics lab, a human-robot interaction lab (17m2), a motion capture lab (60m2), two\\nhangars (400m2) and a workshop (40m2) are available. Equipment includes Kilobots (Marshall on\\nthe DIODE project); KUKA iiwa (Law and Gaizauskas, EPSRC Network Plus Connected\\nEverything project); Jaguar 4x4 rovers, Griffon dynamics Octocopters, and DJI Phantom 4 (Law,\\nEPSRC UK-RAS Field Robotics Challenge 2016); iCub (Prescott, Horizon 2020 WYSIWYD and\\nCyberselves projects); 3D printers (Marshall, Green Brain and Brains on Board projects) and\\ndedicated technical support (2 FTE). Sheffield Robotics has won over £1.5m in EPSRC capital\\nawards since 2014, and we supported it with an additional £0.9m for staff and equipment.\\nResearch software engineering. Our RSE group, one of the largest in the UK, grew from 2 FTE\\nin 2016 to 11 FTE. The group largely sustains itself on grant income, but together with central IT\\nservices we underwrite posts to offer staff job security and so to ensure retention. They have been\\ninstrumental in producing software usable by stakeholders, e.g. a web service for fact-checking\\nused by journalists was developed (Rumour Analysis Service (RAS) project, funded by the Google\\nDigital News Initiative and WeVerify, Bontcheva), and they are critical to our reproducibility strategy\\n(see Section 1.5). The team contributes widely to the national RSE agenda through guidance for\\nreproducible research (via The Turing Way with ATI), national training for HPC (via Software\\nSustainability Institute fellowships and HPC carpentry), and leadership (via a Future RSE Leaders\\nworkshop and an RSE Leaders panel) and includes two of the twelve members of the Board of\\nTrustees of the Society of Research Software Engineering.\\nFacilities for specific research clusters. We have an apiary and a beekeeper to support the\\nBrains on Board project and invested £50k to start the Security group (specialist forensics\\nequipment, oscilloscopes, and experimental robotics). Involvement in University interdisciplinary\\nresearch centres and flagship institutes gives access to specialised equipment, such as the\\nCATCH “home lab”, an instrumented living space for supporting research on disabilities, e.g.\\ndementia (Christensen). Lanfranchi’s joint appointment with the NHS has resulted in access to\\nclinical facilities, feeding into over £600k of grant funding. Wang’s work is supported by secure\\ncomputing facilities provided by Genomics England, leading to two grants (over £900k). SANO\\n(see Section 1.3) provides HPC infrastructure to support computational medicine research.\\nTechnical and research support staff. Our technicians (12 FTE) support software and hardware\\ntechnologies, including a dedicated server room. Since 2014, the expansion of our robotics\\nactivities within the bioinspired machine intelligence theme necessitated the appointment of a\\ndedicated safety officer. The Faculty has established a pipeline of technical staff through the\\nEngineering Apprenticeship Scheme, in which apprentices rotate around departments before\\nsettling into an open-ended position. The result is technical staff with well-rounded expertise, able\\nto provide software and hardware support. We invested £29k in the training of technical support\\nstaff. Our research support team (8 FTE) assists the development of funding bids and grant\\nmanagement and identifies potential industrial collaborators. A further 6 FTE provide professional\\nsupport to specific projects and the CDT.\\n                                                                                               Page 17\\n\\n\\nThe Diamond. Completed in 2015 at a cost of £81m (19,500m 2), the Diamond is the largest capital\\ninvestment ever made by the University. Within this, the MindSphere Lounge provides a\\ncollaboration and IoT demonstration space for the University, Siemens and local business (Clark is\\nthe academic lead). The iForge maker space provides 3D printing, CNC and laser cutting and is\\navailable to all staff and PGRs (e.g. for the construction of bespoke hardware).\\nResearch laboratories. Our main office space and research laboratories are in the Regent Court\\nbuilding. We strategically maintain offices in multidisciplinary spaces, which encourages\\ncollaboration and provides additional space for equipment (e.g., Sheffield Robotics). A key part of\\nour ongoing infrastructure strategy is to refurbish Regent Court (an estimated cost of £10.5m plus\\n£1.5m for a student innovation hub). The overall space will increase by 35% and meeting space\\nwill increase by over 50%. The refurbishment will enhance our facilities for collaborative research\\n(e.g. informal working spaces, a large social area, breakout rooms) and opportunities for\\nengagement with the end users of our research (e.g. demonstration spaces).\\n 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society\\n4.1 Overview\\nOur strategy to facilitate collaborations and widespread impact depends on the creation of an\\nenvironment for excellent research: we ensure that our researchers have the necessary time and\\nsupport to develop significant collaborations at the international, national and regional levels. The\\nprevious sections outlined our pipeline for translating fundamental research into real-world impact\\n(Section 1.4) and described our staffing strategy (Section 2) and underpinning infrastructure\\ninvestment (Section 3.3). Here, we highlight the major outcomes arising from our strategy and\\nactions.\\n4.2 Research collaboration\\nMuch of our most impactful work arises from sustained, often interdisciplinary, collaborations. 84%\\nof research outputs produced during the assessment period involved collaborators from a different\\ndiscipline or university. 83 research grants involved an industrial partner or another university.\\nInternational collaboration. International best-with-best collaborative projects facilitate world-\\nleading research. We collaborated on 44 EU projects and coordinated 5 EU FP7/Horizon 2020\\ngrants totalling over £3.3M. We also collaborate with a range of international companies and have\\nreceived nearly £2M in funding from them. Examples include VoiceBase, BioGen, Amazon and\\nMicrosoft. Collaborations are also sustained through our involvement in international centres.\\nActiveAI brings together world leaders in entomology, neuroscience, biorobotic modelling and\\ncomputational neuroscience to develop new algorithms for robust and efficient learning for\\nautonomous robotics. SANO (see Section 1.3) is funded by the EU and Polish government and\\nClayton is on the Scientific Committee.\\nWe also support individual collaborations: our internationally leading research has attracted 99\\nvisitors from 26 countries. Visits of our staff to international collaborators include world-class\\ninstitutions such as the University of Pittsburgh, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, ETH Zürich,\\nUniversity of Zürich, KTH Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm, and Yale University.\\n                                                                                                 Page 18\\n\\n\\nApproximately 60% of our submitted outputs had an international co-author, with 40% externally\\nfunded and 20% stemming from individual collaborations .\\nNational and regional collaboration. Since 2014, our staff held grants of £15.2m with 40 UK\\nacademic collaborators. Of our papers, 12% have been co-authored with other UK universities.\\nProgramme grants have been effective at establishing long-term collaborations with national\\nacademic partners, e.g. Natural Speech Technology (Hain, EPSRC £6.2m) supported a\\ncollaboration with Edinburgh and Cambridge, leading to significant growth in our speech and\\nlanguage theme and ultimately to our CDT.\\nWithin the Sheffield Region our work with Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust led to further\\nNHS collaborations (Sheffield Children's Hospital, Rotherham General Hospital). Outcomes include\\ntechnologies for remote healthcare monitoring and the early detection of conditions, e.g. diabetic\\nretinopathy, funded by 7 projects totalling £331k (Lanfranchi, Villa-Uriol). We collaborate with\\nSheffield mobility-tracking company The Floow, funded by the EU SETA project (Ciravegna,\\n£1.03m), and HumanStudio on virtual/augmented reality for digital heritage (Maddock, funded by\\nthe AHRC and leading to a Festival of the Mind exhibit; see below).\\n4.3 Engagement with key research users, beneficiaries, and audiences\\nOur strategy is to identify key research users aligned with our four research themes and engage\\nwith them through collaborative research projects, technology centres, joint appointments, spin-out\\ncompanies, our CDT and our industrial advisory board (IAB). Key users include IT companies and\\nthe industrial sector, the NHS, education, and policymakers. Our impact pipeline (Section 1.4)\\nplays a crucial role in sustaining long-term, productive engagements with key research users.\\nWithin the speech and language theme, engagement has been driven by strong commercial\\ndemand for our SLT research. Our ASR technology adds $120m to the value of VoiceBase\\n(Automatic Voice Recognition impact case study). Automatic translations in Facebook are\\nunderpinned by our research on quality assessment for machine translation (Machine Translation\\ncase study). ZOO Digital joined our IAB and is now co-developing technology for dubbing video\\ncontent through an Innovate UK grant (MAUDIE, £314k). Initially attracted by the CDT, Huawei are\\nnow supporting SLT research with a further £700k in funding.\\nThe healthcare technologies theme engages with key research users (NHS, Public Health\\nEngland) through research projects, some of which have been catalysed through a joint\\nappointment with Sheffield Teaching Hospitals (Lanfranchi). Ciravegna’s work on mobility tracking\\nled to an impact case study and a spin-out company, Aeqora Ltd. Brown’s work with SME Passion\\nfor Life Healthcare (PFLH) demonstrates how engagement with research users enriches our\\nresearch. A discussion with PFLH suggested that methods developed in our Department could be\\napplied to the acoustic monitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorders, which led to our first\\nKnowledge Transfer Partnership award and a growing research stream on the health applications\\nof acoustic monitoring, supported by a PFLH-funded PGR studentship and a subsequent Innovate\\nUK grant (BRAHMS, £243k).\\nIn the bioinspired machine intelligence theme, a key beneficiary of Prescott’s research is the\\neducation sector: his work on bioinspired robot control is embedded in the MiRo robot, marketed\\nthrough Consequential Robotics Ltd. Approximately 400 units have been sold to schools and\\nuniversities. Working with researchers in Uganda, Smith has contributed ML expertise to a project\\nthat has rolled out 70 low-cost pollution monitoring stations across Kampala, engaging schools,\\nbusinesses, civil society organisations and citizens.\\n                                                                                              Page 19\\n\\n\\nIn the dependable and secure systems theme a key audience is the advanced manufacturing\\ncommunity. A joint appointment with the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (Law) led to\\nthe involvement of AMRC in a TAS Verifiability Node (Hierons), engagement in the security of\\nmanufacturing robotics (AAIP CSI:Cobot, Clark) and a jointly funded PhD studentship (Popescu).\\nThe University has a dedicated account manager for Siemens; this facilitated the opening of the\\nfirst MindSphere Lounge in Sheffield and the involvement of Siemens in PITCH-IN (see Section\\n3.2), which addresses IoT across manufacturing, health, energy, and cities. Research on the\\nsecurity of energy systems with our Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, supported by\\nthe EPSRC £34m Active Building Construction project, provides further opportunities for\\nstakeholder engagement.\\n4.4 Wider contributions to the economy and society\\nStrategic investment in Faculty marketing resource (14 FTE) enabled us to raise the profile of our\\nresearch, leading to influence on policy makers. The high media profile of Bontcheva’s work on\\nfake news led to policy work with the UK government (DCMS report on social media\\ndisinformation) and UNESCO (report on COVID-19 disinformation). Our research on the ethics of\\nautonomous weapons has influenced policy within the UN and non-government organisations such\\nas the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots (Banning LAWS impact case study).\\nWe achieve broad contributions to the economy through the provision of open-source software.\\nOur GATE text engineering platform is used by Oracle, the BBC, the Press Association and\\nEuromoney. FLAME GPU, a high-performance framework for agent-based modelling, allowed\\nAtkins to achieve an order of magnitude speedup in transport simulations. We expect these\\nadvances to be incorporated into the Atkins software used by Highways England.\\nOur research contributes to public health, both internationally and nationally. Clayton has co-\\nauthored a research agenda for uncertainty in computational models of cardiac physiology with\\nregulatory scientists from the US Food and Drug Administration. During the COVID-19 pandemic,\\nwe were agile and responsive. Working with colleagues from four Chinese universities, Yang\\npublished a feasibility study of mitigation and suppression strategies for COVID-19. Richmond led\\na national development team working on COVID-19 modelling to inform the Royal Society RAMP\\ninitiative, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) and the Scottish\\ngovernment. Wang contributed to an effort that sequenced more than 1,000 COVID-19 genome\\nsequences, uploading them to the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium and helping\\nresearchers around the world to fight the pandemic.\\n4.5 Engagement with diverse communities and the public through research\\nWe engage citizens in our research through participatory design studies. Examples include an\\nAHRC-funded grant in which a group of cochlear-implanted users co-developed materials for\\nconversational training (Brown) and patient involvement in developing technology to diagnose\\ndiabetic retinopathy (Lanfranchi, Villa-Uriol).\\nClose engagement has been established with the arts around AI, visualisation and sound. Brown\\ncollaborates with the rock band Reverend and the Makers on AI methods for music generation,\\nsupported by HEIF funding of £54k. This collaboration was featured in Sheffield’s Sensoria festival\\nand led to the foundation of a new AI record label. The biennial Festival of the Mind, has engaged\\napproximately 103,000 people to date. We have provided exhibits that engage the public in our\\nrobotics research (Prescott), virtual and augmented reality (Maddock), and sentiment analysis\\n                                                                                             Page 20\\n\\n\\n(Stevenson). Outside of this festival, our staff regularly engage in “pint of science” pub talks and\\nother events, numbering over 70 in the assessment period.\\nWe have achieved extensive media engagement over the assessment period. Sharkey is a strong\\nvoice in the debate on the ethics of robotics, AI and data science with frequent media contributions\\nincluding The Guardian, BBC News and the New York Times. Lawrence wrote 11 articles for The\\nGuardian on topics relating to the ethics of AI, open data science and data privacy, shared more\\nthan 1500 times via social media and other news outlets. Marshall’s work on biomimetic robotics\\nhas engaged audiences in bee behaviour (BBC Click) and drone delivery (Financial Times, Daily\\nMail).\\nWe are passionate about engaging young audiences in our research. We host the UK-RAS School\\nRobotics Competition and offered more than 28 talks and events addressed to a school audience\\nover the assessment period. Prescott’s interdisciplinary research at the boundary of psychology,\\nneuroscience and robotics has engaged children through the Cyberselves Roadshow and Norwich\\nScience Festival.\\n4.6 Academic leadership and contribution to the sustainability of the discipline\\nThrough our strategy, we are well placed to contribute to the sustainability of the discipline. An\\nexample is research by Marshall, Vasilaki and Mangan within our bioinspired machine intelligence\\ntheme, which promises next-generation AI systems that match insect performance in tasks such as\\nvision and navigation and are power efficient due to having lower computational requirements. We\\nare well placed to develop this theme, with more than £8.9m in funding in place and a route to\\ntranslation through spin-out Opteran.\\nWe actively engage in setting the national agenda. Prescott and Law have co-authored EPSRC\\nUK-RAS white papers on robotics in social care and manufacturing robotics, which have been\\ninfluential in setting EPSRC priorities. Our robotics activity makes us well prepared to respond to\\ninitiatives such as the Made Smarter Review, which identified Sheffield Robotics as a “significant\\ncontributor and innovator in global robotics research” (p. 66). By growing our healthcare\\ntechnologies and dependable and secure systems themes (13 new appointments, see Section\\n2.2), we have strengthened our research base in areas related to AI and data science for health\\nand to Industry 4.0. This puts us in a strong position to respond to developments in the Industrial\\nStrategy. Our RSE group contributes to the sustainability of the discipline by advocating excellence\\nin research software engineering practice through Richmond’s leadership positions in the Software\\nSustainability Institute and the Society of Research Software Engineers (see Section 3.3).\\nWe provide leadership through international steering groups and advisory boards. Six of our staff\\nhold such roles. For example, Vasilaki advises the AI Centre at the University of Mainz, Germany.\\nPrescott leads a UK-RAS strategic task group on robotics, involving 14 organisations spanning\\nuniversities, professional societies and the private sector. Lawrence has been a member of the AI\\nCouncil since it was founded in 2019, an independent expert committee advising the government\\nand high-level leaders of the AI ecosystem.\\nOur staff are active members and leaders of national research networks. We led two EPSRC\\nnetworks (HealTex, POEMS) and participated in 12 others. Hierons is on the BCS-FACS\\ncommittee and acts as their representative on the LMS Computer Science Committee. Since 2007,\\nStruth has co-organised the Midlands Graduate School (MGS) in the Foundations of Computing\\nScience, involving the Universities of Sheffield, Leicester, Nottingham, and Birmingham. Moore\\nand Hain make significant contributions to international leadership of the SLT community as board\\nmembers of the International Speech Communication Association (ISCA).\\n                                                                                                Page 21\\n\\n\\nThe Gaussian Process Summer School, run by Lawrence and Alvarez since 2013, has become a\\nstaple of PGR training and attracts industry delegates from Amazon, Spotify, JPMorgan, Siemens\\nGamesa etc. Data Science Africa, an annual series of workshops led by Lawrence and Smith since\\n2015, has brought together academic and industry experts in data science and ML to deliver\\nresearch training across Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, Ghana and Ethiopia.\\nOur staff make outstanding contributions to international science publications. They hold 20\\neditorial positions, including 3 Editor-in-Chief positions, e.g. Moore is editor-in-chief of Computer\\nSpeech and Language, a key journal in the area of SLT. During the assessment period, 33 of our\\nstaff were involved in organising conferences, with 17 acting as Programme Chair. Lawrence was\\nGeneral Chair of the influential NeurIPS conference (2015) and Hain was Technical Chair of the\\nInterspeech conference (2019).\\n12 of our staff provided leadership as full members of the EPSRC college, three of which are\\nassociate members. 9 colleagues sat on grant panels, 4 as chair. Vasilaki and Clark were in the\\ntop 6% of college members for participating in peer review activities during the academic year\\n2017/18. Our staff were external examiners for theses and habilitations in more than 40 institutions\\nacross 11 countries, including several prestigious universities (e.g. Sorbonne, Oxford, Cambridge,\\nLa Sapienza).\\nThe esteem and success of our staff are reflected by the award of many prizes and honours,\\nincluding 24 keynotes/invited talks and 7 fellowships since REF2014. Hain was elected a Fellow of\\nthe ISCA, and Moore is a Distinguished ISCA Lecturer. 14 staff members are members or fellows\\nof professional societies.\\nWe are immensely proud of our contributions to computer science, our productive engagement\\nwith the end users of our research, and our success in communicating our exciting findings to the\\npublic. Since 2014 our growth has delivered an outstanding complement of staff and increased our\\nmomentum. With a clear strategic plan, we are well placed to build on our strengths over the next\\ndecade and make further significant contributions to the discipline, economy and society.\\n                                                                                                Page 22\\n \", 'b_env']\n",

Table 4 (page 24) shows that 98.4% of the submitted REF outputs involve\\ncollaboration, and our global reach is demonstrated by the fact that 48% of the outputs have an\\ninternational collaborator.\\nResearch Strategy\\nIn early 2016, under UoB’s Vision and Strategy, the Faculty of Engineering developed an ambitious\\ngrowth strategy to make a perpetual, positive impact in the world. This was refreshed in 2020\\nunder a renewed Faculty leadership team. The underpinning priorities are to:\\n     •   apply world-leading research to grand societal challenges\\n     •   inspire and develop future leaders through a challenging educational offering\\n     •   partner with local and global innovators to accelerate impact\\n     •   advance equity and diversity\\nTo achieve our ambitions, our future research objectives for 2020 and beyond are to:\\n     •   demonstrate academic leadership of the highest calibre and develop future leaders\\n     •   continue to grow our research reputation\\n     •   recruit, retain and invest in our great staff and students\\n     •   enhance stewardship of our key research partnerships\\n     •   increase and diversify our external research funding\\n     •   celebrate diversity within our community and encourage inclusivity in all we do\\nResearch Structure\\nOur research groups encourage inter-generational idea sharing, mentoring and training, from PGR\\nthrough postdoc and early-career academic to professorial level. A critical mass of expertise in\\neach discipline also supports collaboration between the five research groups in UoA11, with many\\nstaff belonging to more than one research group and hence contribute to both discipline-based and\\ninter-disciplinary research:\\nArtificial Intelligence and Autonomy (AI&A)\\nAI&A has 21 academics, 28 research associates, and 50 PGR students. It is led by Liu, who is a\\nmember of the EPSRC ICT Strategic Advisory Team (ICT SAT). It was supported by 70 grants and\\nincome of £8.9m.\\n                                                                                                Page 3\\n\\n\\nAI&A works across four domains, each led by a champion: Machine Learning (Flach), Robotics\\nand Autonomy (Lepora), Neural Computation (Houghton) and Financial Data Analytics (Cliff).\\nMachine Learning’s strength in putting \"humans in the loop\" in artificial intelligence systems led to\\nthe award of the Interactive Artificial Intelligence CDT. Robotics and Autonomy anticipates a future\\nwhich integrates traditional robot control with modern machine learning and insights from nature.\\nNeural Computation seeks insights into computation and mathematics by studying how the brain\\nworks, and Financial Data Analytics is concerned with the application of machine learning in the\\nfinancial sector and its relationship with the sector’s legal and regulatory framework.\\nThe group is well-connected to the Alan Turing Institute, UoB’s JGI, the Bristol Robotics Laboratory\\n(BRL) and international academic networks. AI&A has more than 30 external partners including\\nFacebook, Google, Microsoft, FiveAI, Amazon, EDF Energy and Dyson, and make significant\\ncontributions to several important cross-disciplinary grants including the large-scale digital health\\nproject SPHERE (Flach, Santos-Rodriguez; £15.2m).\\nCybersecurity and Cryptography (C&C)\\nC&C has nine academics, 12 research associates, and 22 PGR students. Leadership is provided\\nby Rashid, who chairs the Scientific Advisory Board of EPSRC-NCSC Research Institute on\\nSociotechnical Cyber Security (RISCS) and served on two UK government cyber expert groups. It\\nwas supported by 54 grants and income of £9.8m.\\nThe Cybersecurity domain (champion: Rashid), formed in January 2018, leads on security and\\nvulnerability analysis of cyber-physical systems, including the development of novel\\ncountermeasures (e.g. intrusion detection systems, vulnerability analysis tools, novel security\\narchitectures, and human and organisational factors) along with data science approaches to\\ncybercriminal activities and countermeasures.\\nResearch in the Cryptography domain (champion: Page), established in 2000 by Prof. Smart, is\\nfocused on the hardware and software needed to implement secure systems and spans a broad\\nrange of theoretical and practical aspects, from foundational research and number theory to design\\nand formal security analysis of cryptographic protocols. Current specialisms include high-\\nassurance design and implementation techniques, implementation attacks, and post-quantum\\ncryptography.\\nStrong combined research capabilities have made UoB a major centre for cybersecurity and\\ncryptography research from the mathematical to the practical. Rashid leads the National Cyber\\nSecurity Programme, the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) project, which has defined\\nfoundations for the field and underpins national certification of academic degrees by the National\\nCyber Security Centre (NCSC). The group leads projects as part of major national programmes\\n(RISCS, RITICS, RISE, PETRAS, Discribe), hosts a CDT in Cyber Security, and plays an\\nimportant role in the RF Open Attack Surface as part of the £2.23m SWAN prosperity partnership.\\nKey collaborators include NCSC, Vodafone, Google, HP, Airbus and Thales. The group also has\\nclose relationships with the Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research.\\nVisual Information Laboratory (VI-Lab)\\nVI-Lab has 10 academics, 14 research associates, and 28 PGR students. It is led by Bull who is a\\nFellow of both the IEEE and IET, and PI of a Platform Grant in Vision Science (Vision for the\\nFuture, 2014-2019). It was supported by 65 grants with income of £7.7m.\\n                                                                                                Page 4\\n\\n\\nVI-Lab\\'s international reputation is built on fundamental and applied interdisciplinary research\\nencompassing computer vision, image processing and visual communications. VI-Lab is a key\\nelement of the Bristol Vision Institute (BVI, of which Bull is founder and Director), an\\ninterdisciplinary organisation of 160 associates which promotes research collaboration in vision\\nscience and its applications, across computer science, engineering, biology, psychology, medicine,\\nand the creative arts.\\nIn egocentric vision, Damen led the collection and release of EPIC-KITCHENS, the world’s most\\ncomprehensive dataset for in-home health monitoring and activity analysis. Consequently, Damen\\nwas one of only 20 academics worldwide to be named a Nokia Research Collaborator in 2016, as\\nwell as a Facebook Research Collaborator in 2019. Other highlights are Burghardt’s animal\\nbiometric method, deployed by Save Our Seas Foundation to track and identify great white sharks,\\nand research expertise in computer vision, utilised by Amazon, Samsung, Perceptual Robotics\\n(Mayol-Cuevas, Calway) and others.\\nResearch excellence and longstanding collaborations with the creative sector in the South-West\\nhave culminated in the ISCF/AHRC Bristol and Bath Creative Industry Cluster and leadership of\\nthe £46m MyWorld project, whereby UoA11 researchers connect regional and national creative\\npartners (e.g. the BBC, Aardman Animations, Bristol Old Vic) with global tech giants (Netflix,\\nGoogle, Microsoft), to forge new creative sector opportunities in the South West.\\nFundamentals of Computing (FoC)\\nFoC comprises 14 academics, 14 research associates, and 19 PGR students, led by McIntosh-\\nSmith, who is Technical Chair of the £50m UKRI ARCHER2 national HPC service design and\\nprocurement project and sits on the EPSRC\\'s e-infrastructure strategic advisory team as well as\\nthe EPSRC resource allocation panel for the UK\\'s national supercomputer resource. The group is\\nsupported by 61 grants with an income of £7.6m and a further £7.1m of EPSRC capital grants.\\nThe group works across four domains of interest, each led by a champion. High-Performance\\nComputing (McIntosh-Smith) focuses on the application of heterogeneous and many-core\\ncomputing to solve large-scale scientific problems with a focus on energy-efficient adaptive\\ncomputing for scientific, video and machine learning applications. Algorithms and\\nComplexity (Clifford) aims to provide scalable solutions to existing problems and to understand\\nthe limits of what is possible. Programming Languages (Wang) spans theoretical foundations,\\nlanguage design and implementation, program analysis and synthesis and works with both agile\\nstart-ups, like DiffBlue and industry giants, like GitHub, whose code navigation features are\\npowered by our work on algebraic effects (see impact case study on GitHub). Trustworthy\\nSystems (Eder) focusses on all aspects of trustworthiness throughout the system stack, from\\nhardware to software, (e.g. safety and functional correctness, predictability, security, privacy), as\\nwell as traditional dependability (integrity, robustness, reliability and graceful degradation).\\nBy uniting these domains, the group provides a multi-faceted understanding of key issues like\\nreliability, scalability, and reusability. The group co-leads (with AI&A) the £3m functionality node\\nunder the UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Call and Pamunuwa was awarded an RAEng\\nSenior Research Fellowship with Microsemi. Industry partners include Cray, Arm, the Met Office,\\nHuawei, Intel/Altera, NVIDIA, Fujitsu, XMOS, Graphcore, XILINX, AWE, and Rolls-Royce.\\n                                                                                                 Page 5\\n\\n\\nBristol Interaction Group (BIG)\\nBIG has eight academics, 10 research associates, and 10 PGR students, and is led by Roudaut.\\nThe group is supported by 32 grants and £5m research income.\\nThe group’s research includes novel interactive devices, and their deployment and evaluation in\\neveryday settings such as healthcare, sustainability and fabrication, including the recent\\ndevelopment of artificial skin. The relationship between technology and everyday life “in the wild” is\\nevolving to inform health, care and wellbeing projects (diabetes, multiple sclerosis, mental health,\\nhearing loss and older-adult care). The HCI group works with industry partners such as Quin and\\nPassiveSystems, grassroots activists such as WeAreNotWaiting and Hearing Hacks, public bodies\\nsuch as Bristol City Council and the BBC, and charities such as Knowle West Media Centre.\\nBIG is proud to be a very inclusive team: 14 researchers and eight of the academics are female\\nand many balance successful careers with family commitments. Major successes during the REF\\nperiod include:\\n    •   EPSRC Leadership Fellowship (Fraser)\\n    •   £1m EPSRC grant on Virtual Realities (Cater)\\n    •   EPSRC Fellowship (Metatla)\\n    •   EPSRC Environment Change Challenge Fellowship (Chitchyan)\\nFunding was obtained from XMOS, Texas instruments, Royal Society, Microsoft Research,\\nAHRC, Ultraleap, Leverhulme Trust, Nvidia and EC. The group set up strong interactions with\\nindustrial partners such as Nokia, Microsoft Research, Tactual Labs, Kooth, and Quin.\\nImpact Strategy\\nWe want all our researchers to maximise the impact of their research. Support and training are\\ncoordinated by the School Impact Director, who sits on the School Management Team. The Impact\\nDirector helps academics and research groups recognise and facilitate the wider impact of their\\nwork. He also works closely with the ILO and RED teams (see REF5a) to prepare Innovate UK,\\nEPSRC IAA and ISCF proposals and advise on the management of IP and the setting up of spin-\\nout and start-up companies.\\nWe are continually developing ways to:\\n    •   encourage and support diverse impact activities which build on academic research\\n        success: e.g. industrial secondments and co-funded posts.\\n    •   develop meaningful relationships with end-users for effective collaboration and technology\\n        transfer, thus maximising the benefit of our research to society, e.g. partnership with\\n        LV=GI.\\n    •   recognise and reward those who actively engage with impact activities (up to two of ten\\n        promotion criteria relate to engagement and impact).\\nWe have made significant progress in creating impact through:\\n    •   Judicious use of the EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account. Over the REF period, UoA11\\n        secured 30 IAA projects (value £840k) to support commercialisation, knowledge transfer\\n        secondments, and early-career researcher kick-starter grants. This underpinned two of the\\n        impact case studies: Ultraleap and XMOS. The IAA also supported the appointment of a\\n                                                                                                Page 6\\n\\n\\n        Business Fellow (McIntosh-Smith) to lead industry-facing activities that showcase and\\n        promote research impact.\\n    •   Supporting staff to secure intellectual property through patents where appropriate: e.g.\\n        Pamunuwa’s work with Microsemi.\\n    •   Two new External Advisory Boards for the Department of Computer Science (one with a\\n        specific focus on data science) to complement the long-standing Industrial Advisory Board\\n        in the Department of Engineering Maths. These are regularly consulted on research\\n        strategy.\\n    •   Impact workshops and training events for academics and postgraduate students.\\n    •   Funding for summer undergraduate internships focussed on impact.\\n    •   Embedding impact training in our CDTs and ensuring that industrial partners provide\\n        opportunities for collaborative projects.\\n    •   Establishing new companies such as Unbound Tech, Mogrify, and Perceptual Robotics and\\n        continuing to support our more-established spin-out companies; Ultrahaptics (now\\n        Ultraleap) and XMOS (both impact case studies), which have seen continued success and\\n        growth (e.g. XMOS itself spun out a successful new company called Graphcore, which to\\n        date has raised $710m in investment and is valued at $2.8B).\\n    •   Strengthening existing partnerships through EPSRC Prosperity Partnerships (Thales, Rolls-\\n        Royce) and embedding industrial partners in UoA11 (Thales, LV=GI).\\n    •   Visiting industrial fellows, hosting industry on campus, and secondments of academic staff\\n        to commercial organisations (see Section 2).\\nImpact Example: In 2017 global technology company Thales Group chose the University of Bristol\\n(UoB) as its first UK strategic partner university. Thales has worked with UoB for 20 years on\\nseveral joint UK/EU-based research projects, while supporting over 15 doctoral students. Thales’\\nprogramme (security, communications, sensors, autonomy and complex systems), focusses on\\nthe Faculty of Engineering.\\n        “Thales has a real capacity to innovate through collaboration across the entire\\n        high-tech ecosystem, including with start-ups and universities. We are proud to\\n        broaden our partnerships by working with the University of Bristol, which has\\n        excellent research facilities and high-quality students looking at complex technical\\n        challenges.” Marko Erman, Thales Chief Technical Officer\\nPolicyBristol facilitates engagement with local councils and central government (see REF5a).\\nSeveral academics have served as consultants or advisors to major UK and EU governmental\\ndepartments and regulatory bodies (see Section 4) and have been called to serve as senior expert\\nwitnesses in major civil and criminal legal cases (Cartlidge, Cliff, May).\\nThe research of Preist and Schien makes it possible to assess the energy (and climate change)\\nimpacts of digital services across the internet. Guardian News and Media used their research to\\nenhance their Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, adopting a new environmental KPI. The BBC\\nused it to change practice in both R&D and board-level strategy, by assessing change in UK\\nelectricity demand induced by different strategies for the broadcast-to-streaming switchover.\\n                                                                                              Page 7\\n\\n\\nInterdisciplinary Research\\nWe work within and across research groups, across Faculties, with other institutions and\\norganisations both nationally and internationally to maximise our success, recognising that\\ncollegiality, collaboration, and partnership are at the heart of impactful research.\\nIn line with UoB strategy to foster interdisciplinary research (see REF5a) we strongly encourage\\nresearchers to explore collaborations outside their research groups through engagement with:\\n     •  cross-Faculty research centres (e.g. BVI, Bristol Neuroscience (BN))\\n     •  University Research Institutes (Jean Golding Institute (JGI), BDFI, and Elizabeth Blackwell\\n        Institute (EBI))\\n     •  inter-University partnerships (e.g. GW4 and BRL with UWE)\\n     •  third-party organisations (e.g. Bristol VR Lab in collaboration with UWE, Bath Spa\\n        University, Rocketmakers - funded by Innovate UK and the West of England Combined\\n        Authority)\\n     •  international links (e.g. Smart at KU Leuven (Belgium), Mayol-Cuevas at Amazon (USA),\\n        Warinschi at Dfinity (Switzerland)).\\nNot only does this facilitate innovative research ideas but exposure to interdisciplinary,\\nintersectoral and international research experiences has been shown to positively influence\\nresearch integrity.\\nTo support such interdisciplinary work, the RED team works with the SCEEM Research\\nCommittee, tracking available sources of research funding to support interdisciplinary research,\\nand proactively encouraging individual researchers to apply for specific funding calls as they arise.\\nWorking across Faculties: VI-Lab, AI&A and C&C have been active participants in BDFI (see\\nSection 2 of REF5a). The AI&A group is closely involved with the JGI. CNS works in collaboration\\nwith BN, while BIG uses participatory design to work with medics and patients to create innovative\\ntherapies.\\nWorking across universities: UoB is part of the GW4 alliance, along with Bath, Cardiff and Exeter,\\nand this provides a framework for collaboration in order to strengthen the economy across the\\nregion through undertaking pioneering research with industry partners.\\nExample: The GW4/Met Office/Cray Inc. Isambard computer is the world’s first ARM-based\\nproduction supercomputer, and as the Isambard impact case study demonstrates, provided the\\ntemplate for a new generation of ARM-based supercomputers, creating a new market worth\\nhundreds of millions of dollars.\\nWorking with other organisations: In recognition of our research strength in data science and\\nstrategic desire to grow these activities, UoB joined the Alan Turing Institute in 2018. Five\\nacademics in UoA11 are Turing Fellows (Flach, Houghton, McIntosh-Smith, Palomares\\nCarrascosa, Rashid) and have engaged in the Ethics Advisory Board and in grant-funded projects.\\nIn 2020, Bristol was chosen as one of two centres for the Enrichment Scheme and will welcome 15\\nPhD students in October 2021. Flach\\'s Turing Fellowship was supported by a two-year grant\\nentitled \"Towards a Measurement Theory for Data Science and AI\": the project resulted in two\\n                                                                                              Page 8\\n\\n\\nconference papers, an invited journal submission, a tutorial, and open-source software. The work\\nattracted international attention, leading to five invited talks and several seminars.\\nOpen Research\\nAs detailed in the REF5a, UoB and UoA11 are committed to open access to research. Pre-final-\\nprint copies of publications are routinely placed as open access on our institutional document\\nservers, arXiv and bioRxiv, following the requirements of major funding agencies. Our research\\ndata is accessible via UoB’s Research Data Storage Facility, which provides secure, long-term\\ndata storage systems. Where computational code is a key deliverable, researchers are\\nencouraged to make the source-code written as research tools freely available via public-domain\\nopen-source repositories such as GitHub, thereby enabling peer scrutiny, replication, and\\nextension of our work. A key code navigation tool in GitHub was re-implemented based on\\nresearch in UoA11 (see GitHub impact case study).\\nResearch Integrity\\nUoB is committed to meeting the commitments of the Concordat to support Research Integrity and\\nis a member of UKRN, a network of over 40 UK institutions that works with researchers,\\nuniversities, and a range of stakeholders to promote initiatives that further research rigour,\\nrobustness and quality. Furthermore, UoB is a signatory to the Declaration on Research\\nAssessment (DORA - see REF5a).\\nAs CS&I research increasingly relies on data and/or considers how humans interact with\\ntechnology, our researchers adhere to special procedures for working with and collecting data from\\nliving participants. We require ethical working to be embedded, from the planning stage to write-up\\nand publication. We emphasise through training and open dialogue that students and staff are\\nexpected to undertake research in an ethical manner. The Faculty Ethics Committee (chaired by\\nHoughton) upholds robust values around responsible innovation, ensuring that research projects\\nare conducted professionally and ethically through a constructive, supportive and facilitative\\ndialogue with researchers.\\n  2. People\\nOverview\\nIt is our ambition to shape the digital world by ensuring that our staff and PGR students reach their\\nfullest potential as computer scientists and engineers. We seek to recruit from the widest possible\\npool of candidates, to encourage creativity, and to create a supportive, inclusive community in\\nwhich all colleagues can flourish. We are mindful of the importance of maintaining a balance\\nbetween senior academics and early-career researchers to maximise the scope for active\\ncollaboration and mentoring, and to ensure succession planning through training and development.\\nWe are submitting 21 professors (three female), 25 readers/senior lecturers/associate professors\\n(five female), 15 lecturers (two female), one senior research fellow (female). We acknowledge a\\nhistoric lack of diversity and have been striving to improve equity and inclusion so everyone can\\nexcel. Over the last six years, our approach has developed, and we are determined to ensure that\\nthe composition of our academic body and the culture and environment of SCEEM better reflect\\n                                                                                               Page 9\\n\\n\\nwider society. We take pride in having a culture of opportunity where all staff and all PGR students\\ncan flourish.\\n                                     Figure 2: UoA11 REF staff submission.\\nStaffing strategy and staff development\\nIt is our ambition to shape the digital world by supporting our staff and students to reach their\\nfullest potential as computer scientists and engineers. We recruit from the widest possible pool of\\ncandidates, encourage a desire to be creative and enable a truly diverse and inclusive community\\nto realise its vision. A balance between senior academics and early-career researchers maximises\\nscope for active collaboration and mentoring and creates a pathway for succession-planning\\nthrough training and development.\\nA national skills shortage in computer science and engineering, strong demand from top-quality\\nstudents and our sustained track record of research excellence resulted in UoB’s strategic decision\\nto grow the Faculty. Since the last REF period, Faculty academic staff numbers (including research\\nstaff) have grown from 399 in July 2013 to 481 in July 2020 and our UoA11-returnable headcount\\ngrew by 48%, from 42 to 62. During the REF period UoA11 had a healthy turnover. Eleven\\npathway one academics, three professors (2.5 FTE), five senior lecturers/readers (4.5 FTE), and\\nthree lecturers left, while four professors, 11 senior lecturers/associate professors (10.2 FTE) and\\n14 lecturers were recruited. The good record of promotion to professor (mirrored at more junior\\nlevels) is evidence for the success of our staff development.\\nNotable high-level appointments (4 female):\\n     •   strategic appointment: 2018 Rashid\\n     •   senior appointments: 2015 Bullock, 2017 Liu, Nabney\\n     •   promotions at professorial level: 2016 Eder, Mayol-Cuevas, McIntosh-Smith, Oswald (left\\n         2019), 2017 Preist, 2018 Achim, Calway, Cater, Lepora.\\n                                                                                              Page 10\\n\\n\\nStrong early-career appointments with outstanding research potential (4 female):\\n     •  2015 Katsenou, O’Donnell, Santos-Rodriguez\\n     •  2017 Cartlidge, Chitchyan, O’Kane, Ramsay\\n     •  2018 Bird, Konrad, Costa, Marshall, Pasquier, Wang\\n     •  2019 Aitchison, Dupressoir, Edwards, Lapinskas, Martindale, McConville, Rawat\\n     •  2020 Craggs, David, Kavvos, Metatla, Simpson.\\nAs an example of effective recruitment, we extended our expertise in cryptography into the domain\\nof cybersecurity. Rashid was a strategic appointment from Lancaster in January 2018. His\\nleadership in C&C resulted in five new computer science academic posts aligned with\\ncybersecurity under UoB’s strategic investment programme.\\nWe successfully employed “proleptic” appointments to retain talented staff in a permanent\\nacademic post upon completing a substantial competitive research fellowship (for example,\\nChitchyan, EPSRC Environment Change Challenge Fellowship).\\nOver the REF period, the following improvements to recruitment and selection procedures have\\nhelped increase diversity:\\n     •  all advertisements stated that part-time and job-share applications will be considered and\\n        link to our family and career network\\n     •  gender-diverse interview panels\\n     •  mandatory training for all panel members in EDI including avoiding unconscious bias\\n     •  an EDI-related question was asked of interview candidates\\n     •  separate male/female shortlists piloted\\nOur future staffing strategy is to invest further in growing our staff complement: early-career\\nacademics to match the growth in education and research activities, and strategic appointments to\\ndeliver large-scale research projects (such as BDFI and MyWorld) and to develop other research\\nstrengths of the Faculty (for example, to support Digital Engineering and Sustainability).\\nCareer progression and promotions\\nWe strongly encourage staff to use the annual review process to discuss research objectives,\\nobtain feedback on performance, identify development and training needs, and receive guidance\\non promotion. Individuals benefit from a wide range of internal courses and bespoke training,\\nincluding proposal mock-panel interviews. Those in management roles are supported to undertake\\nappropriate development programmes.\\nAdvice on promotions is provided through line managers and diversity in applications is\\nencouraged through mentoring and CV-sharing. The Dean and HR lead an annual ‘demystifying\\npromotions’ workshop to explain the process, so staff (particularly those from under-represented\\ngroups) have confidence to apply.\\nStaff support\\nWe recognise the pressures and challenges associated with pursuing an academic career. The\\nfollowing Faculty activities and schemes, implemented during the REF period, support our\\nacademics in their research:\\n                                                                                              Page 11\\n\\n\\n    •    Our workload model ensures a fair and transparent balance between\\n         teaching/administrative responsibilities and research.\\n    •    A protected afternoon each week is used to ringfence dedicated research time.\\n    •    Our timetabling constraints process offers all staff teaching duties scheduled around caring\\n         responsibilities.\\n    •    Line managers are encouraged to focus on a quality induction, with monthly School and\\n         Faculty induction sessions. An online repository of materials is available to new starters\\n         (with particular focus on ECRs).\\n    •    Clear documentation is provided on what is expected from academics in terms of research,\\n         education, PGR supervision, administrative and citizen duties and what support they can\\n         expect.\\nIn response to staff survey feedback in November 2019, Faculty Board approved a Study Leave\\nPolicy for implementation from September 2021 (delayed by Covid-19). Eligibility criteria relate to\\nthe individual’s prior contributions to teaching, research and admin/citizenship. We will consider\\nhow study leave fits with the individual’s own development/ambitions/career plans and with broader\\nresearch group/School/Faculty strategy/objectives. We are confident that study leave will enhance\\nthe research environment and quality of research outputs by allowing academics to focus on more\\nambitious projects. Periods of study leave to undertake research at other HEIs, in the UK,\\noverseas or in industry, have been supported previously but a formal scheme will encourage staff\\nto be more ambitious in their applications.\\nSeveral staff have been supported so they can engage with both commercial and academic\\ninstitutions in flexible ways that suit them and the partner, including:\\n    •    partial secondments, (Mayol-Cuevas at Amazon, Warinschi at Dfinity)\\n    •    partial buy-out (Martin, Senior Fellowship at BT)\\n    •    visiting international positions (Achim, Université de la Cote d’Azur).\\nSupport for early-career researchers (ECRs)\\nOf our UoA11 staff, 23.6% are ECRs. In their first two years, they are given a reduced workload\\n(usually half), priority for PGR studentships, a mentor and personal start-up funding to pump-prime\\nnew activities and support attending conferences and developing industrial links. In addition to the\\nUoB-level ECR career-development activities (e.g. grant-writing, leading research teams, and\\npublic engagement through Bristol Clear), the Faculty’s tailored ECR development framework\\noffers training and networking activities, monthly meet-to-talk coffee sessions, research sandpits,\\nindividual mentoring and researcher group-mentoring. ECR-focused activities are coordinated by\\n(later-stage) ECRs and supported by senior academics. For example, in the Faculty’s annual\\npump-priming call, over 70% of the projects funded have ECRs as co-applicants.\\nUoA11 has 62 postdoctoral research associates (PDRAs). As noted in the REF5a, we are\\ncommitted to the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. Staff are aware\\nof the responsibilities for managers and the organisation in terms of recruitment and selection,\\nrecognition and value, support and career development and diversity and equality.\\nThe Faculty’s dedicated project manager for staff experience works with colleagues to deliver\\nactions identified from the 2015 staff survey with a particular focus on PDRAs. We give our\\nresearchers a voice to raise concerns and shape their own experience. Through a network led by\\n                                                                                               Page 12\\n\\n\\nthe PDRAs themselves, they can meet colleagues across the Faculty, benefit from lateral/peer\\nmentoring and learn about the many UoB support functions. PDRA representatives (elected by the\\nPDRAs) sit on the SCEEM Research Committee and feed into decisions about research strategy\\nand targeted training.\\nWe have recognised that the precarious nature of fixed-term contracts generates stress for\\nresearch staff and prevents them feeling truly included and valued as members of the community.\\nWe have moved away from fixed-term contracts towards open-ended contracts with fixed term\\nfunding. PDRAs are most at risk from uncertain funding and we are increasing efforts to provide\\nthem with opportunities to build skills and experience to enhance their employability, whether they\\nremain in academia or move elsewhere (with both career choices encouraged as equally valid).\\nInitiatives include student supervision, teaching, and running their own research projects (e.g.\\nsummer internships).\\nOur early career pipeline: Our research strength and environment ensure that we are an attractive\\nlocation for new early-career staff bringing independent fellowships to Bristol. During the REF\\nperiod, UoA11 hosted 6 independently-funded Fellowships held by ECRs (see page 2).\\nSupport mechanisms, training and supervision of PGR students\\nOur PGR student body grew from 70 in 2013/4 to 129 in 2019/20. We fully integrate PGR students\\ninto our rich research culture. They have world-class opportunities to support their development as\\nleaders of future research, innovation and impact. Our supportive environment nurtures and\\ndevelops deep technical expertise, creative problem-solving skills, technical and non-technical\\ncommunication, and training in enterprise, innovation, and technology translation.\\n                         Figure 3: Growth of the UoA11 PGR community.\\nA small selection of examples of PGR student successes as follows:\\n     •   Ellie Birbeck - best student paper, IEEE SSCI 2018\\n     •   Tom Deakin - best paper, CUG 2019; serves on Khronos international standards body for\\n         SYCL parallel programming language; proceedings chair for IOWCL workshop for three\\n         years\\n     •   Patrick Atkinson - language committee for OpenMP Architecture Review Board (2018)\\n     •   Kacper Sokol - won funding from Thales in 2018 to develop fairness, accountability and\\n         transparency forensics toolbox\\n     •   Hazel Doughty - co-organised Women in Computer Vision at CVPR 2020\\n                                                                                             Page 13\\n\\n\\nFunding\\nThe Faculty’s track record of excellent postgraduate training resulted in exceptional success in\\nboth the 2013 and the 2019 EPSRC calls for Centres for Doctoral Training. Bristol was the most\\nsuccessful institution in the 2019 call, and the Faculty leads six centres and participates in a further\\ntwo.\\nIn UoA11, we lead two new CDTs:\\n    •   CDT in Interactive Artificial Intelligence (£6.84m, 2019-2027) (PI: Flach)\\n    •   CDT in Trust, Identity, Privacy and Security in Large-Scale Infrastructures (TIPS-at-Scale)\\n        (£6.24m, 2019-2027) (PI: Rashid)\\nResearchers within UoA11 contribute strongly to the leadership of other CDTs:\\n    •   CDT in Digital Health and Care (Co-I Santos-Rodriguez, £6.3m, 2019-2027) - see under\\n        UoA12.\\n    •   CDT in Future Autonomous and Robotic Systems: FARSCOPE CDT (Co-Director Liu,\\n        £4.8m, 2017-2028) - also under UoA12.\\n    •   Neural Dynamics (Co-Director: Houghton, Wellcome Trust, 2016-2023).\\n    •   VI-Labs was also a key partner in the EU FP7 Marie Curie ITN ‘Provision’.\\nCombining existing CDTs and Doctoral Training Partnerships, the Faculty’s doctoral training\\nfunding from EPSRC totals over £65m, £24m of which directly involves UoA11 (several of the\\nCDTs span both UoA11 and UoA12 and have Co-Directors from both UoAs). Together with\\nfinancial and in-kind support from industry and institutions, funding for postgraduate training\\nexceeds £100m. We have been awarded 10 Industrial iCASE studentships. UoA11 has 129\\ncurrent PGR students and graduated 174 PhD students between Aug 2013 and July 2019.\\nRecruitment\\nCDT recruitment is managed by centre directors and managers. Non-CDT studentships are\\noverseen by the Faculty Postgraduate Director (Howden, UoA12) and two School Postgraduate\\nDirectors (Marshall in SCEEM). All PGR applications are reviewed by at least three academic staff\\nwho have all undertaken EDI training. Greater awareness of the importance of diversity led to an\\nincrease in the recruitment of female and BAME students (see Table 1).\\nTable 1: Gender and ethnicity of PGR students in UoA11.\\n                Ethnicity                                   Gender\\n  Year          BAME           White           Not          Female        Male         Other\\n                                               Known\\n  2013/14       29.6%          66.7%           3.7%         18%           82%          0%\\n  2014/15       32%            64%             4%           16%           84%          0%\\n  2015/16       26.9%          69.2%           3.8%         16%           84%          0%\\n  2016/17       30.8%          65.4%           3.8%         19%           81%          0%\\n  2017/18       29.6%          63%             7.4%         19%           81%          0%\\n  2018/19       34.5%          58.6%           6.9%         24%           76%          0%\\n  2019/20       32.4%          61.8%           5.9%         26%           74%          0%\\n                                                                                               Page 14\\n\\n\\nMonitoring and Support\\nAll students are supported by at least two supervisors. They can be from different departments or\\ndisciplines but at least one must have already supervised a PGR student to completion. We\\nencourage industrial supervisors and international partners. Joint supervision benefits the student,\\nprovides valuable training for research staff and is an excellent collaborative interdisciplinary\\nmechanism which enriches the student experience. Progress and support are reinforced by annual\\nprogress monitoring comprising a written report and interview (involving an independent assessor\\nand interviewer) with detailed feedback.\\nAll postgraduates belong to a research group. Postdoctoral researchers are outstanding role\\nmodels, for example, leading seminar series, delivering training courses and championing public\\nengagement activities. A Faculty PGR conference, run by PGR students, has been run for the past\\ntwo years to showcase the depth and breadth of research and allow students to get to know each\\nother. Many CDTs also run their own conferences, with a focus on engaging with industry partners.\\nUoA11 has a large number of PGR students completing their studies each year (Table 2). The\\ngrowing number of students have led to a vibrant PGR community.\\nTable 2: Doctoral awards and PhD students.\\n                  Year             Number of doctoral            Number of students\\n                                   awards (data from             (all years)\\n                                   HESA)\\n                  2013/14          28                            70\\n                  2014/15          22                            73\\n                  2015/16          18                            71\\n                  2016/17          23                            84\\n                  2017/18          19                            86\\n                  2018/19          18                            103\\n                  2019/20          15                            129\\nThe total number of doctorates awarded to students with supervisors from UoA11 over the REF\\nperiod was 174, approximately 30 more than the total attributed to UoA11 from Table 2. This\\nreflects positively on the frequency of inter-disciplinary collaboration and the degree to which co-\\nsupervision occurs with academics outside of UoA11.\\nResearch and Skills Training\\nStudents have mandatory talks covering induction, safety, facilities, and laboratory practices. CDTs\\noffer bespoke courses (mandatory for CDT students) and we facilitate PGRs to be co-trained with\\nCDT cohorts wherever practicable. Students are encouraged, where appropriate, to attend\\nspecialised MSc taught courses offered at Bristol.\\nAs described in the REF5a, in addition to discipline-specific training, our students can access a\\nwide range of skills and career support offered by the Bristol Doctoral College. The Personal and\\nProfessional Development (PPD) programme offers the following professional support to all our\\nresearch students:\\n                                                                                                Page 15\\n\\n\\n    •   networking opportunities\\n    •   information on research grants\\n    •   a bespoke online progress management tool\\n    •   training in personal development and wellbeing\\n    •   professional and career development\\n    •   guidance on responsible research\\n    •   training in conference presenting, CV writing, research ethics, public engagement, etc.\\nUoB’s Careers Service Postgraduate Employability Advisor supports PGR students in identifying\\ncareer options and preparing for the world of work. PGR students are encouraged to get involved\\nwith the Bristol PLUS award which is designed to enhance employability. Many of our graduates\\ncontinue in research, 64% as PDRAs and 27% in industry or government.\\nPGR students can work with the Basecamp Enterprise Team, who support start-ups and help\\ndevelop enterprise and entrepreneurial skills. Through the New Enterprise Competition students\\npitch for start-up funding and UoB is a founding partner of the world’s top university business\\nincubator, SETsquared, and the award-winning Engine Shed (see REF5a). Many of the CDTs\\nprovide bespoke enterprise and entrepreneurial training, such as the CDT in Cybersecurity, which\\nincorporates an industrial placement.\\nPromotion of equality and diversity\\nThe Faculty actively fosters and celebrates a diverse body of staff and students by implementing\\nUoB EDI policy and through its own local practices. CS&I is well-known for having\\ndisproportionately male practitioners and we are committed to achieving 30% female\\nrepresentation among staff and students by 2030. CS&I has an international demographic; 21.4%\\nof the Faculty’s academic and research staff have a Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic (BAME)\\nbackground, mainly being overseas staff. Whilst we celebrate our international appeal, we strive to\\nincrease the proportion of academics from the UK BAME community. Among our 62 UoA11\\nacademics, 17.7% identify as female (increase from 9.5% in REF 2014) and 11.3% have a BAME\\nbackground (11.9% in 2014).\\nExamples of our commitment to EDI:\\n    •   Faculty EDI committee established and chaired by the Dean with representatives from\\n        academia, technical and professional services, the student body, LGBT+ community,\\n        unions, Women and Non-binary staff network and the Black Asian and Minority Ethnic staff\\n        network.\\n    •   School EDI Champion (Philamore UoA12) is a member of the SCEEM Senior Management\\n        Team.\\n    •   Needs of staff with caring responsibilities and health issues are accommodated. Part-time\\n        and job-share roles are increasing (two senior staff, one of whom was promoted to\\n        Professor while on a part-time contract). UoB also supports academics returning from part-\\n        time to full-time employment. Research funding (up to £10k) from the Returning Carers\\n        Scheme has supported three academics from UoA11.\\n    •   We shared with all line managers information to support staff returning from family-related\\n        or compassionate leave related to Covid-19, in recognition of the additional challenges\\n        facing staff.\\n                                                                                             Page 16\\n\\n\\n    •  Staff with caring responsibilities can claim additional costs involved in attending\\n       conferences and interviews.\\n    •  A new initiative, ‘Engineering Includes Me’, inspires staff and line managers by\\n       demonstrating the benefits of supporting staff with diverse needs through case studies that\\n       promote flexible working and other support mechanisms.\\n    •  Female representation on all promotion panels helps ensure that time taken for parental\\n       leave or flexible working is properly considered.\\n    •  We actively support participation in the Aurora and Bristol FLI (Female Leaders Initiative)\\n       programmes, as well as the Bristol Women’s Mentoring Network. This enabled SCEEM to\\n       increase the number of female academics in senior leadership positions: Faculty PGT\\n       Education Director (Cater), Associate Dean for Temple Quarter Research & Enterprise\\n       (Liu), Head of Research Group (Roudaut).\\n    •  Set up a system for reporting micro-aggressions, which was superseded by a UoB-wide\\n       report-and-support tool.\\n    •  Created a Women and Non-binary Staff Network for Faculty of Engineering and a network\\n       for BAME staff jointly with the Faculty of Science.\\n    •  Provided trans-awareness training to staff.\\nThe Black Lives Matter movement persuaded us that to effect real and lasting change we must be\\nnot merely neutral (non-racist/non-sexist/non-discriminatory), but actively anti-racist/anti-sexist/anti-\\ndiscriminatory. There is a new appetite within the Faculty to listen to those who have been\\ndisadvantaged as a result of inequality, to take effective action and to make a concerted effort to\\nreduce the number of micro-incivilities that people endure. We are determined to make our\\nprocesses equitable, to make it clear that we value diversity and to make everyone feel welcome in\\nour community.\\nCreating a Positive Working Environment\\nWe want our people to feel valued in their work and to feel supported in managing their own\\nwellbeing as well as their research, impact, and education activities. Our initiatives include:\\nWellbeing:\\n    •  Protected Thursday afternoons: email-free time so staff can prioritise their work.\\n    •  Weekly staff yoga sessions funded by the Faculty.\\n    •  Staff encouraged to sign up to the UoB’s email charter, to lessen the burden of email.\\n    •  Virtual coffee sessions and quizzes during lockdown.\\nSpace and facilities:\\n    •  Wellness room. A lockable room to express milk, breastfeed, pray, or rest (for those with\\n       long-term conditions).\\n    •  A new café space, meeting places, accessible gender-neutral toilets have promoted a\\n       sense of solidarity and inclusivity.\\n    •  New teaching and seminar spaces have triple hearing loops, desk and lectern risers and\\n       automatic doors, making them fully accessible.\\n                                                                                                Page 17\\n\\n\\nCommunity building:\\n    •    Social gatherings are organised within core hours (School meetings, female and non-binary\\n         lunches, morning/afternoon coffee sessions).\\n    •    Family-friendly Faculty parties within core hours.\\nMeetings:\\n    •    All decision-making meetings take place in core hours.\\n    •    A protected slot at monthly School meetings enable staff members to raise issues for\\n         discussion at School level.\\nEDI considerations for REF submission\\nThe REF submission itself was constructed with the primary goal of describing our research\\nexcellence across UoA11. This included the SCEEM Research Committee explaining and\\nsupporting the process for assessing independence to potential PDRA applicants. Heads of Group\\nguided academics in writing the 100-word output statements. Extra unconscious bias training was\\nprovided to the UoA coordinator, and this informed the design of the internal review process for\\noutputs. All review panels were representative of the makeup of staff in SCEEM, including female\\nand BAME academics.\\n 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\nResearch funding and strategies for generating research income\\nUoA11 offers colleagues\\n    •    an excellent physical infrastructure in which to undertake research - one which was\\n         augmented during this REF period by substantial UoB investments\\n    •    an excellent research support infrastructure, for grant winning, industrial collaborations\\nThese features are reflected in a substantially improved grants record and CDT achievements\\nreflecting not only the reputation and quality of our research, but also our success in building new\\ncollaborations around the globe. Our total research income over the REF period was £39m.\\nOur strategy for research funding incorporates:\\n    •    Supporting the vitality of research groups to enable them to develop a strong research\\n         income stream. Each group produces a five-year plan (updated on an annual basis) that is\\n         discussed with the Head of School and School Research Director.\\n    •    Encouraging individuals to apply for externally-funded fellowships to realise their research\\n         vision, from early-career to professorial level, and spanning basic research to\\n         industrial/international secondments.\\n    •    Investing in capital and equipment funding to underpin our current and future ambitions. A\\n         key example is the Research England RPIF bid which secured £29m of capital funding for\\n         BDFI which will be based in TQEC.\\n    •    Maximising the leverage achieved by significant grants by investing in equipment,\\n         academic posts, research support posts, studentships, and technicians. UoB supported the\\n         MyWorld project with £3.7m of investment.

As noted in the REF5a, the RED Partnerships Team provides advice on fellowship\\nand major funding bids, as well as interview training and mock panel interviews, equipment bids\\nand programme grants. When fellowship candidates are invited to interview, RED organises\\ninterview training and mock panels with senior staff. The Faculty’s ESPRC fellowship success rate\\nover the REF period is 36.4% (national success rate is 21%) with seven EPSRC fellowships\\nawarded to UoA11 academics in the REF period, of a total of 18 externally-funded fellowships.\\nIn 2019, the Faculty introduced a formal pre-submission process for grant applications. It ensures\\nthat space, technical and project management support and any funding leverage are agreed by the\\nrelevant senior managers. It also provides all academics with internal peer review, feedback and\\nsupport in writing funding applications, thus ensuring they have been prepared to the highest-\\npossible standard. The ILO includes a team of 44 professionals providing post-award support,\\nincluding project management, for major research activities.\\nInfrastructure and Facilities\\nThe Faculty has enjoyed significant strategic expansion during the REF period with ongoing major\\ninvestment to our estate. A new wing (>£19m) was added to one of the two main Faculty buildings\\nin 2017, enhancing both our teaching and research spaces. Two research groups in UoA11 have\\nmoved into brand new office/research spaces in a newly acquired building in 2019 (1 Cathedral\\nSquare - 1CS), with more groups due to follow. UoB invested more than £1.7m in specialised\\nfacilities for UoA11 in the last six years. 1CS has been upgraded with research facilities, including\\ncomputer vision labs, at a cost of £3.49m. Another building on the campus was repurposed for the\\n                                                                                              Page 20\\n\\n\\nEngineering Mathematics Department and its associated research staff.

Phase 4, featuring in the Top 500 supercomputers in the world in 2016,\\n        includes around 16,000 cores and 64 NVIDIA P100 GPUs resulting in a peak 600 teraflops\\n        of performance. In 2014 Bristol became an Intel Parallel Computing Center (IPCC), the first\\n        such centre in the UK and the seventh worldwide. As part of this initiative, we are working\\n        with Intel to modernise HPC codes so that they are ready for future many-core systems.\\n        This work involved many important contributions from the HPC group, including\\n        development and optimisation of key applications and mini-apps on Intel architectures, to\\n        leverage the advanced technologies of Intel’s Xeon Phi including high-bandwidth memory.\\n     •  The high-performance computer infrastructure (Blue Pebble) runs parallel to BlueCrystal\\n        and supports the centralised purchasing and maintenance of individually-owned computer\\n        resource, allowing research groups and researchers to easily purchase, for example, GPU\\n        nodes without having to dedicate time to set up and run their cluster. This facility is in heavy\\n        use by AI&A, particularly for machine-learning applications.

For\\nexample, the Cybersecurity CDT trains students to develop interdisciplinary approaches to tackle\\nTIPS issues in the large-scale, hyper-connected infrastructures of the future. In the REPHRAIN\\nproject, a cybersecurity toolbox is being developed as a one-stop shared set of resources for\\nresearchers, practitioners, policymakers, regulators, and citizens. This will allow the public to\\ncontribute to a world-first Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) testbed, datasets, benchmarks,\\nreference scenarios and validated novel tools, method and prototypes. VI-Lab is a key partner in\\nBVI, an internationally-leading interdisciplinary collaboration of some 160 researchers across\\ncomputer science, engineering, psychology, biology, medicine and the creative arts.\\nA key part of the research vision for TQEC (see REF5a) is to build on our expertise in application-\\nbased research to pioneer a co-creation and co-production approach across social, computer\\nsciences, engineering and the arts, to bring researchers together with industrial and civic partners\\nto define new methods for sociotechnical innovation and address cross-sector challenges. This is\\nsupported by UoA11’s involvement in flagship activities, such as the CDTs, BDFI, MyWorld, and\\nREPHRAIN. Special facilities will be constructed in the next two years, including a co-creation\\nresearch arena, public engagement spaces, and a reality emulator to enable sociotechnical\\nresearch at realistic conditions and scale. These facilities are complemented by a Digital Health\\nhub (to support ‘in the wild’ testing of devices and systems) and an immersive auditorium for large\\nscale audience experience evaluation,

      "['University of Dundee\\n  Unit of Assessment: UoA11 Computer Science and Informatics\\n  1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n1.1 Unit Structure and Context\\nUoA11 research is structured as four clusters (each with a lead, underlined):\\n     • Argument Technology (ARG-tech) (Lawrence, Pease, Reed, Visser) focuses on\\n         theoretical and practical aspects of argumentation and artificial intelligence.\\n     • Computing Theory & Methodologies (CTM) (Edwards, Fiadeiro, Janjic) spans parallelism\\n         and data science, graph theory, and formal software system modelling and analysis.\\n     • Computer Vision & Image Processing (CVIP) (Magerand, Martin, McKenna, Trucco)\\n         develops and applies visual data analysis and machine learning for biomedical, space\\n         exploration, and vision applications.\\n     • Human-Centred Computing (HCC) (Crabb, Rough, Waller) research includes\\n         Augmentative & Alternative Communication (AAC) and User Experience (UX).\\nTogether these form the Computing Sciences research theme, one of four overarching themes in\\nthe School of Science and Engineering which spans UoA10, UoA11 and UoA12. Researchers can\\naffiliate with multiple clusters from across the University to facilitate inter-cluster working and build\\ncapacity beyond the core disciplines.\\nThe Unit’s vision to enable significant societal benefits through its research articulates clearly with\\nthe University’s mission “to transform lives, locally and globally through the creation, sharing and\\napplication of knowledge”. Unit staff have taken and will continue to take lead roles in research and\\nimpact aligned with the University’s interdisciplinary themes, most obviously those of Innovating\\nTechnology and Health and Wellbeing. The Unit benefits from interdisciplinary collaborations\\nacross the University and beyond, embracing the institution’s strategic priority of embedding\\ninterdisciplinarity to build a vibrant research culture that delivers impact.\\n1.2 Research Objectives and Plans during the Period\\nThe Unit’s vision at REF2014 was to be a world-leading centre of research excellence in its areas\\nof specialisation, enabling societal benefits through research. REF2014 aims and plans were:\\n1. To develop critical mass in focused specialisms, driven by strong connections to research users.\\nIt planned to grow sustainably, strengthening existing specialisms and cross-cluster synergies.\\nThe Unit strengthened its specialisms in ARG-tech, CVIP, and HCC through recruitment of early\\ncareer Category A staff. Cross-cluster synergies were strengthened through joint EPSRC projects\\nbetween HCC and ARG-tech (BESiDE, £1.3M, 2013-17), and between HCC and CVIP (ACE-LP,\\n£1.0M, 2016-20). These clusters have strong connections to research users as exemplified by\\nthose projects’ partners, and by user pools maintained by HCC (see 4.2). The CTM cluster was\\nformed to consolidate research in that area. The Unit saw 15% growth in Category A FTE.\\n2. To ensure stable research income from a diverse funding base.\\nTotal research income was £11.45M. This was from 39 different sources including EPSRC, NERC,\\nBBSRC, EU, Space Agencies, BBC, Google, Microsoft, and CRUK (3.1). Mentoring helped\\nachieve grant success, e.g. Pease’s EPSRC First Grant.\\n                                                                                                   Page 1\\n\\n\\n3. To grow Postgraduate Researcher (PGR) numbers, increasing student staff ratio to 2:1 by\\nboosting international recruitment of high-quality candidates, leveraging research networks, new\\nagreements, and rolling recruitment.\\nThere are currently 22 PGR students with primary supervisors in Computing and another 10 co-\\nsupervised with other disciplines, a 2.3:1 ratio of supervisions to category A staff. PhD applications\\nare now triaged and managed on a continual basis by Computing’s PGR Lead. PhD funding was\\nsought through industry with funding provided by Toshiba, NIDEK Technologies Srl, and Optos plc.\\nduring the period. Students were also funded by EPSRC, the Scottish Imaging Network\\n(SINAPSE), and the Scottish Informatics & Computer Science Alliance (SICSA) research pool.\\n4. To harness and build coherence through awareness raising and enhanced collaboration in areas\\nof local strength where there are natural synergies, e.g. Health Informatics, Clinical Imaging, Life\\nSciences, Art & Design.\\nCVIP raised awareness through involvement in the Academic Health Science Partnership between\\nUoD and NHS Tayside, for example, leading to enhanced collaboration with the School of\\nMedicine aligned to the UoD themes of Health and Wellbeing and Innovating Technology. In health\\ninformatics and imaging, CVIP has key roles (co-investigators, work package leaders, committee\\nmembers) in large and strategic projects, e.g., Health Data Research UK (HDR-UK, £4M first-\\ntranche funding, 2018), the £3.8M MRC/EPSRC PICTURES Programme Grant, the £7M NIHR\\nGlobal Health Unit Dundee-Chennai INSPIRED project, UoD’s Health Informatics Centre, and the\\nScottish National Safe Haven project. An example of synergy with Life Sciences is the £1.3M MRC\\nproject Dynamics of Fundamental Cellular Processes by Live Cell and Tissue Imaging.\\n5. To seek new high-value international partnerships with leading research institutes reflecting the\\nUnit’s research strengths, to encourage visits and exchanges with leading labs, and further raise\\nthe Unit’s profile by organising/hosting conferences.\\nThe Unit has been highly active in achieving these aims by (i) building collaborations with key\\npartners including the Universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, UCL, Duke, Göttingen, Harvard, and\\nTwente, (ii) undertaking visits, e.g. to University of Konstanz (Reed, Senior Fellowship), University\\nof Göttingen, Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences (Pease), Chinese Academy of\\nSciences (Trucco), (iii) hosting research visits, e.g. from SICSA Distinguished Visiting Fellows,\\nand (iv) hosting meetings and organising conferences, e.g. European Conference on Computer\\nVision general and poster Chairs (Trucco, McKenna), COMMA Co-Chair (Reed), ASSETS User\\nExperience Chair (Waller), Future of Assistive Technology Conference Invited Chair (Waller), and\\nRoyal Society Science+ meeting Chair (Trucco).\\n6. To enhance monitoring, governance, and management of research and strategy.\\nThese aspects have undergone major reorganisation and are now coordinated by the School\\nResearch and Knowledge Exchange Committee, as described in 3.2. It oversees an Annual\\nResearch Review of all aspects of the Unit’s research and impact.\\nCluster-level plans stated at REF2014 were:\\n     o  ARG-tech aimed to contribute to cultural wellbeing by developing critical literacy through\\n        research in debate and argument, partnering with organisations such as the BBC.\\nAs detailed in a REF Impact Case Study, the BBC commissioned ARG-tech to produce the\\nEvidence Toolkit, challenging young people to spot \"fake news\" and illustrating how to recognise\\nclaims and evidence; founded upon the world’s first public deployment of argument mining, into\\nover 3000 schools, it has influenced UK and EU policy. Building on this foundation, ARG-tech\\n                                                                                                Page 2\\n\\n\\nsecured COVID-19 funding (ESRC, £94k to UoD) to tackle fake news around Coronavirus. It is\\nnow partnering with the Universities of Konstanz and Göttingen on argument technology-based\\ninterventions to augment and enhance deliberative democracy in partnership with Scottish and\\nGerman governments.\\n    o   CVIP aimed to emphasise biomedical image analysis with application to translational and\\n        stratified medicine, focusing on high-incidence conditions. Space research aimed to\\n        increase the number and value of missions to which its software is critical, as well as\\n        providing a near-Earth observation service consistently top-rated by NERC.\\nRenewed emphasis on biomedical image analysis led to strengthened interdisciplinary\\ncollaborations in applied and translational research. Major projects investigating the role of retinal\\nand brain image analysis focused on high-incidence conditions such as vascular dementia\\n(EPSRC, £1.1M with UoD School of Medicine and University of Edinburgh), personalised medicine\\nfor diabetes (NIHR, with UoD School of Medicine and Dr Mohan’s Speciality Diabetes Centres,\\nIndia), and profiling diabetic cardiomyopathy (contribution to £10M CARDIATEAM, EU Innovative\\nMedicines Initiative). Interdisciplinary initiatives included research on ophthalmology (NIDEK Co.\\nLtd. Technologies grant), digital pathology (EPSRC studentship, with UoD Pathology), HDR-UK\\n(with UoD School of Medicine and University of Edinburgh), profiling lipoproteins linked to\\ncardiovascular disease (with University of St Andrews) and screening pathologies in the food\\nindustry (BBSRC/Innovate UK with Newcastle University, Tulip Ltd., Hellenic Systems Ltd.). The\\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) continues to fund (€1m since 2014) the Unit’s research on its\\nPlanet and Asteroid Natural Scene Generation Utility (PANGU), a tool for testing and developing\\nspace navigation and guidance systems. Its impact is detailed in an Impact Case Study; it is critical\\nto multiple missions including the ESA ExoMars Rover and Surface Platform Mission, the ESA-\\nNASA Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment programme’s HERACLES mission, and the\\nESA Phootprint mission. The Dundee Satellite Receiving Station provided its top-rated near-Earth\\nobservation service with NERC funding until 2019.\\n    o   HCC aimed to expand and capitalise on its research in areas of high impact and national\\n        priority; its work on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) and Digital Social\\n        Inclusion impacting directly on social, cultural and physical wellbeing.\\nHCC’s reputation and high impact was nationally recognised with Waller receiving an OBE for\\nservices to people with complex communication needs. Its AAC research received EPSRC funding\\non the use of context to improve communication for users of voice output communication aids\\n(£1M with CVIP, University of Cambridge, and others). Capitalising on the Social Inclusion in the\\nDigital Economy hub with Newcastle University, HCC won further EPSRC funding, enabling\\nresearch into understanding wellbeing within care home environments (BESiDE, £1.3M with\\nNewcastle University, Balhousie Care Group, Heathfield Residential Home Ltd., Collective\\nArchitecture Ltd., and BUPA). The group’s work aimed to impact accessibility through research into\\ncolour identification systems for people with colour vision deficiency (ColourSpecs: £100k with\\nNorwegian University of Science and Technology); tools for accessible table discussion (Scottish\\nFunding Council, with Ideas for Ears); and accessible interaction techniques (Carnegie Trust, with\\nBBC R&D and Rochester Institute of Technology).\\n1.3 Research and Impact Objectives for the Next Five Years\\nThe Unit will continue to compete effectively by focusing on excelling at research in its specific\\nareas of strength. Each of the Unit’s specialisms, as well as being internationally leading, should\\nbe positioned to contribute in unique and important ways to collaborative research projects in its\\n                                                                                                Page 3\\n\\n\\narea. Cluster research plans will continue to support vitality and sustainability of multiple areas of\\nimpact (3.1), including PANGU space technology (CVIP) and argument technology in the public\\nsphere (ARG-tech), as detailed in the Impact Case Studies.\\nARG-tech will apply its techniques to real-world applications of argumentation and AI in domains\\nsuch as healthcare, academic collaboration, intelligence & defence, law, and democracy. It will\\ndeliver new foundational results in philosophy and linguistics (theoretical and computational), and\\nforge new deployments for both professional and general audiences.\\nCTM will address foundational, methodological, and architectural aspects of modern computing\\nsystems, whose complexity arises from high levels of distribution and connectivity that can change\\nover time, bringing them closer to the dynamical systems found in, say, biological or social\\nsystems. It will develop tools and methodologies for structured, formalised high-level programming\\nof massively parallel hardware, while addressing the pressing issues of performance versus\\nenergy consumption (green computing) and application security for modern hardware systems.\\nHCC will leverage its track record in designing for diverse users and situations to understand and\\naddress challenges that exist when people use technology to actively participate in society. Work\\nwill focus on enabling digital participation with a focus on complex human limitation and equally\\ncomplex environmental considerations. HCC will increase multidisciplinary collaborations,\\ncombining skills from researchers in computing, psychology, design, medicine, and business.\\nCVIP will collaborate to leverage big data from Scotland\\'s national medical imaging archive to\\ndevelop new AI tools for disease diagnosis and risk prediction. CVIP will increase intra-School\\ncollaboration with colleagues in Mathematical Sciences and Engineering & Physical Sciences. Its\\nspace technology research will continue to focus on surface modelling and simulation for vision-\\nbased guidance and navigation.\\n1.4 Facilitating Impact and Interdisciplinary Research\\nThe Unit runs a seminar series with external speakers and encourages research visitors (4.1). It is\\nan active member of the Scottish Informatics & Computer Science Alliance (SICSA), a research\\npool funded by the Scottish Funding Council comprising 14 computing ‘departments’ across\\nScotland. It thus benefits from SICSA’s research themes, funding support, graduate academy\\ntraining activities and knowledge exchange events. For example, staff are encouraged to present\\nat the annual SICSA DemoFest, showcasing the best Computing research from Scotland’s\\nUniversities to private and public sector organisations. Most of the Unit’s research involves\\ninterdisciplinarity; researchers can affiliate with multiple research clusters in a way that is not tied to\\ndiscipline.\\nStrategic research retreats for staff and students, supported through the School’s Research Fund,\\nprovide opportunities to engage in strategy refinement. For example, CVIP ran annual summer\\nworkshops at a country hotel and winter workshops away from the Computing building over the\\nentire REF period, at which all cluster staff and students presented research and planned joint\\nworking. ARG-tech’s annual retreat focuses on creative thinking around new problems; the 2017\\nedition led to successful application to Dstl/DASA for Dialogical Fingerprinting (£94k) in 2019. PhD\\nstudents and post-docs get involved in impact activities including award-winning public\\nengagement (see Black in 4.2) and industrial liaison (see Gemechu in 2.2), and a strategic aim is\\nto increase this further. The Unit encourages and facilitates public engagement as described in 4.2.\\n                                                                                                  Page 4\\n\\n\\nThe School’s Associate Dean for Industrial Engagement provides leadership on engagement with\\nindustrial partners and organisations, supporting its ambition to be a preferred partner in the\\neconomic and social progress of the city, the region, and beyond. This includes creating and\\ngrowing partnerships, developing opportunities for industry-led research and consultancy, and\\nencouraging pathways for impact and commercialisation. The Unit works closely with UoD’s\\nResearch and Innovation Services which provides advice on routes to impact, exploitation options,\\nand industry engagement and commercialisation.\\nThe Unit convenes an Industrial Advisory Board whose roles include provision of a network of\\ncontacts, assisting with research collaborations, and advising on commercialisation and impact\\nactivities. Chaired by Drew Bryce (Bluebox Aviation Systems Ltd.), it has members from IBM,\\nNCR, ScotlandIS, Edesix, Contact Engine, and Circle IT. The Unit also engages with companies\\ninvolved in the School’s Graduate Apprenticeship work-based degree programmes, which include\\na degree in software development.\\n1.5 Open Research Environment\\nSignificant progress towards an open research environment has been made, leveraging UoD’s\\nLibrary and Learning Centre (LLC) and Discovery Repository to ensure open access compliance.\\nStandard practice for the Unit is to deposit all research publications, including those not in scope of\\nREF policy, in this repository. Staff serve on editorial boards of open access journals (4.4).\\nLLC advises on data management planning and compliance with funders’ open data policies.\\nDatasets arising from the Unit’s research have been published (with DOIs) as open data,\\nsometimes where this was not a requirement, e.g. 50 Salads for evaluation of activity recognition\\nalgorithms, Recorded Observation in Care Homes from the BESiDE project, plant-soil data from\\nthe Grow Observatory European citizen science project. HCC made workshop material and\\nsoftware associated with ACM CHI publications available (CC BY-SA 4.0). All data published by\\nthe Unit has been published using CC-BY licenses, facilitating re-use.\\nARG-tech’s open infrastructure for hosting and managing argumentation datasets (AIFdb,\\nwww.aifdb.org) has been used to develop corpora by teams in France, Germany, Poland, Spain,\\nPortugal, the Netherlands, Russia and the US. As a result it supports the world’s largest collection\\nof argumentation datasets. With metadata and permalink guarantees in place, the infrastructure\\naims to mint its own DOIs. ARG-tech software includes the openly accessible Argument Mining\\nFramework (amf.arg.tech), argument translation and evaluation web services (ws.arg.tech), and\\nthe world’s most widely used argument analysis tools: OVA (ova.arg.tech) with over 100,000 users\\nin 80 countries (Google analytics). Most components are released LGPL or CC-BY-SA, with\\nderivatives then developed, e.g. of OVA at University of Trier and of AIFdb at Dstl.\\n1.6 Research integrity\\nThe School has a Research Integrity Lead, supported by a Deputy. They are responsible for\\npromoting a culture of research integrity in the School and provide (i) an independent point of\\ncontact for staff and research students outside their immediate research environment, (ii) impartial\\nadvice on responsible conduct of research, and (iii) advice on making misconduct allegations.\\nResearch staff and students are provided with online video-based training in Responsible and\\nEthical Practice in Research and Publication which is mandatory for research students and new\\nsupervisors. Additional workshops from an external trainer are provided by UoD’s Organisational\\nand Professional Development (OPD) unit. Ethical review and approval of non-clinical research\\ninvolving human participants proposed by staff and students is overseen by the School Research\\n                                                                                                 Page 5\\n\\n\\nEthics Committee. It reports to the University Research Ethics Committee, which provides\\noversight, monitoring and guidance.\\n  2. People\\n2.1 Staffing strategy and staff development\\nIn addition to the 13.5 FTE returned staff, UoA11’s wider research community includes research\\nassistants, research students, technical support, and staff who engage with research to inform\\nteaching.\\nComputing is committed to recruiting researchers with outstanding research track records and\\npotential for achievement at the highest level. The Unit recruited from high profile international\\ninstitutions such as ETH Zurich, Chapel Hill North Carolina, and CTU Prague. Appointment of\\nMagerand (2019) to CVIP, Crabb (2018) and Rough (2020) to HCC, and Lawrence (2019) and\\nVisser (2019) to ARG-tech, helped maintain or build capacity in those clusters. Janjic (2019) was\\nrecruited to strengthen capacity in data science, working across clusters, especially around\\nparallelism and medical big data. Fiadeiro (2019), who researches formal software system\\nmodelling and analysis, was appointed as Dean of the School of Science & Engineering.\\nDemographic profile is well balanced after healthy recent intake of early career academics, thereby\\nsupporting succession planning. Five professors (distributed across clusters, one of whom is\\nDean), two senior lecturers, and seven lecturers make up the Category A staff, all of whom are on\\npermanent contracts. The age profile is 20-29: 7%, 30-39: 36%, 40-49: 21%, 50-59: 29%, >60: 7%.\\nStrategy for recruitment and growth is aligned with clusters, allowing for cross-discipline\\nappointments. New teaching programmes will enable expansion following this REF period. HCC\\nhas already grown by a further 2 FTE since the REF census date with the appointment of a Senior\\nLecturer and a Lecturer (both on Teaching & Research contracts) in Assistive Technology. A new\\nappointment (1 FTE) in networks and sensors is also being made.\\nThe Associate Dean for Research sits on all shortlisting and appointment panels for roles that\\ninclude significant research responsibilities. The appointment process usually runs over two days\\nto ensure candidates interact with staff in relevant clusters and become familiar with the research\\nstructure before interview.\\nAll research active academic staff undergo an Annual Research Review, in addition to the annual\\nObjective Setting and Review process. These supportive processes prompt reflection and\\nguidance regarding research goals, achievements and challenges. Given multiple new academic\\nstaff, mentoring and development are critical for the Unit. Early Career Researchers (ECRs) are\\nprovided with a tailored programme of support to prepare them for leadership and are assigned a\\nmentor (a senior academic in an aligned research area) whom they meet regularly. They are also\\nenrolled on postgraduate training for teaching and learning in Higher Education. The Unit is\\ncommitted to the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. Its staff benefit\\nfrom UoD’s researcher development programme including courses mapped to the Vitae\\nResearcher Development Framework.\\nSenior staff provide mock panels and pre-reviewing of proposal drafts/rebuttals. Staff who have\\nheld fellowships mentor new applicants during fellowship proposal drafting. Staff are regularly\\nbriefed on appropriate funding opportunities using RESEARCHconnect. Individual staff research\\nactivities, such as travel and networking, are supported at School level by a Research Fund\\n                                                                                                Page 6\\n\\n\\napproved by the Research Committee, with priority given to ECRs. All staff align their research\\ninterests with at least one research cluster, and thereby become incorporated in group activities\\n(e.g., reading groups, postgraduate supervision, group funding applications). The Workload\\nAllocation Model protects research time; newly appointed academic staff on teaching and research\\ncontracts are allocated reduced teaching workloads. Cluster Lead roles are recognised in the\\nmodel, as is PGR supervision, time on external research projects and impact generating activities\\nsuch as consultancy and service work, meaning that the teaching and non-research project-\\nsupervision load is balanced across all staff taking into account these research commitments.\\nThese come on top of a baseline research allocation to support generation of new avenues of\\nresearch and strong contribution to the wider academic community.\\nUoD sabbatical leave may be granted to staff who have served three years or more, at the rate of\\none semester per three years of service. Staff are encouraged to fund research sabbaticals\\nthrough external funding. Reed secured £40k funding as part of DFG’s Cluster of Excellence in the\\nPolitics of Inequality for a 5-month visiting senior fellowship at University of Konstanz. McKillop\\n(Research Assistant) spent a month at University of Göttingen furthering collaboration with political\\nscientist Gold; post-doc Snaith made extended visits to Roessingh Research & Development in the\\nNetherlands.\\n2.2 Research students\\nAll PhD students are provided with computer equipment and individual desk space in the most\\nrelevant lab. Privileges they share with staff include 24-hour access and a shared staff common\\nroom. They are welcome at Computing staff meetings. PhD students are expected to contribute to\\nregular cluster and project meetings and encouraged to interact in a spirit of collaboration and\\nsharing with other students and researchers. They often assist with supervision of MSc and\\nundergraduate projects related to their research.\\nUoD procedures and practices for postgraduate research are supplemented by the School’s own\\nPostgraduate Research Guide. All doctoral students are allocated two supervisors with further\\nsupervision from collaborating academics in the case of interdisciplinary research. Each student\\nmeets twice a year with two members of academic staff other than their supervisors as part of the\\nThesis Monitoring Committee programme to discuss achievements, goals, and individual\\ndevelopment plans. This provides an opportunity to raise concerns (e.g. regarding supervision or\\naccess to resources) and contributes to a documented portfolio of progress. Students can also\\nseek guidance from the Computing PGR Lead and the School’s PGR Director (who is a member of\\nthe board of the UoD Doctoral Academy). Students transfer formally to the PhD programme after\\ntheir first year, having satisfied an examining committee based on a report (including plan),\\npresentation, mandatory research integrity training, and oral examination.\\nAll research students are encouraged to present at high quality international and national\\nconferences, and to attend relevant summer schools. Financial support for this is provided by the\\nSchool’s Research Fund and the Discipline of Computing’s budget. Students benefit from the\\nenvironment provided by SICSA with its seminars, masterclasses, conferences and funding\\nopportunities, e.g. there have been 36 UoD PhD student attendees at SICSA PhD Conferences\\n(2014-19), a student representative on its organising committee, and SICSA summer school\\nsponsorship and bursary support. OPD’s Researcher Development Programme provides training\\nsuitable for Computing PhD students including workshops covering PhD Launchpad (year 1),\\nMaking Progress in Your PhD (year 2), Finish Up, Move on (year 3), Career Options, Researcher\\nWellbeing and Mental Health, EDI, and research ethics. Bespoke training (e.g. in statistics) and\\n                                                                                                 Page 7\\n\\n\\ngraduate school events provide further opportunities for development. Research clusters run\\nregular journal clubs, at which staff and students meet to review research together.\\nThe School supports an annual two-day Computing PhD Symposium organised and chaired by\\nPhD students with two senior academics acting as advisors. It features student-edited proceedings\\nand student-selected keynotes/panels on, e.g. open data, publishing, and ‘life after the viva’. All\\nstudents are required to participate each year by reviewing extended abstracts and giving a talk on\\ntheir research. Annual prizes are given to reward the best first-year student presentation and the\\nbest overall PhD student.\\nThe quality of PhD education is evidenced by external awards to students, e.g. Best Student Paper\\nAwards at European Conference on Argumentation (Visser, 2015) and Computational Models of\\nArgument (Duthie, 2016), EPSRC UK ICT Pioneers Finalist (Stein, 2014). PhD students are\\nencouraged to participate in public engagement activities and spend time as research interns or\\nvisiting researchers in companies or labs elsewhere to broaden their experience, e.g. Duthie and\\nMcKillop visited University of Konstanz; Akbar was research intern at Toshiba Medical\\nVisualization Systems; Gemechu was appointed Industrial Fellow in Residence, funded by Contact\\nEngine. The quality of PhD training provided by staff is evidenced by their invited contributions to\\ndoctoral training and summer schools (4.3).\\nThe Unit strives to balance retaining talented local graduates and attracting students from\\nelsewhere. UoD receives an EPSRC Doctoral Training Award used to competitively fund\\nstudentships in the School, in some cases with staff securing matched funding externally.\\nStudentships are also funded by industry and other organisations (1.2).\\n2.3 Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI)\\nThe School is committed to the Athena SWAN charter principles, holds an Athena SWAN Bronze\\nAward (since 2018) and is working towards a Silver Award application in 2022. Its Athena SWAN\\nself-assessment committee, led by Computing academic Murray, focuses on actions that maintain\\nand enhance inclusive culture and collegiate working practices. School and University-level EDI\\nand Athena SWAN action plans guide ongoing improvements in support of all staff and students;\\nthese are informed by the University\\'s biennial staff survey.\\nStaff in the Unit can access a range of University work-life balance policies including coverage for\\nthose with changed circumstances, compassionate leave, parental leave (including shared),\\nadoption/fostering leave, carer\\'s leave, and fertility treatment leave. Computing’s Discipline Lead\\nmaintains regular contact with staff during their leave. Discussions related to return to work,\\nincluding requests for reductions in FTE, are held prior to return in line with UoD’s Flexible Working\\nPolicy. The Unit can be flexible in transitioning staff to/from part-time working; job sharing and\\nflexible/phased retirement are also supported. During lockdown, staff and research students were\\nsupported to work effectively from home, and computational resources were fully accessible to\\nsupport remote working on research. Voluntary declaration of any mitigating circumstances is part\\nof the standard academic promotions process.\\nThe Unit appoints staff and recruits research students on merit alone and is committed to equality\\nand diversity. Staff appointing and shortlisting panels are gender balanced. Online training in\\nequality and diversity is mandatory for staff and includes modules on Diversity in the Workplace,\\nDisability, Diversity in Learning and Teaching, Stress in the Workplace, and A Manager’s Guide to\\nStress. Additionally, a Recruitment and Selection module is taken by staff involved in those\\nactivities. Unconscious bias training sessions are available to all in the School. A full-time\\n                                                                                                 Page 8\\n\\n\\ncounsellor for mental-health issues has recently been appointed and has supported staff and\\nstudents with caring responsibilities and other needs during the Covid-19 pandemic. Harassment\\nadvisers are available for staff and students.\\nStaff from the Unit organised and hosted the SICSA Women in Computing Research event\\n(Pease, Komendantskaya, 2016). Pease is joint leader for the SICSA theme Supporting and\\nRecruiting Women in Computing. Strong female role models in the Unit during the period include\\nComputing’s Discipline Lead (Waller, OBE) who was born with cerebral palsy, and the President of\\nthe ACM (Hanson, FRSE).\\n2.4 Preparation of the REF Submission\\nIn preparing this submission, the Unit’s Planning Group was guided by the University’s REF 2021\\nCode of Practice, framing its decision-making process in the context of the principles of equality,\\ndiversity, and inclusion. The Planning Group made decisions on outputs and attributions in a\\nmanner that aimed to maximise the overall quality profile, based on a thorough process of internal\\nand external evaluation. All staff were invited to propose potential Impact Case Studies. The\\nsubmitted Impact Case Studies reflect the Planning Group’s view of the strongest demonstrable\\nresearch impacts in the reporting period. All Planning Group members completed EDI and\\nInformation Security training modules, and REF-specific training in Equality & Diversity including\\nUnconscious Bias training, prior to the decision-making process.\\n 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n3.1 Research Funding\\nThe Unit attracted £11.45M in research funding over the period. In addition to published outputs,\\nthis funding led to significant impact, including enabling aspects of the Impact Case Studies.\\nSpecifically, research underpinning the PANGU case study was supported by the European Space\\nAgency (ESA) PANGU-4: Planet and Asteroid Natural Scene Generation Utility Tool Enhancement\\nproject (Grant to UoD £494k. Martin, Parkes). The EPSRC-funded project Argument Mining\\n(£680k. Sole investigator: Reed) underpinned the Argument Technology case study. Further\\nfunding for ARG-tech included £671k from Dstl (Mar 2019-Mar 2021) on applications of argument\\ntechnology to intelligence analysis. Academics in the HCC and CVIP clusters led further major\\nEPSRC-funded projects:\\n    •    ACE-LP: Augmenting Communication using Environmental Data-driven Language\\n         Prediction. £1M. Waller (PI), McKenna, Zhang. Partners: University of Cambridge\\n         (Kristensson), Arria NLG Ltd, Edesix Ltd, Scope, Capability Scotland, Communication\\n         Matters, National Museum of Scotland, Ninewells Hospital & Medical School, Sensory\\n         Software International Ltd, Tobii Dynavox. (Ranked number one at the ‘User Interaction\\n         with ICT’ prioritisation panel).\\n    •    Multi-modal retinal biomarkers for vascular dementia. £923k, Unit income £313k. Trucco\\n         (PI), McKenna. Collaborators: UoD School of Medicine (Doney), Edinburgh Centre for\\n         Clinical Brain Sciences and Centre for Cognitive Ageing & Cognitive Epidemiology (Deary,\\n         Dhillon, Doubal, MacGillivray, Wardlaw).\\n    •    BESiDE: Built Environment for Social Inclusion in the Digital Economy. £1.3M. Hanson (PI),\\n         Reed. Collaborators: UoD Art & Design (Lim, White), UoD School of Medicine (McMurdo),\\n         Newcastle University (Watson). Partners: Balhousie Care Group, BUPA, Collective\\n         Architecture Ltd, Healthfield Residential Home Ltd.\\n                                                                                               Page 9\\n\\n\\nGrants obtained as part of major international consortia included:\\n    •   COUCH: Council of Coaches. EU H2020. Grant to UoD: £416k. Pease. Collaborators: UoD\\n        School of Medicine (Conway, Wake). Partners: University of Twente, Roessingh Research\\n        & Development BV, Danish Board of Technology Foundation, University Pierre and Marie\\n        Curie, Polytechnic University of Valencia, Innovation Sprint.\\n    •   INSPIRED: India-Scotland Partnership for Precision Medicine in Diabetes. NIHR Global\\n        Health Research Unit (£7M, PI: Colin Palmer, School of Medicine). Trucco leads the\\n        Retinome package. Income to Unit: £852k.\\nSustainable research income generation will target interdisciplinary, challenge-based research in\\nareas where the Unit is well placed to lead or provide critical input. For example, CVIP will leverage\\nopportunities provided by the scale and nature of medical data resources available through\\ncollaborations in Tayside (e.g. GoDarts: Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research; SHARE:\\nScottish Health Research Register) and strong links nationally (UK Biobank) and internationally\\n(e.g. 0.5M patients in India via INSPIRED), building on extensive collaborative networks and long\\nexperience of interdisciplinary biomedical research to target research questions that require large-\\nscale data and high quality consortia. As a current example, Trucco is computing investigator on\\nthe UoD-led PICTURES programme (2019-2024), a £3.8M consortium with the Universities of\\nEdinburgh and Abertay, NHS Scotland, and industry, funded through MRC/EPSRC as part of\\nHDR-UK. ARG-tech will grow funding based on its reputation for techniques in argument mining\\n(surveyed by Lawrence and Reed in Computational Linguistics, 2020) and its applications\\nincluding intelligence analysis.\\nA key target for 2021-23 is to secure funding for ECRs; submission of a New Investigator Award\\nproposal is a minimum expectation for ECRs (Pease won her EPSRC First Grant during the\\nperiod), and applications for externally-funded personal Fellowship support are strongly\\nencouraged. Internal peer review of proposals and responses to reviewers, as well as mock\\ninterview panels, involving fellowship holders, and Research Council panel and college members,\\ntogether with proposal development support from Research & Innovation Services, will help ensure\\nbids of the highest quality. There will be a focus on fellowship funding at all levels including UKRI\\nand charitable sources.\\nThe Unit will take opportunities with colleagues and collaborating institutions, working with the\\nDoctoral Academy, to bid for large scale Doctoral Training initiatives. It will harness its Industrial\\nAdvisory Board in planning how to better marshal and leverage its many successful commercial\\ncollaborations, to win service and industrial research funds, and to enhance its impact.\\n3.2 Organisational and Operational Infrastructure\\nHuman Infrastructure\\nResearch clusters deliver the strategic research directions of the School. They inform staff\\nrecruitment, coordinate ECR mentoring and training, organise seminars, and coordinate peer-\\nreview of grant applications and mock-interviews for fellowship applications, drawing on expertise\\nacross UoD. They also serve as interfaces with other schools in the University for inter- or multi-\\ndisciplinary research.\\nManagement structures in which the Unit operates were reorganised in 2015 with formation of the\\nSchool of Science and Engineering. Management and monitoring of research and impact, and\\nsharing of best practice, are now coordinated by the School Research & Knowledge Exchange\\nCommittee whose membership includes the Computing Research Lead and PGR Lead. It is\\n                                                                                                Page 10\\n\\n\\nchaired by the Associate Dean for Research who is a member of the University Research &\\nKnowledge Exchange Committee as well as other groups convened by the Vice-Principal\\n(Research) for defining or monitoring implementation of University-wide strategic objectives. The\\nAssociate Dean meets staff individually for monitoring, planning, and scoping of opportunities as\\npart of the Annual Research Review process. Together with target setting at Objective Setting and\\nReview meetings, and research cluster meetings, this helps keep ambition levels high for the Unit’s\\nresearch activities, environment, outputs, and impact.\\nThe School Research Administrative Lead coordinates a team supporting the research-driven\\nculture. This includes (i) collating and analysing data relevant to Annual Research Reviews and\\nother research activity; (ii) supporting adherence to Open Access and Open Data policies; (iii)\\ndisseminating research funding opportunities using RESEARCHconnect; (iv) ensuring effective\\nsupport is in place for costing research proposals (pre-award); and (v) liaising with Research\\nFinance Services over creation of grant administration structures and cost centres (post-award).\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure\\nThe Queen Mother Building (QMB) was purpose-built for Computing and designed to be fully\\naccessible. Space in QMB is organised to co-locate cluster members, achieving a working\\nenvironment, in which cognate researchers, from PhD students to professorial staff, are in close\\nphysical proximity, facilitating collaboration. QMB was designed to allow a fourth floor to be added,\\na cost-effective option for expansion that would maintain co-location and cohesion.\\nThe QMB received further investment during the period. It has been part of a university-wide £7M\\nnetwork upgrade project delivering a gigabit network to the desktop. Additionally, a dedicated\\nfirewall solution that caters for Computing’s requirements has been implemented to satisfy Cyber\\nEssentials requirements. Furthermore, the server infrastructure has seen hardware upgrades with\\nsome storage being transferred from traditional magnetic HDD to SSD technology at a cost of\\naround £8k. Overall maintenance and improvement of services such as web and database hosting\\nfor the research portfolio, and new investment into GPU-driven processing, cost approximately\\n£50k. The Unit’s research is currently aided by a School support team of 3 FTE administrative and\\n1 FTE specialist support staff who work closely with centralised IT support (UoDIT).\\nComputing operates a hardware/software investment cycle to ensure staff have up-to-date\\nresources. Software requirements are also gathered on a continuous basis to support research. All\\nresearch students and staff have access to a wide range of software including Visual Studio\\nEnterprise, MATLAB (with over 40 toolboxes), CUDA and Python in-house. Computing has\\ninvested in shared GPU servers and desktops that have greatly facilitated deep learning research\\nby staff and students in CVIP and ARG-tech with support from Nvidia and from research funds.\\nThe loan of a Nvidia DGX server and storage solution was an example of Nvidia’s support. Staff\\ncan also access the University’s centrally supported High-Performance Computing facilities.\\nThe QMB User Testing Lab has been renovated, providing state-of-the-art AV recording and eye-\\ntracking capabilities within an HCI testing environment, and HCC has set up dedicated prototyping\\nspace for Virtual/Augmented Reality research with equipment such as HTC Vive Pro, Microsoft\\nHololens, and Sony Xperia Touch (c. £50k investment). QMB houses the User Centre, a unique\\nresource hosting user groups who meet regularly to learn about technology and take part in\\nresearch (4.2).\\nThe Unit benefits from investment across UoD to support its interdisciplinary strengths. Dundee\\nInterdisciplinary and Innovation Forum events included Artificial Intelligence, Health Informatics,\\n                                                                                              Page 11\\n\\n\\nand Health and Wellbeing: Ageing Society. The University’s Health Informatics Centre (HIC) has\\nan ISO27001 certified environment, part of a federated Scottish network of Safe Havens, and\\ndevelops a Research Data Management Platform to manage, anonymise, and extract images\\nlinked to health data, to support over 1.5 Petabytes of routinely collected radiological imaging data.\\nCVIP is collaborating in this effort and will continue to work with HIC to leverage this infrastructure\\nto develop algorithms for diagnostics, risk prediction, and discovery. CVIP’s research on digital\\npathology benefits from the Tayside Biorepository secure tissue bank.\\n  4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society\\n4.1 Support for and Effectiveness of Research Collaborations and Networks\\nUnit staff collaborated productively with UK Universities (e.g. Cambridge, Edinburgh, Newcastle,\\nUCL), overseas universities (e.g. Duke, Göttingen, Harvard, Twente) and companies and NGOs.\\nFunded industrial collaborations in the REF period include those with the BBC, Roessingh R&D\\nBV, OPTOS plc UK, NIDEK Technologies Srl (Italy/Japan), Hellenic Systems Ltd., and Tulip Ltd.\\nExemplars of effective research collaborations and networks not detailed elsewhere in this\\ndocument include the following:\\nARG-tech’s network includes Contact Engine (Reed appointed to Scientific Advisory Board),\\nOmbudsman Services, Juralio Ltd. (Reed served as interim CTO), IBM, and the UN. Pease has\\nlong-term connections and collaborations with the Universities of Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt, Queen\\nMary London, Saarbrücken, Genoa, Cambridge and Oxford, and with Dundee colleagues in\\nMedicine (Conway) and Art & Design (Moncur). Further ARG-tech collaborations include the\\nUniversities of Amsterdam, Utrecht, Southampton, Cardiff, Liverpool, Rutgers, CMU, and MIT.\\nCTM, through the European H2020 SERUMS (Securing Medical Data in Smart Patient-Centric\\nHealthcare System) project (Janjic), collaborates with University of St Andrews, Universite\\nCatholique de Louvian (Belgium), University of Cyprus, IBM, Accenture, Sopra-Steria (UK),\\nSoftware Competence Center Hagenberg (Austria) and two large hospital centres, Zuyderland\\nMedisch Centrum (Netherlands) and Fundacio Clinic per a la Recerca Biomedica (Spain). This\\nconsortium aims to put patients at the centre of future healthcare provision, enhancing personal\\ncare and quality of treatment, while ensuring trust in security and privacy of confidential data.\\nCVIP involvement with the Academic Health Science Partnership, established between UoD and\\nNHS Tayside in 2014 to promote translation of University healthcare technologies, has enhanced\\ncollaboration with NHS clinicians; McKenna and Trucco have funded collaboration with\\ndermatology on deep learning for skin lesion diagnosis; in HDR-UK (with UoD Medicine) Trucco\\nleads the Advanced machine learning for image analysis theme with University of Edinburgh\\nfocusing on MRI and clinical risk and outcome associations. The VAMPIRE retinal image analysis\\nprogramme (led by Trucco in long-term partnership with McGillivray at University of Edinburgh)\\nhas built an extensive network of interdisciplinary collaborators and clinical centres nationally\\n(Queen’s University, Belfast Ophthalmic Reading Centre and Centre for Public Health; Ulster\\nUniversity; UCL/Moorfields Eye Hospital) and internationally (Duke University; Tufts School of\\nMedicine; Harvard Medical School; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Grenoble; Universidad del\\nValle, Colombia; Dr Mohan’s Diabetes Speciality Hospitals; Madras Diabetes Research Centre)\\nwho apply VAMPIRE software and contribute directly or indirectly to the image analysis research.\\nHCC collaborates in W3C where Crabb leads on developing Mixed Reality Web Guidelines for\\nWCAG3.0. Crabb is a member of the BBC UX Research Partnership, established between BBC\\nR&D, UoD, UCL, and the Universities of Bath, Newcastle, Nottingham, and Swansea. Work on\\n                                                                                                Page 12\\n\\n\\nimplementation of accessible services has resulted in changes within the iPlayer platform, creating\\ninternational digital impact, as well as in joint publications and BBC White Papers.\\nExternal collaborations are fostered by encouraging incoming visitors as seminar speakers, visiting\\nscholars and distinguished visitors funded through external programmes such as SICSA and by\\ninternal strategic funding. SICSA sponsored the UoD-organised and hosted SICSA Medical Image\\nAnalysis Workshop in 2015 (McKenna, Trucco, Zhang) to build a network of researchers in\\nmedical image analysis, further bolstered through the SINAPSE Scottish Imaging network (Image\\nAnalysis Deputy Lead: Zhang), and helping to raise CVIP’s profile nationally and strengthen\\ncollaboration, particularly with the University of Edinburgh.\\nThe Unit has had a continuous flow of international research visitors including exchanges based on\\nexchange/travel grants or project grants. It hosted three Distinguished Visiting Fellows\\n(competitively awarded through SICSA): Moens (KU Leuven), Carpendale (University of Calgary)\\nand Johann (Appalachian State University). The Unit’s seminar series funds visitors largely from\\nthe UK and Western Europe for short stays, and occasionally longer visits from further afield. ARG-\\ntech alone hosted 34 research visitors over the period, nearly all international. Outgoing\\ninternational visiting positions included Trucco’s adjunct professorship at the Chinese Academy of\\nSciences, Ningbo (2016-19) and Reed’s appointments as Visiting Professor, Polish Academy of\\nSciences (Dec 2016-Dec 2017) and Senior Research Fellow, University of Konstanz, DFG Cluster\\nof Excellence (Jan-Jun 2020).\\n4.2 Relationships with Research Users, Beneficiaries and Audiences to Develop Impact\\nEnd users are involved in most of the Unit’s research from grant application through to impact.\\nProjects typically have advisory groups, ensuring relevance to users and beneficiaries, and more\\nlasting impact, e.g. the ACE-LP (EPSRC) advisory group drawn from people who use AAC,\\nclinicians, charities representing disabled people, and industrial experts. Its central hypothesis was\\nthat communication rate and experience of people who use Voice Output Communication Aids can\\nbe improved by leveraging automatically perceived contextual data to inform a probabilistic\\nlanguage module. In addition to engaging in research, industry research partners actively took part\\nin HCC public engagement with national museums, e.g. More than just computer speech (National\\nMuseums Scotland, https://vimeo.com/358837456) and Technology Taster Day (V&A Dundee,\\nhttps://vimeo.com/359049317).\\nThe Unit has a Public Engagement Officer, and the School Deputy Director for Public Engagement\\nis from the Unit (Black). All clusters are involved in public engagement. In 2015, Computing, in\\ncollaboration with Leisure & Culture Dundee and Life Sciences, created a public engagement\\nvenue: Outer Space|Inner Space (https://aac.dundee.ac.uk/osis/) at the iconic Mills Observatory.\\nComputing events hosted there include Ways of Vision (Flatla) and Alien Surfaces (Martin). Outer\\nSpace|Inner Space created the brands Science Saturdays and Wednesday Wonders, offering\\nactivities for an established, interested audience of all ages. This will continue to allow the Unit to\\nshare its work without the need to organise suitable accessible venues. Staff gave outreach talks,\\ne.g., at Edinburgh International Science Festival (Pease 2017); Café Science on Computational\\nCreativity (Pease 2016) and Voices from Care Homes (McIntyre, Postdoc, 2015); TedX Dundee\\n(Trucco 2015); and Dundee Women’s Festival (Waller 2020).\\nHCC maintains the User Centre, a collaborative network drawn from “hard to reach” population\\ngroups, meeting weekly in the QMB, run by users, and with Crabb as academic contact. It includes\\na pool of older computer users from which researchers can recruit participants for user studies; the\\nStraight-Talking Group, an active group of adults with complex physical disabilities who use AAC\\n                                                                                                Page 13\\n\\n\\nsystems; and the Tap and Talk Aphasia Group which works with former NHS stroke patients\\ninvestigating mainstream iPad apps from an accessibility perspective. User pools are augmented\\nby users accessed through clinical partners. They have been involved in multiple projects in UoD\\nand elsewhere (e.g. Napier, Robert Gordon, and Newcastle Universities).\\nUoD recognises excellence in public engagement through its Stephen Fry awards; commendations\\nfor work that excelled at engaging audiences with research were awarded to ARG-tech (Reed et\\nal., 2018, 2019) for “argumentation technology and the BBC”, for Outer Space|Inner Space (2017),\\nand for engaged researcher of the year (Black, HCC 2019). As an example of media coverage, the\\nACE-LP EPSRC project featured on BBC Click with a live computer vision and AAC demo and\\ninterview in front of a V&A audience (2020).\\nStaff contribute to policy debate and provide commentary on industry research. For example, Reed\\nwas invited speaker at the Holyrood Communications\\' Effective Digital Communication event\\n(2018), contributed to Scientific Briefing on “Fake News” at the Parliamentary & Scientific\\nCommittee, Palace of Westminster (2019), and to an All-Party Parliamentary Group on AI (2020).\\nMcKenna and Trucco have both participated in scoping events for Toshiba/Canon as invited\\nexperts (2015, 2019). Reed was invited as sole academic commentator at IBM\\'s Project Debater\\nlaunch (San Francisco, 2018).\\nSTAR-Dundee, a 2002 spin-out from the Unit, continues to work with UoD and won Design and\\nInnovation Business of the Year at the Courier Business Awards 2017. The Enterprise in Education\\naward was won by My Diabetes My Way, Scotland’s interactive website and mobile app for people\\nwith diabetes, impact arising from user-centred design and health informatics research supervised\\nby Waller in collaboration with the School of Medicine. It allows all 310k people with diabetes in\\nScotland to support self-management and access clinical records, is evidenced to improve clinical\\noutcomes and quality of life with cost savings of £230 for £33 invested (independently validated)\\nand was embedded in the Scottish Diabetes Improvement Plan and eHealth Strategy. It led to a\\n2017 spin-out (MyWay Digital Health) now employing 25 staff.\\nConsultancy is an important part of the Unit’s research activity as it provides a means to deliver\\nimpact and establish commercial relationships. Examples are Reed’s work as CTO for Juralio Ltd\\n(2013) and as a member of Contact Engine Ltd.’s AI Board (2018-) whose CEO is an Honorary\\nProfessor in ARG-tech.\\n4.3 Contributions to Sustainability of the Discipline\\nApart from all the research activities already mentioned that help to build and sustain the discipline,\\nstaff contribute by engaging with external PhD training. Nationally, for example, Computing hosted\\nthe SICSA PhD Conference 2017, the HCI Camp one-week summer school 2019 (Co-Chair:\\nCrabb), and the first Summer School on Argumentation (SSA-2014) with Pease contributing an\\ninvited talk. Internationally, Pease co-chaired the ICCC-2017 Doctoral Symposium and was an\\ninvited ICCC-2018 PhD panellist. Reed gave invited tutorials at the International Graduate School\\non Argument & Rhetoric (IGSAR-2014), and the Swiss Universities Doctoral Programme Language\\n& Cognition PhD Workshop on Linguistic & Corpus Perspectives on Argumentative Discourse\\n(Fribourg 2019), an invited lecture at the Argupolis doctoral programme (Lugano 2014) and taught\\na course (with Budzynska) at ESSLLI-2017 European Summer School.

      "[\"University of Nottingham\\n Unit of Assessment: 11 – Computer Science and Informatics\\n 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n 1.1. Context and Strategy\\n Computer Science at Nottingham continues to pursue and maximise the impact of its highly\\n successful strategy of grounding its research in real-world challenges and settings. Our strength\\n in advancing core computer science, combined with flexible structures that allow timely response\\n to new challenges and an ability to connect knowledge and methods both across computer\\n science and between the computational and other disciplines enables deep collaborations with\\n diverse research users. Our research naturally remains strongly user-focused, interdisciplinary\\n and impactful.\\n Following intense strategic expansion in the previous REF period, the School has worked to\\n maximise flexibility and effectiveness before again increasing both capability and capacity. Over\\n the current period our commitment to and success in delivering our research strategy -\\n supported by significant investments in both people and facilities - have been marked by:\\n     \\uf0b7   Extension of our core capability through the establishment of a new Cyber Security\\n         (CybSec) group (following recruitment of Furnell, He, and Muller) and new appointments\\n         in visualisation (Laramee) and robotics (Kucuckyilmaz, Turner). The existing Horizon\\n         Digital Economy Institute, Intelligent Modelling and Analysis Group, Computer Vision\\n         Laboratory, Functional Programming Laboratory, Mixed Reality Laboratory and\\n         Computational Optimisation and Learning Group have also been strengthened by new\\n         appointments.\\n     \\uf0b7   Restructuring of and relaxation of the boundaries between the School’s research groups\\n         to produce an increased number of more responsive smaller, often overlapping, units.\\n     \\uf0b7   Increased interdisciplinary activity through the establishment of the Smart Products\\n         Beacon of Excellence [REF5a-2.1b] within the School (led by Benford) and active\\n         involvement in the University’s Future Food (Pridmore, Pound) and Precision Imaging\\n         (Valstar, French, Pound, Chen) Beacons (all arising from a £22.5M investment by the\\n         University) and the Mental Health and Technology Theme of the £23.6M NIHR\\n         Biomedical Research Centre (Valstar, Garibaldi, Perez).\\n     \\uf0b7   Renewed funding for the Horizon Digital Economy Institute (£4.1M, Koleva, McAuley)\\n         and Centre for Doctoral Training (£5.8M, Benford) for an unprecedented 3rd iteration.\\n     \\uf0b7   Strengthened links with established industries (e.g. Unilever, Microlise, Syngenta,\\n         NATS(Services) Ltd, BBC) and successful establishment of the spin-out company\\n         BlueSkeye AI with £235K investment from Angels and the University (Valstar).\\n     \\uf0b7   Influence on Government policy through McAuley and Rodden’s work on the ‘Age-\\n         Appropriate Design Code’ introduced by the Information Commissioner's Office and\\n         Rodden’s appointment as Chief Scientific Advisor to the Department for Digital, Culture,\\n         Media and Sport (DCMS).\\n The School currently numbers 50 Category A academic staff (46.2 FTE, of which 21% are\\n female), 47 post-doctoral researchers and 76 PhD students with further support from the\\n experience of 24 technical, managerial and professional employees. Our funding portfolio has\\n matured, with average income increasing from £3.9M p.a. in 2014 to £4.7M p.a. from a broader\\n range of funding sources. The School is now in receipt of awards from six of the seven UK\\n Research Councils, Innovate UK, the Royal Society and EU. Our international standing has also\\n                                                                                              Page 1\\n\\n\\n led to direct funding by the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research (Altenkirch) and US Dept\\n of Energy (Pridmore).\\n The School has directly received £33M in research income. The rich interdisciplinary nature of\\n our research, however, means that School staff are often instrumental in obtaining funding for\\n projects spanning the University; the total value of these awards to UoN within the REF period is\\n £70.9M, a significant increase on the £52M reported in 2014.\\n As recognised in our REF 2014 strategic aims, our vision of Computer Science as “computing in\\n the world” requires the School to continually strengthen and extend its core research base,\\n reach out to new industrial and academic partners and broaden its international scope. In\\n addition, flexible structures are required which both maintain depth of research in key areas of\\n computer science while supporting intra- and inter-disciplinary collaboration. Throughout the\\n current REF period the School has successfully achieved these goals; and it will maintain this\\n approach.\\n 1.2. Flexible Structures\\n The School’s research structures are designed to allow those working in distinct areas of\\n computer science the autonomy needed to pursue the most promising lines of enquiry while\\n encouraging and supporting intra-disciplinary collaboration. Our strategy has been to i)\\n recognise areas of significant activity within the previous group structure and ii) soften\\n boundaries between groups to encourage greater collaboration. Our model is of a larger network\\n of more interconnected, often smaller units, with staff operating across that network to best\\n advance their research and address emerging opportunities.\\n In the REF period the School has recognised the Agents Laboratory as performing high-quality\\n research in a distinct area; Alechina and Logan were previously members of the Foundations of\\n Programming group, now Functional Programming lab. The Lab for Uncertainty in Data and\\n Decision Making (LUCID) has emerged from Intelligent Modelling and Analysis (IMA) and\\n Computational Optimisation and Learning (COL, previously Automatic Scheduling and Planning)\\n to sit between and foster collaboration between those continuing groups. Renewed funding for\\n the Horizon Digital Economy Institute has ensured its continued existence, while the creation in\\n 2020 of a Cyber Security group further extends core capabilities.\\n The School now recognises nine groups:\\n     \\uf0b7 Agents Laboratory\\n     \\uf0b7 Computational Optimisation and Learning (COL)\\n     \\uf0b7 Computer Vision Laboratory (CVL)\\n     \\uf0b7 Cyber Security (CybSec)\\n     \\uf0b7 Functional Programming (FP)\\n     \\uf0b7 Lab for Uncertainty in Data and Decision Making (LUCID)\\n     \\uf0b7 Intelligent Modelling and Analysis (IMA)\\n     \\uf0b7 Mixed Reality Laboratory (MRL)\\n     \\uf0b7 Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute (Horizon)\\n These are discipline-based and located in distinct areas of the Computer Science building,\\n allowing senior staff to support the development of early career researchers and students and\\n encouraging co-working between staff with shared research interests. Each group is primarily\\n responsible for the development and pursuit of its research agenda, operating in the context of\\n the University’s research initiatives and structures; this independence is facilitated by devolved\\n budgets over which the groups have full autonomy. While each staff member is assigned to one\\n group for administrative purposes, group membership is informal and flexible. Many colleagues\\n                                                                                                Page 2\\n\\n\\n identify with and contribute to multiple groups, providing transfer of ideas and knowledge across\\n the School and allowing us to respond effectively to emerging challenges and opportunities.\\n Cross-group strategy and processes are co-ordinated by the School’s Director of Research\\n (Pridmore) who convenes a quarterly Research Strategy Group (RSG). RSG is a broad forum\\n discussing both long-term strategy and operational matters and includes representatives of each\\n group and School Research Administration Team. The Director of Research serves on the\\n School Operations Team alongside the Head of School (Garibaldi), Director of Teaching (Landa\\n Silva) and Director of Operations (Palmer), ensuring effective communication between research\\n groups and School Management.\\n 1.3. Strengthening Core Research\\n Throughout the REF period the School’s core research has been driven and strengthened by the\\n creation, activities and achievements of its research groups.\\n Agents Laboratory (Logan, Alechina (until 2019)). Research in the Agents Lab spans the\\n specification, design and implementation of agent-based systems, including logics for agents,\\n agent programming and verification, and the application of agents in simulation and virtual\\n environments. The Lab is internationally leading in the verification of autonomous systems that\\n operate under resource constraints, and in the synthesis of provably correct multi-agent\\n programs. Since 2014 the group has produced 9 PhDs and published 23 papers in top-ranked\\n (Microsoft Academic) international AI conferences (IJCAI, AAAI, AAMAS, ECAI) and 7 papers in\\n leading journals (AIJ, TCS, JAIR, JCSS). With financial support from the School, Agents Lab\\n instigated the Intention Progression Competition, an international initiative to advance research\\n in agent decision making (the paper proposing the competition won Best Paper at AAMAS\\n 2017). The Lab has received funding for work on the verification of multi-agent systems and has\\n strong links with colleagues in the Faculty of Engineering, collaborating on manufacturing-\\n focussed grants with a total value of £7.2M.\\n Computational Optimisation and Learning (Atkin, De Maere, John (new, until 2020),\\n Karapetyan (new), Landa Silva, Neri (new), Ozcan, Parkes, Qu, Triguero(new)). COL (the\\n natural evolution of the previous ASAP group) is at the cutting edge of new methodologies and\\n techniques for optimisation and learning. COL’s research is driven by a strong multi-disciplinary\\n approach to tackling real-world optimisation and data science problems across various sectors\\n including transport, energy, food production, logistics, healthcare, manufacturing, aerospace,\\n communications, finance and built environment. Core research covers mathematical\\n optimisation, evolutionary algorithms, swarm optimisation, hyper-heuristics, learning classifiers,\\n big-data learning algorithms, feature selection, neural P systems and membrane computing.\\n Impact is realised through the group’s many successful collaborations with industry. During the\\n REF period, COL has produced 37 PhDs and published 142 papers in leading journals (IEEE\\n TEC, IEEE TFS, EJOR, COR and others). COL’s work has contributed two ICSs [REF3\\n Improving Operations at London Heathrow and Geneva Airports and Improving Homecare\\n Quality]. The high-impact, multi-disciplinary nature of COL’s work is evidenced by their success\\n in obtaining Innovate UK and EU funding; during this REF period the group has been awarded 6\\n KTPs, 2 R&D Collaborative projects and 1 EU Horizon 2020 project.\\n Computer Vision Laboratory (French, Pound, Pridmore, Torres Torres, Tzimiropoulos (new,\\n until 2019), Valstar). CVL performs basic and applied research in image manipulation, analysis\\n and computer vision. The group develops novel and efficient techniques for the extraction of\\n quantitative descriptions of viewed objects from a variety of images and image sequences, and\\n translates those techniques into high quality software tools addressing real world problems. This\\n REF period has seen CVL supervise 43 PhDs, publish 8 papers in the top 3 computer vision\\n                                                                                              Page 3\\n\\n\\n conference (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV – Microsoft Academic) and 6 in top 5 Computer Vision journals\\n (IEEE PAMI, IEEE IP, IJCV – Microsoft Academic). CVL’s application-focussed work is also\\n internationally recognised. The group has expertise in visual affective computing and face\\n analysis, conducting world-leading research on topics including apparent emotion recognition,\\n face tracking, and the automatic assessment of mental health based on expressive behaviour.\\n Valstar (internationally the second-highest cited person in the field of social signal processing) is\\n Deputy Director of the Biomedical Research Centre’s Mental Health & Technology theme, a 5-\\n year interdisciplinary research programme on objective mental health assessment. This led to\\n spin-out in 2019 of BlueSkeye AI. CVL is at the forefront of image-based plant phenotyping\\n research in the UK and Europe, evidenced by its key role in the ESFRI roadmap project\\n EMPHASIS, in which they are partnered by BBSRC and BEIS. Pridmore received £300K from\\n the US Dept of Energy (ARPA-e) to support work in this area and is Director of the UK’s national\\n plant phenotyping network, PhenomUK.\\n Cyber Security (Furnell (new), He (new), Muller (new), McAuley, Wagner, Pound, Twycross,\\n Radenkovic). CybSec was formed in 2020 following appointment of Prof Steven Furnell but\\n draws together members of pre-existing groups with an interest in security. CybSec is a centre\\n of interdisciplinary cyber security research and education, securing the digital environment\\n through combined advances in formal and human-centric cyber security research. The unpinning\\n aim of the group’s research is ensuring security that is effective for those who need it,\\n recognising who cybersecurity is actually for – namely the individuals, organisations and wider\\n society that want to use and trust the technology – and enabling protection that works in a\\n manner that they can relate to. CybSec’s core activities sit at the intersection of security\\n technology and those that use it. The group’s focus is upon delivering the theoretic security\\n properties in practice, removing technical obstacles and achieving effective and usable\\n approaches, alongside human-centric solutions that empower people to be the strongest link.\\n Functional Programming Lab (Altenkirch, Capretta, Hutton, Kraus (new), Nilsson). FP’s aim is\\n to develop simple but powerful techniques for writing and reasoning about programs, by\\n recognising and exploiting their underlying mathematical structure. Since 2014 FP received\\n £1.75M of external funding, graduated 15 PhDs, and developed fundamental new results in type\\n theory, category theory, functional programming, reactive programming and corecursive\\n structures. Altenkirch’s work on dependent types was internationally recognised by the award of\\n $700 from the US Air Force Office of Science and Technology. Kraus recently joined the group\\n as an associate professor, supported by a £550K Royal Society University Research\\n Fellowship. Members played a leading role in the international community, serving on the\\n editorial boards of the Journal of Functional Programming, Fundamenta Informaticae and ACM\\n ICPS, program chair of the TLCA, MPC and FARM conferences, chair of the Haskell committee,\\n member of the EU-TYPES cost action and co-founders of the Midlands Graduate School.\\n Intelligent Modelling and Analysis (Chen (new), Garibaldi, Greensmith, Qiu, Siebers, Turner\\n (new), Twycross, Wagner, Zhou(new)). IMA’s work on complex data analysis, knowledge\\n representation, machine learning, decision support algorithms and modelling of human decision\\n making have impacted biomedical informatics, security, energy management and digital\\n economy. The group played a leading role in developing computational algorithms for the\\n Nottingham Molecular Pathology Node, one of the six national MRC/EPSRC pathology nodes\\n launched in 2014 which aimed to establish multidisciplinary centres of innovative molecular\\n diagnostic test discovery and development bringing together the research base,\\n pathology/genetic NHS services and industry. IMA also contributes decision support algorithms,\\n medical modelling and data analysis to the Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre. IMA's\\n multidisciplinary research has been instrumental in creating novel models of synthetic biology\\n within the University's Synthetic Biology Research, a £14.M centre funded by BBSRC/EPSRC in\\n 2014. IMA has strong links to the Advanced Data Analysis Centre (now Digital Research\\n                                                                                                Page 4\\n\\n\\n Service), which has been established as a permanent unit within UoN during the REF period and\\n links IMA research outputs to real-world applications.\\n Laboratory for Uncertainty in Data and Decision Making (Wagner, Garibaldi, Figueredo,\\n John (new, until 2020)). Alongside colleagues from COL, members of IMA established LUCID in\\n 2016 to encourage agile collaboration between staff and students working on uncertainty in data\\n and decision making. Building on a rapidly growing network of national and international\\n collaborators, including at ANU (Australia), CMU (USA), UNavarra (Spain), and Uni.lu\\n (Luxembourg), LUCID has addressed research challenges around uncertainty-in-data in areas\\n from data-driven environmental management and smart (consumer-led) manufacturing to cyber\\n security. It has attracted ~£1.7M direct funding and ~£24M as stakeholder in hub and centre\\n grants from a diverse set of research funders including EPSRC, NERC, Unilever, JP Morgan,\\n DSTL and the NCSC. Most recently, LUCID launched DECSYS, a novel survey platform for\\n sourcing uncertain information directly from people, with direct support from the NCSC.\\n DECSYS has already been used in cyber security and marketing research and the underpinning\\n science is being explored for a new generation of consumer engagement with leading\\n manufacturers including Unilever, Nestlé and PepsiCo.\\n Mixed Reality Laboratory (Benford, Chamberlain, Crabtree, Fischer, Flintham, Greenhalgh,\\n Koleva, Kucuckyilmaz (new), Laramee (new), Milic-Frayling (new), Marshall, Reeves, Rodden,\\n Tennent, Wilson). The lab creates and studies interactive technologies and experiences that\\n interleave the digital and the physical to enhance everyday life. Research themes have included\\n human interaction with agent collectives; establishing trust in personal data; and brain and body\\n control of interactive systems. Cultural and creative applications have remained a major focus,\\n with collaborations with artists producing performances that have been directly experienced by\\n 40000 people in 40 venues across seven countries [REF3 ICS: Innovating Cultural Products].\\n Work on Internet of Things has led to burgeoning research on smart products including a\\n research framework agreement with Unilever, while digital technology and mental health is\\n emerging as a key research area, in collaboration with the University’s Institute of Mental Health.\\n Notable achievements during this period include: 3 Best Papers, a Best Arts Paper and 6\\n Honorable Mentions at the CHI conference; 9 papers in ACM Transactions on CHI; an EPSRC\\n Platform Grant; two EPSRC Programme Grants; two EPSRC Fellowships; a Leverhulme\\n Fellowship; a Nottingham NRF Fellowship; and Rodden being elected an ACM Fellow, seconded\\n to be deputy CEO of EPSRC, and Chief Scientific Advisor to DCMS. The lab celebrated its 20th\\n anniversary in 2019 by staging a major retrospective exhibition at the CHI conference and\\n hosting the first Halfway to the Future symposium.\\n Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute (Koleva, McAuley, Benford, Crabtree, Fischer,\\n Flintham, Perez, Radenkovic, Reeves, Rodden, Valstar, Wagner). The UKRI funded Horizon\\n Digital Economy Research Institute centred at the University of Nottingham brings together an\\n interdisciplinary team with expertise from a wide variety of backgrounds including computer\\n science, engineering, mathematics, psychology, sociology, business, social science and the\\n arts. Horizon focusses on the collection and understanding of personal data to address the user-\\n centred design and development of data-driven products, which are more personalised, adaptive\\n and trusted and as a result, deliver greater value to consumers, producers and society. Horizon\\n was established in 2009 and its EPSRC funding renewed in 2015 and 2020, providing £20.7M in\\n total. It is an active member of the national network of Digital Economy Centres. Horizon has\\n strong links with external organisations including those working in the areas of healthcare, art,\\n communications, finance and creative media. Horizon’s body of research and the impact this is\\n having on how users and policy makers engage with technology is the subject of an impact case\\n study [REF3 ICS: Protecting the Rights of Young People].\\n                                                                                              Page 5\\n\\n\\n 1.4. Working across Disciplines\\n The University of Nottingham’s commitment to maximising the transformative value of research\\n led to a £22.5M investment in 6 Transdisciplinary Beacons of Excellence [REF5a-2.1b] during\\n the REF period. Each Beacon addresses a global challenge and is directed at UN Sustainable\\n Development Goals. Computer Science is closely involved with 3 Beacons: Smart Products\\n (intelligent products, production and consumer experiences), Future Food (feeding the world in\\n the context of climate change) and Precision Imaging (precision medicine).\\n Smart Products (centred on the School and led by Benford) articulates a new research vision\\n around the future of products. This brings together views from manufacturing and consumption\\n into a whole-life perspective and combines technologies concerned with physical artefacts from\\n Engineering with those focused on digital media from Computer Science and Arts and\\n Humanities. Smart Products is supported by two new appointments (Kucuckyilmaz, Turner) in\\n Computer Science, and investment of £632K (£212K by EPSRC and £420K by the University) in\\n a new Cobot Maker Space, a facility dedicated to human-robot interaction and collaboration\\n where researchers, industry partners (especially SMEs) and the public can engage with\\n Interactive Robotics and AI.\\n Smart Products has awards totalling £21M, including £17.9M directly linked to the Beacon (30\\n awards). A significant proportion are strategic awards to multidisciplinary groups of researchers\\n at UoN, working alongside collaborators at other Universities. This includes the EPSRC-funded\\n Horizon CDT (£5.8M) and Horizon Digital Economy Research Centre (£4.1M) - both proposals\\n had the Smart Products vision at their core – and the recently announced Trustworthy\\n Autonomous Systems Hub (£2.2M).\\n Computer Science involvement in Future Food centres on plant phenotyping technologies,\\n specifically the computer vision techniques underpinning image-based phenotyping. Pridmore\\n serves on the Leadership Team of the Beacon, and Pound transitioned to an Assistant\\n Professorship in Computer Science in 2020 following successful completion of his Nottingham\\n Research Fellowship, associated with Future Food. Beacon investment has provided some £2M\\n in cross-university support for phenotyping equipment and development resources, including\\n state of the art laser ablation tomography, fluorescence and structured light imaging equipment\\n and a dedicated Maker Space supporting development of hardware solutions. Within the REF\\n period CVL has won 10 research awards targeting computer vision problems in plant\\n phenotyping with a total value of £2.2M. Nottingham now leads both the UK national plant\\n phenotyping network and UK involvement in the ESFRI EMPHASIS project, highlighted in\\n BBSRC’s 2019 Delivery Plan.\\n School staff contribute to and benefit from interactions with the University’s world-leading MRI\\n and precision medicine community. Valstar’s work on computer vision and healthcare, and\\n French, Pound and Chen’s on bioimage analysis contribute to the Precision Imaging Beacon.\\n Valstar, Perez Vallejos’ and Garibaldi’s involvement in the University’s Biomedical Research\\n Centre (BRC) has contributed to Nottingham becoming a recognised centre of excellence for\\n objective assessment of mental health conditions and led to collaboration with the University of\\n Auckland on digital mental health interventions (Greenhalgh).\\n In addition to these established and recognised research units, interdisciplinary projects are\\n common within the School including:\\n     \\uf0b7 Greensmith’s (IMA) completion of an EPSRC-funded discipline hopping grant working\\n          with immunologists in Nottingham’s School of Medicine.\\n                                                                                               Page 6\\n\\n\\n     \\uf0b7   Ozcan’s partnership in two Marie Curie ITN awards led by Nottingham’s Faculty of\\n         Engineering and co-investigator role in an EPSRC CDT in Sustainable Chemistry led by\\n         Nottingham’s School of Chemistry.\\n     \\uf0b7   Twycross’ involvement in the Nottingham Synthetic Biology Research Centre and work\\n         with School of Life Sciences.\\n     \\uf0b7   MRL’s multiple collaborations with the Dept. of Music (including Greenhalgh’s ‘Losing her\\n         voice’ opera project) and portfolio of four AHRC grants totalling over £1M.\\n 1.5. Impact and Knowledge Exchange\\n Impact and knowledge exchange is guided by the University’s Knowledge Exchange Strategic\\n Delivery Plan, Research Vision and Impact Strategy, with local support and processes in place\\n at school level.\\n The School takes a proactive approach to impact, with investigator-led impact reviews of each\\n grant being prompted by administrative staff at regular intervals. Investigators have access to a\\n Faculty-funded Impact Officer who works with academics and researchers to develop, document\\n and evidence impact, and a senior academic has time dedicated to supporting impact. Horizon\\n employs a dedicated Knowledge Exchange and Impact Officer who works across the portfolio of\\n Horizon projects to identify, accelerate and publicise impacts generated by the institute and a\\n Transformation Manager with expert knowledge of the funding environment and who facilitates\\n industrial links. These colleagues work with academic staff to identify opportunities for impact\\n acceleration and translation through engagement with bodies such as Nottingham’s Institute for\\n Policy and Engagement, the IP Commercialisation Team and by supporting applications to\\n Impact Acceleration Account (IAA) funding. In the REF period the School has won 13 EPSRC\\n IAAs, one BBSRC IAA and an MRC Confidence in Concept with a total value of £184K.\\n In addition to the four impact case studies in REF3 - Improving Operations at London Heathrow\\n and Geneva Airports Through Modelling and Optimisation (Atkin), Improving Homecare\\n Quality in the UK Through Optimised Workforce Planning (Landa Silva), Innovating Cultural\\n Products for the Creative Industries (Benford), Protecting the Rights of Young People Within the\\n Digital Space (McAuley, Perez) - impact achieved in the current period includes:\\n     \\uf0b7 integration of the School’s research into government policy through Rodden’s role as\\n         Chief Scientific Advisor to DCMS.\\n     \\uf0b7 contribution of research expertise to UK government policy supporting the UK’s digital\\n         competition market (McAuley).\\n     \\uf0b7 adoption by the Western Australian Government of the uncertain data-driven\\n         environmental management and policy design methodology developed in collaboration\\n         with LUCID and highlighted in the 20-year management plan for the Toolibin wetland, a\\n         Ramsar-certified wetland of international importance.\\n     \\uf0b7 successful spin-out of BlueSkeye AI with £235K venture capital (Valstar).

Broadening International Scope\\n REF2014 outlined plans for further global outreach. That this is being achieved is evidenced by:\\n     \\uf0b7 48/116 (41.3%) of our returned outputs including international co-authors.\\n     \\uf0b7 MRL’s two AHRC-funded UK-China creative industry grants focussed on connected\\n         museums.\\n     \\uf0b7 Qiu’s collaboration on FOTOR (China).\\n     \\uf0b7 Pridmore and French’s £320K BBSRC GCRF project in collaboration with CIAT,\\n         Colombia.\\n     \\uf0b7 Wagner’s work on environmental management tools with the Dept. of Parks and Wildlife\\n         and University of Western Australia.\\n School researchers also collaborate on large scale international research projects including EU\\n projects (worth £3.65M or 9.5% of award income) and projects funded by the US Government\\n through ARPA-e (Pridmore) and the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research (Altenkirch). Our\\n growing presence at and strengthened research links with the University’s China and Malaysia\\n campuses are evidenced by collaborations including Qu’s work on container transportation\\n scheduling at Ningbo port, the world’s 4th largest container port.\\n 1.7. Open Research\\n We strongly promote a culture of open research [REF5a-2.3], as the delivery of our vision of\\n “computing in the world” turns on users being able to use solutions developed at Nottingham and\\n feed back to research teams. Support staff target reminders about open access and depositing\\n outputs into the institutional repository to academics with new publications and assist in the\\n process. The School hosts sessions on open access publication at academic meetings and\\n away days, provided by specialists from within the University.\\n We are proactive in the development of open research infrastructures. Wagner has co-\\n developed multiple open-source software frameworks making research outputs accessible to\\n peer researchers within and beyond computer science including Juzzy and JuzzyOnline, each\\n with some 1000 users. In the last 5 years JuzzyOnline was accessed by users from more than\\n 50 and Juzzy by users from over 125 countries. IMA has released a Fuzzy-R toolkit. Valstar has\\n created and released the AVEC, FERA, SEMAINE, and Noxi datasets, which together have\\n been cited 1575 times during the REF period. Pound and French have developed and released\\n a variety of annotated image data sets designed to support development of machine learning\\n solutions to agricultural challenges through the Annotated Crop Image Database (ACID). ACID\\n has recently been adopted as a national resource by PhenomUK. Links to the open access\\n software and data resources produced by the School are maintained on the School website.\\n 1.8. Research Integrity\\n The School follows the UoN Code of Research Conduct and Research Ethics [REF5a-2.4],\\n ensuring a sustainable culture of research integrity and good practice. The School Research\\n Ethics Committee (seven academics, four researchers, one research student, one non-school\\n representative, one lay member) approves all taught and research projects involving human\\n                                                                                               Page 8\\n\\n\\n participants or personal data in advance (69 projects in 2019/20). All new research and teaching\\n staff and research students attend compulsory research ethics training; research students also\\n complete an online introduction to research integrity. All taught project students receive a lecture\\n on research ethics. The Ethics Committee maintains a web page with details of processes and\\n links to supporting resources, including relevant school and university policies and best practice.\\n The Research Ethics Officers (Greenhalgh, Crabtree) Chair the committee, contribute to\\n University discussion of research ethics and integrity and ensure that the School remains up to\\n date with University requirements and best practice, updating School processes and reporting to\\n the School at least annually.\\n The School’s research also contributes to wider ethical thinking in Computer Science through\\n Horizon’s contribution to methods for Responsible Research Innovation (RRI), led by Perez in\\n partnership with RRI researchers at Oxford and De Montfort, and to industry through the release\\n of our Moral-IT deck of ideation cards and through shaping policies such as Online Harms at\\n DCMS.\\n 1.9. Future Plans\\n In the next period the School’s strength in multidisciplinary research will be expanded through\\n investment in capacity around Cyber-physical AI (CYPHAI) and the related areas of Embodied\\n Intelligence and AI in Manufacturing. Following the formation of the Cyber Security Research\\n Group and building on the recent investments in Smart Products, the School will create three\\n further groupings in this broad area:\\n      1. Cyber-Medical Research [1-2 new staff]: A Professor in Cyber-Medical Systems will be\\n          recruited to integrate the various strands of medical research underway in the School\\n          building on our involvement in the NIHR-funded £24M Nottingham Biomedical Research\\n          Centre.\\n      2. Cybernetics (AI Robotics) Research [5 new staff]: A Professor in Cybernetics / AI will\\n          be recruited to lead a new research group in intelligent robotics, with potential for multi-\\n          disciplinary interactions with the Faculty of Engineering, and leading the further\\n          development of our newly created Cobot Maker Space.\\n      3. Embodied Intelligence Research [5 new staff]: A Professor in Embodied Intelligence\\n          will be recruited to lead a new research group in Human-AI Hardware/Software\\n          Interaction deepening our involvement with the new UKRI programme in Trustworthy\\n          Autonomous Systems, where we are one of the three partners in the £12M national hub\\n          and a partner in the Governance node.\\n A total of 12 new academic staff will be recruited across these areas, taking into account the\\n need to strengthen complementarity with existing research groups within the School. These new\\n initiatives will be supported by construction of a new £260K CYPHAI Laboratory in the School of\\n Computer Science and further investment in the Smart Products Cobot Maker Space. The\\n School will also establish a Doctoral Training Programme in Artificial Intelligence, continuing our\\n policy of supporting intra- and interdisciplinary research in key areas of computer science and\\n further strengthening links with industrial and academic partners.\\n Though the challenges addressed naturally change over time, our successful strategy of\\n engaging world-leading computer science research with real-world problems has remained in\\n place since the previous REF and is expected to underpin the School’s activities for the\\n foreseeable future.\\n                                                                                                 Page 9\\n\\n\\n 2. People\\n 2.1. Staffing Strategy and Staff Development\\n The School of Computer Science aims to attract, develop and retain high performing talent while\\n fostering a culture focused on diversity, inclusivity, wellbeing and positive engagement across all\\n our groupings and activities.\\n At the REF2021 census date: 17% (1.8F, 11.2M) of Category A staff were employed at\\n Professorial level,13% (2F, 9.2M) at Associate Professor/Principal Research Fellow level, 27%\\n (6F,16M) at Lecturer/Senior Research Fellow level and the remaining 43% (9.5F, 24M) as\\n Research Fellows. In our UoA, we have 3% (2M) (FTE) early career, 65% (7.8F, 42.4M) of staff\\n are employed on permanent, contracts and 35% (9.5F, 18M) on fixed term contracts.\\n 2.1.1. Recruitment\\n 16 external appointments have been made to strengthen and extend our core research base\\n and support increased intra- and inter-disciplinary collaboration, particularly around Cyber\\n Security and the Smart Products Beacon. Four Professors (Furnell, Gaertner (until 2019), John,\\n Milic-Frayling), three Associate Professors (Kraus, Laramee, Neri) and nine Assistant Professors\\n (Chen, He, Karapetyan, Kucukyilmaz, Muller, Triguero, Turner, Tzimiropoulos, Zhou) have been\\n appointed in the period. 16 staff left, and Professor John passed away in 2020.\\n A further four Transitional Assistant Professors were appointed through the Horizon Digital\\n Economy Research Institute. All have now moved to permanent Assistant Professorships at the\\n University, two (Reeves, Torres Torres) in Computer Science, one (Perez) in Mathematical\\n Sciences and one (Pinchin) in Engineering. Twycross (2016), Schnadelbach (2018) and Pound\\n (2020) transitioned to Assistant Professorships in Computer Science on completion of\\n Nottingham Research Fellowships [REF5a-3.2]. Marshall and Tennent were promoted from\\n Senior Research Fellow to Assistant Professor.\\n Progression of post-doctoral staff has been supported by appointments to partial (0.2 FTE)\\n Assistant Professor positions alongside their research posts. Of the four during the REF period,\\n De Maere is now full time Assistant Professor in the School, Coughlan is Lecturer at the Open\\n University, Soria is Senior Lecturer at the University of Westminster and Rennick-Egglestone is\\n Senior Research Fellow at Nottingham’s Institute for Mental Health.\\n Our recruitment processes take input from the whole School community; interview panels\\n (trained in Interview Skills for Chair and Panel Members) comprise diverse academics working\\n across the School. All academic and research staff and PhD students are invited to and\\n encouraged to attend presentations by candidates and given opportunities to feed their opinions\\n into the process. We strictly follow UoN EDI strategies throughout recruitment to ensure\\n candidates are treated solely on the basis of their abilities and potential.\\n We take a flexible approach to working patterns; four staff have taken a reduction in FTE at the\\n University, on a permanent or temporary basis, to take on roles at Samsung (Tzimiropoulos),\\n Yahoo (Zhou), Standard Chartered (Nilsson) and Ernst & Young (Koene). These arrangements\\n allow staff to pursue opportunities with high-profile companies and advance the School’s\\n strategy of reaching out to new industrial partners. UoN is actively exploring how policies for\\n flexible working can being used as effectively as possible to support all staff.\\n                                                                                              Page 10\\n\\n\\n 2.1.2. Staff Development\\n Personal development and research career progression of all staff are supported and reviewed\\n at least annually through UoN’s Appraisal Development Conversation (ADC) process [REF5a-\\n 3.1]. This is overseen by the Head of School and Director of Staff Development (Hutton). Early\\n career academic staff benefit from reduced teaching and administrative loads and the support of\\n a senior academic mentor. They are prioritised in the PhD studentship allocation process and\\n provided with a seed budget to help them establish their research. Research staff are supported\\n in achieving their potential through a system of mentoring including their immediate principal\\n investigator, research group leader and the Director of Staff Development.\\n In addition to peer mentoring and support schemes operating both formally and informally in the\\n School, staff are supported by a comprehensive programme of professional development\\n training. PhD supervision and review skills training is provided by the PGR Director (Qu),\\n working with the Researcher Academy [REF5a-3.3]; research ethics training is provided by the\\n Research Ethics Officers. The University provides numerous research-focussed training courses\\n including annual sessions on research integrity. Staff in leadership roles have access to training\\n and resources through the Nottingham Leadership and Management Academy, which provides\\n a comprehensive programme of activities for staff (Pridmore 2015, Gaertner 2016) across\\n themes including leading people, financial management, networking and managing change\\n [REF5A-3.5].\\n Support for the development of research is comprehensive:\\n      \\uf0b7 Since 2014 our Study Leave programme provided over 8000 hours of paid study leave to\\n         academic staff to support writing of research proposals and papers and the development\\n         of international collaboration.\\n      \\uf0b7 Financial support for the development, acceleration and dissemination of research is\\n         provided through the devolved budgets allocated to each research group. These are\\n         based on the number of academic staff and PhD students plus a generous percentage of\\n         research income. Groups have full autonomy over this budget.\\n      \\uf0b7 Additional funding for conference attendance is made available by the Faculty of\\n         Science. Allocation is managed by the School to ensure those who most need the\\n         funding are able to access it, taking into account individual circumstances, caring\\n         responsibilities, etc.\\n      \\uf0b7 The School operates a Grant Academy to which staff can submit, at any time, draft\\n         research proposals for review by and discussion with senior colleagues.\\n      \\uf0b7 The Director of Staff Development is available to support staff at all stages of the\\n         proposal development process including assisting with responding to reviewer comments\\n         and adapting unsuccessful ideas for further submission.\\n      \\uf0b7 In preparation for REF2021 the Faculty made funding available to support enhancement\\n         of impact of both potential impact case studies and research outputs. The application\\n         mechanism included an EDI process to ensure gender balance and encourage a positive\\n         action balance for staff with protected characteristics.\\n Exceptional performance and contribution in the School are recognised through nomination by\\n colleagues to the Nottingham Reward Scheme, which provides a framework of financial rewards\\n recognising contributions spanning the full range of activities. The School has facilitated eight\\n awards in the REF period (two to academic, three to research and three to administrative and\\n professional staff).\\n Through ADC we have facilitated seven promotions to Professor (Altenkirch, Crabtree, Koleva,\\n Landa Silva, Qiu, Valstar, Wagner), seven promotions to Associate Professor (Atkin, Fischer,\\n French, Ozcan, Triguero, Tzimiropoulos, Wilson). In line with principles of responsible metrics, h-\\n                                                                                              Page 11\\n\\n\\n index and other publication metrics are no longer an assessment criterion for promotion. Part-\\n time contracts and periods of absence (e.g. maternity leave) are taken into account and the\\n process concentrates on quality of delivery over quantity. Staff are supported through the\\n promotions process by a School promotions group and assigned mentor. Unsuccessful\\n applicants are given constructive feedback, supporting future applications.\\n 2.2. Research Students\\n  Our PGR community comprises 49.4% Home, 7.9% EU, 42.7% International, 96.6% full-time,\\n  3.4% part-time, 27.7% female, and 13.8% declared a disability. Over the REF period we have\\n  graduated 157.49 FTE (46.49 F/101 M) PhDs with an average 4-year submission rate of 51%.\\n  34.4% of our REF outputs include a PhD student author and 10.4% of our PhD students have at\\n  least one author credit.\\n  PhD funding is received from UKRI, industry, charities and the Horizon CDT, which was renewed\\n  for a £5.8M third iteration in the REF period, bringing its total funding to £14.9M. We provide 6-10\\n  fully-funded PhD studentships each year from our Scholarship budget (£194K in 2020/21). A\\n  rigorous application and assessment process involves a diverse panel of academic staff who\\n  adhere to UoN EDI strategy to ensure the highest quality students receive priority on funding. The\\n  CDT programme admits one intake of students per year to promote the building of collegiate\\n  cohorts, providing peer support networks for students. The current CDT award will see five cohorts\\n  admitted, totalling 65 students and building on the 109 students supported through the first two\\n  funding rounds.\\n  2.2.1.Training\\n  PGR students undertake a structured induction programme (covering research methods, ethics,\\n  communication and dissemination, supervision practice and University processes) and have\\n  access to academic, career and personal development courses run by the Professional\\n  Development Unit and the Researcher Academy [REF5a-3.3]. Students funded by the Horizon\\n  CDT complete a four-year programme involving an initial training year in the Centre followed by\\n  a three year PhD programme embedded in an academic department, many being based in\\n  Computer Science. These initial processes are supported by provision of online PGR study\\n  materials. PhD students have opportunities to develop teaching/dissemination skills alongside\\n  their research with teaching lab demonstration work, guest lecturing opportunities and voluntary\\n  placements to teach at Nottingham’s overseas campuses in China and Malaysia, all overseen by\\n  an academic mentor.\\n  The School takes an active role in the development of research students per se by its involvement\\n  in development programmes. Nottingham is a founder member of the Midlands Graduate School\\n  in the Foundations of Computer Science (MGS) and hosted the weeklong programme of courses\\n  twice during the REF period. Nottingham is also a founder member of the National Taught Course\\n  Centre in Operational Research (NATCOR) and has hosted training for PhD students seven times\\n  during the REF period. Both MGS and NATCOR have become self-sufficient since 2014.\\n  2.2.2. Support\\n  PGR progress, experience and well-being are overseen by the PGR Director and Director of\\n  Research with support from the Researcher Academy.\\n  During the REF period, the School has enhanced its internal review processes to ensure that\\n  students are best prepared to progress between each stage of their PhD and into their viva. Each\\n  student undergoes a rigorous end of year review, in addition to their regular, recorded, supervisor\\n                                                                                               Page 12\\n\\n\\n  meetings, which confirms their progress and implements actions to address areas of concern. At\\n  the end of their third year, each student meets with the Director of Research and PGR Director to\\n  discuss the writing, submission and examination process and ensure they understand what is\\n  expected of them. A Student Welfare Officer is based in the School to provide advice, guidance\\n  and support to students experiencing difficulties of any nature, and we have trained seven mental\\n  health First-Aiders. Student Services staff are embedded in the School’s administration office to\\n  provide further advice and support.\\n The School holds a PGR Learning Community Forum (LCF) meeting three times per year. This\\n is chaired by the PGR Director and provides a forum for representative PGR students to discuss\\n both academic and non-academic issues. In recent meetings, the LCF has discussed the\\n implementation of further support structures for students in their thesis pending periods, an\\n internal communications tool for PhD students to help build the community and representation of\\n PGR students at Faculty level.\\n Our PhD graduates have been highly successful in their onward careers in this period, securing\\n academic research positions (e.g. Wang and Song now PDRAs at Cambridge), launching start-\\n up companies (e.g. Userfy, Makers of Imaginary Worlds and callforparticpants.com (acquired by\\n Jisc Beta service)), and securing competitive positions in industry (e.g. Amazon, Samsung AI,\\n Facebook, Microsoft, Airbus, Jaguar Land Rover).\\n 2.3. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion\\n EDI underpins all activities, following UoN’s EDI Strategy and supported by the School’s EDI\\n Committee, which includes academic, technical, research and administrative staff together with\\n UG and PGR students. The School has held an Athena Swan Bronze award since 2013,\\n renewed in 2017. Our Athena Swan Self-Assessment Team sits quarterly. Each group within the\\n School community is represented, ensuring that our Athena Swan action plan meets the needs\\n of the diverse community it serves.\\n The school fosters an environment of inclusivity through leadership, education and celebration of\\n diversity adjoined to key national events including annual Ada Lovelace day, celebrating women\\n in STEM, celebration of pioneers in computer science from the LGBTQ+ community and delivery\\n of on campus events (e.g. film nights) during Black History month.\\n During REF2021 preparations, the University supported employees to voluntarily declare\\n relevant personal circumstances and their impact on REF outputs [REF5a-3.7], while\\n maintaining confidentiality. All staff involved in REF preparations completed a training course\\n covering EDI legislation and principles governing REF conduct, protected characteristics,\\n unconscious bias, and management strategies for positive outcomes. All researchers were\\n asked to nominate as many outputs as they thought eligible for inclusion for REF2021 to our\\n annual internal review process, and all were encouraged to put forward impact case studies\\n (ICSs). Our strategy is to submit the very best outputs and ICSs regardless of other criteria.\\n 2.4 Concordat Implementation\\n The University of Nottingham is a signatory, through Universities UK, of the Concordat to\\n Support the Development of Researchers and holds an HR Excellence in Research award from\\n the EC. Local implementation of the Nottingham Concordat Plan [REF5a-3.2] is ensured through\\n the inclusion in the School management team of the roles of Director of Research and Director\\n of Staff Development, who are directly tasked with supporting the career development of the\\n School’s researchers. The ADC process is applied uniformly to research and academic staff,\\n                                                                                             Page 13\\n\\n\\n researchers are invited to School Staff Meetings and PhD and research staff make up 1/3 of the\\n EDI committee.\\n Data Protection training is compulsory for all University staff, and refresher training was\\n mandated on the introduction of GDPR legislation, with completion monitored via personalised\\n links. All work conducted using personal data undergoes ethical approval. As a member of the\\n UK Research Integrity Office (UKRIO), the University has access to training provision of UKRIO\\n on research integrity and organised research integrity workshops for academic staff and\\n research students from 2017. Responsible Research and Innovation training is provided by the\\n Institute of Science and Society at the University, one of the foremost interdisciplinary centres for\\n research excellence in the field of science and technology studies.\\n 3. Income, Infrastructure and facilities\\n 3.1. Research Income\\n In the REF period research income to the School totalled £33M, an average of £4.7M p.a., up\\n from £3.9M p.a. in 2014. Staff have been investigators on grants resulting in £70.9M of income\\n to the University, up from £52M in 2014. We receive funding from a wide range of sources\\n including EPSRC, BBSRC, MRC, NERC, AHRC, InnovateUK, European Commission, US Govt.,\\n charitable bodies and industry.\\n The School leads or contributes substantially to key strategic projects, including:\\n      \\uf0b7 the EPSRC-funded Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute, which received a £4.1M\\n          renewal in 2020, bringing its total funding to £20.7M.\\n      \\uf0b7 Nottingham’s £14.2M EPSRC/BBSRC Synthetic Biology Research Centre.\\n      \\uf0b7 the £23.6M NIHR-funded Biomedical Research Centre led by UoN and Nottingham\\n          University Hospitals Trust.\\n Other notable awards are:\\n      \\uf0b7 UnBias: Emancipating Users Against Algorithmic Biases for a Trusted Digital Economy\\n          (£1.3M, EPSRC); followed by ReEntrust (£218K, EPSRC) [REF3 ICS: Protecting the\\n          Rights of Young People].\\n      \\uf0b7 Living with Digital Ubiquity (£1.2M EPSRC Platform Grant to MRL).\\n      \\uf0b7 Defence against Dark Artefacts (£1.1M, EPSRC).\\n      \\uf0b7 SAGE (€2M European Commission, coordinated by Nottingham).\\n      \\uf0b7 Leveraging the Multi-Stakeholder Nature of Cyber Security (£770K, EPSRC).\\n      \\uf0b7 Health Data Research UK (£724K, UKRI, Wellcome).\\n 3.1.1. PhD Training\\n PhD funding centres upon the twice-renewed (total £14.9M) EPSRC-funded Horizon CDT;\\n Nottingham remains the only institution with both a Digital Economy Research Hub and CDT.\\n The renewed CDT will also benefit from over £4.7M in cash and in-kind contributions from\\n industry and academic partners, demonstrating external commitment to its work.\\n In addition, Ozcan is partner in two Marie Curie ITN awards led by Nottingham – No2Noise\\n (€809K) and OptiMACS (€1.3M) - supporting PhDs across engineering and computer science.\\n 3.1.2. Enabling the Wider Community\\n In line with our goal of extending intra- and inter-disciplinary collaboration, the School actively\\n seeks funding for transdisciplinary networking:\\n                                                                                                Page 14\\n\\n\\n     \\uf0b7    John (COL) was co-investigator on the £1.4M EPSRC NetworkPlus Digitally Enhanced\\n          Advanced Services (DEAS). DEAS focusses on how digital products and services are\\n          used, cascading over £600K to researchers spanning business, computer science and\\n          human factors to stimulate engagement in a coordinated programme of research pilots.\\n     \\uf0b7    Pridmore (CVL) holds a £528K UKRI Technology Touching Life grant to establish a\\n          national network promoting a holistic approach to plant phenotyping.

Research\\n                                                                                              Page 15\\n\\n\\n groups are allocated specific areas of the building, ensuring staff and PhDs are co-located and\\n allowing groups to manage and adapt their space. MRL, for example, has a large open,\\n configurable space equivalent to 8 large offices plus corridor space which allows the creation\\n and study of large facilities [REF3 ICS: Innovating Cultural Products]. CVL has a dedicated\\n laboratory used to develop robot systems and a ‘virtual’ human which can recognise e.g. facial\\n expression, gaze and tone of voice.\\n Computer Science provides nine meeting and collaborative working spaces, bookable by staff\\n and students and including projectors and video-conferencing. Since 2014 we have invested\\n £15K in facilities for these rooms and committed a further £30K in collaborative working\\n equipment, ensuring that staff and students have access to the latest technology.\\n The School has invested heavily in internal network infrastructure during the REF period,\\n including the renewal of high specification servers running research tasks and creation of an in-\\n house high-performance computing facility for staff and student work. Our in-house technical\\n and IT service comprises three highly qualified technicians who support research in the School\\n through close liaison with research staff.\\n Specialist research equipment is provided within both the School and the wider University. Smart\\n Products’ dedicated Cobot Maker Space includes a cobot room equipped with human-friendly\\n robots allowing up to four human-robot collaboration studies to run simultaneously while\\n gathering data from sensors including thermal cameras, brain scanners and gaze trackers.\\n Creation of this space is made possible by a £632K EPSRC and University investment, while the\\n School’s devolved budgets have allowed CVL to construct a cluster of nine multi-GPU enabled\\n servers with associated network storage and scheduling software. This facility is designed to\\n support work in deep machine learning and has facilitated development of novel and highly\\n successful convolutional neural network architectures. CVL is a partner UoN’s unique Hounsfield\\n Facility, which provides state-of-the-art imaging facilities supporting their work in plant\\n phenotyping.\\n The University has invested substantially in High Performance Computing, launching a new HPC\\n service (Augusta) in 2018 (REF5a-4.1(d)). The service now provides 4,720 cores, 31TB RAM, 8\\n GPUs and 750TB of storage. A charging model for use ensures long-term sustainability and the\\n School is provided with an annual budget of £30K (equivalent to 2,000,000 core hours) for HPC\\n activity not funded by other sources, ensuring that the service is widely available. The University\\n is also a member of the HPC Midlands Plus consortium which allows users at the Universities of\\n Aston, Birmingham, Leicester, Loughborough, Nottingham, Queen Mary and Warwick to access\\n further high performance facilities across the region.\\n UoN facilitates cloud computing solutions through Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and\\n Google Cloud Platform. This reduces waiting times and allows staff and students to complete\\n tasks requiring more cores than are available on site. These services are managed by the\\n University’s Digital Research Services department; each Faculty has a dedicated representative\\n assisting in their use and handling requests for new or extended services. Secure, GDPR-\\n compliant data storage facilities are also available. Research projects with significant data\\n storage needs can access the University’s Central Performance facility, which offers up to 5TB\\n free with a subsequent nominal cost per terabyte.\\n A comprehensive range of central services support the development of proposals, project\\n finances, business engagement, IT and infrastructure support, digital research support and\\n technology transfer and commercialisation. The School supplements this with a Director of\\n Operations, a Research and Operations manager (a post created during this REF period), a\\n Research Administration Manager, Research Officers and Operations Administrators.\\n                                                                                              Page 16\\n\\n\\n The Advanced Data Analysis Centre (ADAC) was founded in 2012 to further increase the impact\\n of the School’s research on data manipulation and analysis. It remained part of the School until\\n 2018 when, supported by £300K from the University’s Strategic Research Board and renamed\\n the Digital Research Service REF5a-4.1(d), it became independent of the School structure while\\n maintaining its presence in Computer Science. ADAC/DRS’s mission is to provide both a service\\n to Nottingham scientists needing access to data analysis and a conduit for the transfer of new\\n techniques to other disciplines. DRS now employs 23 staff, up from six in 2014.\\n 4. Collaboration and Contribution to the research base, economy and society\\n Our strategy of grounding core computer science in real-world challenges and settings has led to\\n collaborations with a wide range of commercial, public and third-sector partners, as evidenced\\n by the diversity of our four ICSs [REF3]. Supported by the University’s Technology Transfer\\n Team, our research has had demonstrable impact in a diverse range of sectors including\\n Government and policy, healthcare and medicine, logistics, food and agriculture, aerospace,\\n creative industries, retail, energy, finance, biomedical and manufacturing.\\n 4.1. Partnership on Research Grants\\n COL continues its unique relationship with NATS, refining the take-off time prediction system\\n which has been operational at Heathrow since 2012 and developing and implementing a new\\n departure management system which is further reducing delays and improving recovery from\\n delay incidents [REF3 ICS: Improving Operations at London Heathrow and Geneva Airports]. EU\\n projects have allowed the School to engage with research users in developing and testing\\n research solutions in real-world environments, companies the School has collaborated with on\\n EU projects include Laing O’Rourke, Dassault Systemes, Alstom Transport, SimPlan and\\n Smarter Grid Solutions.\\n 4.2. KTPs and Industry-funded Research\\n During the REF period the School has held 9 KTP awards with a total value of £1.85M. These\\n have embedded the School’s research into the industrial practice of Krow, E.On, EventMAP,\\n PXTech, Intechnica, 121 Systems, Optrack, JP Morgan and Gleeds. IMA have continued their\\n relationship with the National Cyber Security Centre, part of GCHQ, and have received two\\n instances of funding; to support a programme of software development and to facilitate an\\n international workshop around handing uncertainty in data and decision-making hosted in\\n Nottingham. The School has received direct research funding from Huawei, Google, Adobe,\\n Syngenta, Diamond Light Source, Meograph, Microsoft Research, NATS and Unilever during\\n this REF period, to a total value of £3.53M (9.2% of award income).\\n 4.3. Spin-outs and Start-ups\\n Blue Skeye AI (Valstar) was successfully spun out, with £235K venture capital. Blue Skeye has\\n met its OEM targets each year, now employs 7 staff (2 further posts advertised) and has\\n contracts worth £360K in its development pipeline.\\n Three further start-ups are linked to the School’s research: Studio Go Go (Walker, previously\\n Senior Research Fellow, MRL), Makers of Imaginary Worlds (Patel, PhD, MRL), and Userfy\\n (Sam Howard PhD student in Human Computer Interaction).\\n                                                                                            Page 17\\n\\n\\n 4.4. PhD Training\\n Collaboration with industry is a vital element of the Nottingham PhD experience, and embedded\\n in the Horizon CDT. Each Horizon CDT student undertakes an internship (e.g. with Ordnance\\n Survey, DSTL, Experian, Nottingham Contemporary). Diamond Light Source, The Roslin\\n Institute and Microsoft Research are each funding a PhD student and Unilever are supporting an\\n EPSRC iCase studentship.\\n 4.5. Engaging Citizens\\n The public are the ultimate beneficiaries of our research and much of the School’s work engages\\n with the public at some point. Collaborations with artists and cultural institutions have toured\\n galleries, festivals and museums in 22 cities around the world, have been directly experienced\\n by 40,000 people and indirectly by thousands more online and have received media coverage\\n on BBC Radio 4’s Saturday Review, BBC News Click, BBC1 East News, ITV East Anglia News\\n [REF3 ICS: Innovating Cultural Products].\\n MRL was commissioned to produce four Artcode pieces to be displayed in the Royal Marsden\\n Hospital’s Teenage Cancer Trust Unit, building on work from the EPSRC-funded grant ‘Living\\n with Interactive Decorative Patterns’. This work has also been applied in the ‘Ice Age to Digital\\n Age’ strand of the Nenescape project to celebrate, protect and conserve the natural and built\\n environments of the River Nene Regional Park.\\n CDT student Ramchurn’s brain-controlled film, The Moment, has been featured on BBC Click\\n and has toured film festivals in the UK and across Europe.\\n Our research on airport scheduling [REF3 ICS: Improving Operations at London Heathrow and\\n Geneva Airports] has been featured on BBC4’s The Secret Rules of Modern Living: Algorithms.\\n MRL work on a project with the School of Law, Corrupt Kitchen, which raises awareness of food\\n hygiene and safety and explores workplace attitudes towards corruption using virtual reality was\\n featured on BBC East Midlands Today. Corrupt Kitchen was also demonstrated at an event held\\n by Just Eat where several hundred food industry professionals had the opportunity to try the VR\\n experience.\\n Tzimiropoulos’ work on 3D face modelling from a single image received national media coverage\\n including BBC TV interviews and articles in e.g. Mail Online. An online demonstration generated\\n >1.5M 3D faces from images uploaded by the public, and 3D prints generated by the method\\n have been exhibited in art galleries.\\n The School’s Computerphile YouTube channel hosts bespoke videos presenting our research\\n and its context to the general public. Computerphile benefitted from funding from Microsoft\\n Research and John Warnock (co-founder of Adobe) during the REF period and received its\\n YouTube ‘Golden Button’ for 1 million subscribers in 2018. Computerphile now has 1.72M million\\n subscribers and has received over 136 million video views. YouTube also commissioned the\\n Computerphile team to produce a set of bespoke videos in the area of data analysis.\\n 4.6. Widening Participation in Computer Science.\\n The School is an active part of the academic community in Nottingham and works with local\\n schools and other institutions to engage communities which may not traditionally have identified\\n with Computer Science.

      "['University of Southampton\\n Unit of Assessment: 11 Computer Science and Informatics\\n 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n 1.1 Overview\\n The School of Electronics and Computer Science (ECS) has 95 academic (CAT A) staff\\n (including 39 professors) split across UoAs 11 and 12, of which 51 staff (20%F) are being\\n returned in UoA11. Situated in the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, ECS,\\n established in 1947, is the oldest school of its kind in the UK and has an annual economy of\\n £46M (£25M for UoA11). The interdisciplinary nature of ECS reflects its highly interconnected\\n and collaborative philosophy. UoA11 draws especially upon, and benefits from, numerous other\\n disciplines as evidenced below. This is a key element to our strong environment, both for the\\n generation of new insights and for the translation of fundamental research into meaningful\\n economic, societal and human impact. Our environment has resulted in key achievements over\\n the past REF period, including:\\n      •   An influential government artificial intelligence (AI) review entitled “Growing the AI\\n          Industry in the UK”, which has shaped the government’s AI agenda (§4.2.1).\\n      •   The only computer science (CS) Regius professor chair in the UK.\\n      •   Renewal of the GCHQ Cyber Security Academy Centre of Excellence.\\n      •   3 new interdisciplinary centres around AI, digital health and the internet of things (IoT).\\n      •   A £1.5M Shell-funded centre with engineering focusing on digital maritime.\\n      •   Over £40M funding awarded to UoA11 including a CDT, 2 EPSRC platform grants and\\n          leading the £12M (total value) UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) Hub.\\n      •   Over the REF period, we increased the percentage of female academic staff in CS from\\n          11% to 20%, and of female PGR students from 26% to 32%.\\n The Unit is wholly situated in ECS with academic staff split across five research groups for line\\n management purposes. As shown in Table 1, AIC brings together pioneering research in AI,\\n human-computer systems, complexity science and health/wellbeing. CPS undertakes research\\n covering electronics and computer science that enables advances in engineering of cyber-\\n physical systems. CSY brings together interdisciplinary expertise in whole-systems security\\n bridging software, hardware and human factors. VLC produces internationally leading research\\n in machine learning and computer vision. WAIS studies socio-technical systems at scale, using\\n a combination of data, computational and social science methods to understand interactions\\n among information systems that compose the Web and the Internet. Two groups, VLC and CPS,\\n are split with UoA12.\\n                                      Table 1: Research Groups\\n                      Group                             Head          UoA11 Count        UoA11 FTE\\n   Agents, Interaction and Complexity (AIC)       Norman                15 (4F/11M)          14.96\\n   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)                   Gunn                   5 (0F/5M)            5.00\\n   Cybersecurity (CSY)                            Sassone                7 (1F/6M)            6.40\\n   Vision, Learning and Control (VLC)             Prugel-Bennett        10 (1F/9M)            8.80\\n   Web and Internet Science (WAIS)                Carr                  14 (4F/10M)          12.10\\n   Total                                                               51 (10F/41M)          47.26\\n                                                                                                  Page 1\\n\\n\\n In addition, there are three cross-cutting interdisciplinary research centres with UoA11 staff\\n members: Centre for Machine Intelligence (CMI, Ramchurn), the Centre for Internet of Things\\n and Pervasive Systems (CIoT, Merrett), and the Centre for Health Technology (CHT, Chapman\\n & White).\\n UoA11 is also leading the recently established interdisciplinary UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous\\n Systems (TAS) Hub, in collaboration with King’s College London and University of Nottingham\\n (https://www.tas.ac.uk/, Ramchurn (PI), Butler, Chapman, Evers, Hall (Co-Is)).\\n Also, several long-standing University-wide centres are led by UoA11 staff. The Web Science\\n Institute (WSI, Directors: Carr & Hall (WAIS) and Leonard (Sociology)) is jointly led by UoA11\\n and social sciences. ECS is also home to both the UKRI-funded Software Sustainability Institute\\n (SSI, PI: Carr) the world-leading hub for research software best practice, and the Southampton\\n Research Software Group (RSG) which has a similar role but at the local level. Southampton is\\n also home to one of 19 National Academic Centres of Excellence in Cyber Security Research\\n (ACE-CSR), led by Sassone, recognising Southampton as an internationally leading institute for\\n research on cybersecurity. ECS is furthermore home to the IT Innovation Centre which focuses\\n on enterprise and applied research, and its staff are on enterprise contracts (rather than\\n balanced pathways, REF5a§3.1). Finally, since 2018, Southampton is a member of the Alan\\n Turing Institute (ATI) which has strong engagement from UoA11.

We identified the need to establish a new interdisciplinary group in Cyber Security and\\n a refocusing of the CPS group (formerly Electronic and Software Systems). A clear need to\\n develop additional cross-cutting research centres was also identified. This led to CMI, CIoT\\n (which evolved from the existing Pervasive Systems Centre) and CHT, along with continuing\\n centres delivering research excellence, impact, industry collaborations and funding.\\n Another important development has been the retirement of senior academics (e.g. Poppleton\\n and Wald) and some of our top academics taking up prestigious positions elsewhere (e.g.\\n Shadbolt became Principal of Jesus College, Oxford in 2015 and Jennings became Vice-\\n Provost at Imperial in 2016). Our strategy has been to replace these positions by predominantly\\n early career researchers (ECRs). Indeed, 22 (6F/16M) of the 51 UoA11 returned staff were hired\\n over the REF period, of which 18 (6F/12M) were ECRs. Despite fewer senior staff, we were able\\n to achieve and, in some cases, exceed our targets. Our aims following REF2014 were:\\n                                                                                               Page 2\\n\\n\\n Aim 1: Deliver excellent science.\\n Over the REF period we have published almost 2000 research papers (conferences and\\n journals). One indication of quality is the assessment of those indexed by Scopus, where 47%\\n were in the top 25% (by CiteScore Percentile), and 83% in the top 50%, with papers in these\\n categories increasing over the past 2-3 years. Our overall field-weighted citation impact was\\n 1.67 in 2018, and 1.99 in 2019, compared to 1.48 average over 2014-2019, with around 19% in\\n the top 10% for citations. Despite fewer staff we attracted more than £47M of new grant awards\\n (§3.2).\\n Aim 2: Address major societal challenges.\\n We have restructured our groups and created the cross-cutting centres focusing on major\\n challenges, including AI, cyber security, IoT and healthcare. These centres have led to some\\n significant success such as the £12M TAS Hub and £1.5M Shell-funded Centre for Maritime\\n Futures (CMF) (§3.1), the development of which have been enabled by collaborative activities\\n organised by CMI. The TAS Hub will address the societal issues around AI, and responsible\\n innovation. The focus of the CMF is to use digital technologies including AI to reduce carbon\\n emissions from shipping.\\n Aim 3: Maximise research impact.\\n We have extensively engaged with University-level services including Public Policy\\n Southampton (PP|S), Public Engagement with Research unit (PERu), Future Worlds,\\n SetSquared (REF5a§2.3), increased our consultancy income (39 organisations; £2.1M income),\\n and initiated new partnerships with industry and government (§4). In addition, we attracted more\\n than £12M of impact-oriented funding including industry funding (§3.2).\\n Aim 4: Develop research leaders.\\n Following the research strategy set out in REF2014, we have continued investment in CS and\\n appointed 131 research staff (26%F:74%M), of which 25 were senior research fellows, lecturers\\n and above (32%F:68%M). There were 18 promotions over the REF period.\\n During the last REF period ECS proposed to grow the size of our Graduate School. In addition to\\n core EPSRC DTP and additional school funding (§2.2), an important part of the training strategy\\n included the establishment of Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs). These include the UKRI-\\n funded centres: Web Science (EP/L016117/1) and Next-Generation Computational Modelling\\n (EP/L015382/1, led by Engineering) which both started in 2014, as well as the recent Machine\\n Intelligence for Nano-electronic Devices and Systems (MINDS) CDT (EP/S024298/1, started\\n April 2019) and AI for the Future of Society (AIFS, jointly funded by ECS and industry). This\\n strategy has led to an increase in the number of students being awarded PhDs, from an average\\n 28/year in REF2014 to 34/year in REF2021.\\n 1.3 Future research strategy\\n Our ambition for UoA11 centres around four key pillars:\\n 1. Enterprise\\n Establishing and sustaining long-term partnerships with industry and government organisations\\n remains a key strategy. Partnership links are established and fostered in many ways, including\\n through consultancy, Industry Days, KTPs, and engagement with ECS and University\\n interdisciplinary institutes (REF5a§2.6) as well as other organisations within the University such\\n as Research and Innovation Services (RIS). We will continue supporting our interdisciplinary\\n centres, regularly revisiting them to see if refocusing is needed. We will further build\\n collaborations between the IT Innovation centre and the research groups on application-focused\\n grants. Furthermore, we maintain our 50% PhD funding pledge (§2.2.1), whereby the costs of\\n studentships are shared between ECS and external partners, to foster long-term collaborations\\n with industry.\\n                                                                                               Page 3\\n\\n\\n 2. Grow research base in key areas\\n We will continue to build on our research strengths including formal methods, cybersecurity (e.g.\\n through CSY group and ACE-CSR) the internet of things (e.g. through the CPS group and CIoT),\\n and expand in the following areas:\\n AI and autonomous systems. Central to this will be the TAS Hub with a strong focus on\\n human-centred AI. The research from this newly established hub will build on extensive\\n expertise in this area, including the award-winning ORCHID programme (§4). The hub is led by\\n Southampton establishing a UK-wide collaborative platform to deliver world-leading best practice\\n for the design, regulation and operation of ‘socially beneficial’ autonomous systems which are\\n both trustworthy in principle, and trusted in practice by individuals, society and government. This\\n strand of research will be further supported through Stein’s recent prestigious £1.4M Turing\\n Fellowship award on Citizen-Centric AI Systems (EP/V022067/1), as well as our connection to\\n the ATI. The CMI will continue to play a key role in developing and shaping the AI agenda in\\n ECS and across the University, and we aim to appoint a new chair in human-centred AI.\\n Healthcare and wellbeing. This research will build on our extensive existing work and\\n established links, such as schraefel’s prestigious EPSRC Fellowship on building a healthy\\n nation (§3.2). The CHT will play an important role to form new collaborations and expand\\n research funding in this area. There will be an increased emphasis on data-driven approaches\\n for healthcare, driven by our recent NHS Digital Security Toolkit accreditation which enables the\\n processing of pseudonymised NHS data (§4.1). Applications include improved health systems\\n operations management, drug discovery, and precision and personalised medicine.\\n 3. Training the next generation\\n Training PhD students remains core to maintaining a vibrant research community. Our aim is to\\n continue training high-quality PhD students through the two CDTs led by ECS (MINDS and\\n Future Society), as well as DTP funding. We will use the DTP funding to support strategic\\n Faculty initiatives, including studentships for new cross-disciplinary research centres, improve\\n the proportion of DTP funding allocated to ECR supervisors, and improve the use of the 50%\\n rule (where costs are shared with industry investment). We will also take steps to improve the\\n rates of thesis submission within the funding period and implement measures to further improve\\n on equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI).\\n 4. Increase the number and quality of UKRI submitted proposals and fellowships\\n Although we have met our targets for overall funding over the past REF period, we see\\n opportunities to continue to improve our success rates. To this end, we will improve our\\n mentoring and workshop initiatives, and deliver an improved internal review process, where\\n each proposal is reviewed by two independent academics. In addition, we are discussing ways\\n to reduce teaching loads for staff preparing proposals.\\n 1.4 Impact strategy\\n ECS has developed a comprehensive strategy to cultivate, coordinate and establish a broad\\n range of activities that delivers economic, institutional, and societal benefits to both University\\n and non-academic partners. The strategy aims to increase industry funded partnerships of all\\n types, fostering a culture that supports translation of theory to practice. We actively support staff\\n to pursue significant impact activities through reductions in other duties. Staff can also take short\\n term secondments to industry, or part-time buy-out from the University (§2.1).\\n The ECS strategy for enabling impact is facilitated through a wide range of activities and\\n engagement in interdisciplinary research: long-term partnerships with industry fostered by, for\\n example, the Cyber Security Academy and the ATI; the aforementioned ECS Centres (CMI,\\n CIoT, CHT); dedicated impact champion, enterprise director and committees to advise on\\n strategy including incentivisation for enterprise activity by staff and students; an Industrial\\n Advisory Board (IAB), which includes senior representatives from technology-focused\\n companies and provides guidance on education, research and enterprise strategy; a\\n consultancy unit, ECS partners, and many University-level partnerships and initiatives\\n (REF5a§2), including Future Worlds, SETsquared, Z21, RIS and PP|S, some of which are led by\\n                                                                                                 Page 4\\n\\n\\n and/or originated from ECS and all of which have contributed to the impact agenda. Z21 is a\\n partnership between the University of Southampton (UoS) and the Solent Local Enterprise\\n Partnership (LEP) supporting the development of Minimum Viable Products (MVP) and providing\\n pre-seed funding.\\n Our impact case studies (ICSs) benefited from the ECS approach to impact. For example, w.r.t\\n ICS11-04, our approach to interdisciplinary research (§1.5) led to a collaboration between\\n UoA11 and UoA4, where behaviour interventions through the Royal College of Nursing resulted\\n in reduced occurrence of hand dermatitis, and a reduction of antibiotic prescriptions in the UK\\n and internationally. The promotion of open research and research integrity (§1.6) and the\\n industrial links with the Ordnance Survey and others enabled wide impact with open image\\n capturing and analysis libraries in ICS11-06. Collaboration with the Open Data Institute, the\\n interdisciplinary Web Science Institute, and the leading role that ECS academics have in the\\n Web Science Trust network of laboratories (§1.6), enabled the development of two data-driven\\n innovation incubators, ODINE and DataPitch in ICS11-07; those have been independently\\n assessed to have contributed to the creation of 896 jobs and unlocked €132.4M in revenues in\\n the UK and Europe. The promotion of open research and research integrity (§1.6), and industrial\\n engagement via ECS Partners enabled £0.6M commercial income for consulting and training to\\n businesses on software verification and achieved widespread use of open-source software\\n modelling and verification tools as detailed in ICS11-09.\\n Going forwards, we will maintain our existing strong culture for generating impact through\\n established structures and organisations. We will reflect tangible and significant impact activities\\n in the workload model and provide incentivisation and resources for these activities. We will\\n continue to use Future Worlds as the preferred vehicle for marketing ECS research with impact\\n potential, encouraging the costing of Future Worlds support in grant applications. We aim to\\n provide a comprehensive overview of schemes and support to generate impact, including\\n different options for commercialisation and blueprints for spinouts. In addition, we plan to\\n develop further mentoring and training especially for PhD students and postdoctoral researchers\\n around responsible research and innovation (RRI) and non-academic impact, using the MINDS\\n CDT as a model. The MINDS iPhD programme integrates RRI and impact training and practice\\n throughout, embedding a culture of impact early on. Students learn to think about impact on\\n policy, society and the economy and how to communicate effectively with a wide variety of\\n stakeholders. This training, along with the CDT Outreach Ambassadors programme, will be\\n rolled out across ECS with a view to influencing PhD and research staff development across the\\n institution.\\n 1.5 Interdisciplinarity\\n Collaborative research across disciplines is at the heart of our research philosophy and is\\n evident within our group structures, where two of our groups (VLC and CPS) and our centres\\n (especially CIoT and CHT) have academic members from both UoA11 and UoA12. These\\n collaborative links are not isolated to groups, however, as illustrated by the EPSRC platform\\n grant “Wearable and Autonomous Computing for Future Smart Cities” (EP/P010164/1), which\\n recognises sustained interdisciplinary research excellence across AIC, CPS and the Smart\\n Electronic Materials and Systems (SEMS, UoA12) groups, and the MINDS CDT which involves\\n CS and nanotechnology and combines forces between AIC and the Zepler Institute for\\n Photonics and Nanoelectronics. We also have close collaborations with the rest of engineering,\\n as evidenced by the Shell-funded Centre for Maritime Futures, a collaboration between CMI and\\n SMMI.\\n                                                                                               Page 5\\n\\n\\n                 Figure 2: Southampton Publications by Subject Area for UoA11\\n                                  Source: Scopus, December 2020.\\n Interdisciplinarity extends beyond engineering. Figure 2 shows that over 50% of papers are\\n cross-disciplinary. Over 25% of the new awards over the past REF period are shared with other\\n UoAs within the University (§3.2), and 39% of our PhD students are co-supervised with other\\n UoAs.\\n 1.6 Open research and research integrity\\n ECS, specifically UoA11, is at the forefront of open science, data ethics and governance. The\\n first of 18 recommendations from Hall’s AI review addresses the need to facilitate safe data-\\n sharing by the creation of data trusts, which led to activities on standards for data trusts within\\n the Royal Society and the Law Society of London. Also, Hall has been named Chair of the Ada\\n Lovelace Institute for data ethics. Others, including O’Hara, Tiropanis, Simperl and schraefel\\n have influenced policy around data governance (§4.2.1).\\n ECS has championed many open data initiatives. Shadbolt launched the Open Data Institute in\\n 2011 and EPrints, developed by ECS 20 years ago, is the world’s leading open-source digital\\n repository platform, having been adopted by 675+ institutional and subject repositories world-\\n wide (REF5a§2.3). The Web Observatory (https://www.webscience.org/web-observatory/) was\\n developed by academics from the WAIS group towards a global catalogue of datasets,\\n applications and projects related to research on the Web, in collaboration with laboratories in the\\n Web Science Trust network and the Worldwide Universities Network. Simperl led ODINE (2015-\\n 2017), an EU-funded incubator for open data businesses, followed by the EU-funded Data Pitch\\n open innovation programme to encourage corporate and public-sector organisations to share\\n data with start-ups and SMEs that work with data (see ICS11-07). In addition, three other ICSs\\n have achieved impact through the development of open-source software: ICS11-04 (tools for\\n behavioural interventions), ICS11-6 (image processing and analysis tools) and ICS11-09 (formal\\n modelling and verification tools). Furthermore, ECS has contributed to creating free and open\\n training materials about digital accessibility with wide reach (§4.2.2). Finally, both SSI and RSG\\n champion the use of open software within the University and the UK, for example, collaborating\\n with the Wellcome Trust on openness of software and producing parts of the Trust’s funding\\n policy on this subject.\\n Regarding research integrity, all research involving human subjects and data, including projects\\n using social media and secondary data sources, is reviewed by the Faculty Research Ethics\\n Committee (FREC), applying University Ethics procedures (REF5a§2.8). All staff and PhD\\n students undertake mandatory Faculty-wide training in ethics and research integrity.\\n Reproducible research practices are strongly encouraged with researcher staff, academics and\\n research students alike publishing code and datasets via EPrints with library assigned DOIs. The\\n                                                                                                 Page 6\\n\\n\\n University is a signatory to the Concordat for Research Integrity, and there is a dedicated\\n concordat group in ECS with representation from each research group.\\n 2. People\\n 2.1 Staffing strategy and staff development\\n 2.1.1 Recruitment policy\\n The staffing strategy is implemented through a regular review process and outcomes are\\n incorporated into the Faculty Strategic Plan. A central tenet of our procedures revolves around\\n seeking the best talent worldwide, and subsequently developing tomorrow’s research leaders.\\n CS has seen a growth in areas of AI and cyber-security, and we have made strategic\\n appointments in these areas including Hu (M) who is a leader in cyber physical hardware\\n security, Norman (M) who is a leader in multi-agent systems, and Staab (M) who is a leader in\\n semantic web. In addition, our focus has been on nurturing and attracting talented ECRs\\n including those from leading universities and companies in the world: Oxford: Konstantinidis\\n (M), Marchioni (M), Zhang (M), Atamli (M); Bristol: Rastegari (F), York: Tarapore (M);\\n Imperial: Evers (F), Karafili (F); UCL: Cai (M); Surrey: Kim (M); CMU: Sogokon (M); Rome:\\n Aniello (M); Goldsmiths: Farrahi (F); MITRE Corp.: Chapman (F, recently promoted to full\\n professor). By having an environment that recognises the potential of outstanding, home-grown\\n researchers, appointments have also been made from the best of our own: Hoang (M), Hare\\n (M), Packer (F), Ibanez Gonzalez (M) and Middleton (M, originally on an enterprise pathway in\\n the IT Innovation group).\\n Ensuring diversity is a key part of our recruitment strategy has led to significant changes to our\\n policies. Marketing and advertising are written in gender-neutral language to equally represent\\n male and female traits, and we have family-friendly policies supporting flexible/part-time working\\n (§2.1.4). Candidates from under-represented groups are proactively approached and\\n encouraged to apply. All shortlisting and interview panels are mixed gender. Membership of the\\n interview panel is proscribed by role within the University and recent panels have included at\\n least two women (chair and group representative). As a result, since 2014, female academic\\n staff in UoA11 has grown from 11% in 2013/14 to 20% in 2019/20, which is well above the\\n Russell Group benchmark (14%). Over the same period, the proportion of BAME academic staff\\n has grown from 9% to 25%.\\n 2.1.2 Supporting early career researchers\\n The standard balanced pathway for academics has a 40/40/20 teaching/research/admin\\n workload. However, newly appointed academic staff have a reduced teaching load for the first 3\\n years with a gradual increase from 40% to 100% of their normal teaching load. They are all\\n appointed mentors, allocated a PhD DTP studentship and £5k start-up. ECRs are given priority\\n in the allocation of studentships. New staff work with their Head of Group/line manager during\\n probation on a comprehensive personal research plan and, regardless of level, are supported by\\n a senior academic colleague from within their research group who provides dedicated support\\n and guidance. In addition, ECRs are encouraged to engage with the ECS Mentoring\\n Programme, through which we match those seeking more focussed support in areas of interest,\\n such as seeking funding or outreach. The mentoring initiative is led by the Senior Mentor, who\\n reports to the ECS Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Committee. Mentoring is a confidential\\n process, intended to be a separate activity from regular managerial support and induction.\\n New staff are also supported through regular workshops covering topics such as finance, non-\\n academic impact and other key aspects of an effective proposal. Successful applicants, more\\n experienced researchers, and senior academic and professional services colleagues facilitate\\n these events, with follow-up typically supported through ECS Mentoring. ECS also has an\\n internal Grant Review Scheme in which all applications receive detailed feedback from two\\n academics. In 2018 we introduced an ECS Fellowship Champion, who runs workshops to\\n promote fellowships (including talks by female fellowship holders), and mentors applicants. ECS\\n                                                                                               Page 7\\n\\n\\n also runs mock interview panels for those reaching the interview stage of grants/fellowships\\n (uptake 100%).\\n The University is a signatory to the Concordat to Support the Career Development of\\n Researchers. Research Associates (RAs) are encouraged, and enabled, to explore career\\n development opportunities, including workshops on developing a fellowship application, public\\n policy impact, and outreach and public engagement in research. Initiatives such as short-term\\n competitive seed-funding managed through our centres (CMI, CIoT, CHT & WSI) provide a\\n means for research staff to develop research ideas and initiatives that are expected to lead to\\n more significant activities. Additionally, two platform grants (Future Smart Cities and AutoTrust)\\n have Flexible Innovation Funds. Researchers from across ECS can write short, EPSRC-like\\n proposals capturing their own ideas, pitching them to senior academic colleagues, with\\n successful proposals giving RAs the opportunity to plan, work independently on, and lead\\n research projects.\\n 2.1.3 Appraisal, recognition and promotion\\n ECS operates an open workload model that includes all teaching, administration and research\\n duties. Enterprise and impact are explicitly reflected in promotion and seen as an essential part\\n of the strong unit. All academic and research staff are appraised annually by their line manager\\n through a confidential system designed to review their career progression and explicitly consider\\n plans for progression and promotion. The University actively supports the recognition of success\\n through schemes such as the annual Vice Chancellor’s Awards (e.g. Hare), and Early Career\\n Awards (Tran-Thanh).\\n ECS holds an internal review panel that evaluates all submitted applications and provides\\n feedback to applicants. This allows applicants to improve their case prior to formal submission to\\n the Faculty. Unsuccessful candidates are offered continued mentoring support to strengthen\\n their case. Between 2013/14 and 2019/20, eight UoA11 staff were promoted to Associate\\n Professor (8M/0F) and six to Professor (5M/1F). Promotions for women are below what is\\n expected, and we have taken extensive measures to improve the success rate including\\n encouraging more women to apply. Specifically, in 2016 ECS introduced promotion workshops\\n with the aim to better inform staff of both the application process and criteria that need to be\\n satisfied for successful promotion. Since 2019 we have held both mixed and female-only\\n versions of these workshops. See also §2.3. Furthermore, as part of our Athena Swan action\\n plan, we actively identify and nominate female staff for prizes and influential external\\n committees. Participation in committees is strongly supported through appraisal and promotion\\n criteria.\\n 2.1.4 Flexible working and maternity leave\\n The University maternity provision provides up to 52 weeks’ statutory maternity leave\\n (regardless of length of service or contract type). Teaching and supervision are covered by\\n paying postdoctoral fellows who want career experience, employing teaching fellows, or by\\n transferring duties to academic staff who are underloaded. In the most recent instance, the\\n University funded a full-time teaching fellow to cover two staff on maternity, both during their\\n leave and after returning to work. In ECS five periods of maternity leave were taken by UoA11\\n staff between 2013 and 2020. The Faculty has a policy that all ERE staff on fixed-term contracts\\n are eligible to receive fully-funded occupational maternity pay. In 2013 ECS introduced the\\n additional policy that (where the funding body allows) staff can choose to extend their contract\\n rather than hiring in cover, since this is often to their benefit. Up to ten ‘Keeping-in-touch’/ twenty\\n ’Shared parental leave in touch’ (KIT/SPLIT) days are offered, whereby staff can undertake a\\n limited amount of work without affecting statutory pay (e.g. to ease a return to work).\\n Arrangements for return to work are made according to an individual’s level, roles,\\n responsibilities and needs (e.g. a phased return to work can smooth the transition). Teaching\\n and administration are reduced by 70% for the first year following leave to ease the transition\\n and provide extra time to resume research activities. In April 2019 ECS also invested in a\\n permanent ‘quiet room’ for mums to express/breastfeed with facilities to store milk safely.\\n                                                                                                   Page 8\\n\\n\\n The University has a formal Flexible Working Policy which includes a process for considering\\n requests for staff to change working pattern, or to change from/to part-time contracts. Requests\\n to change hours are discussed initially with line-managers. Under research-funded contracts\\n they can be approved by the grant-holder; for Faculty-funded posts Head of School and Faculty\\n approval are required. During the REF period, 23 requests to decrease hours and 26 to increase\\n hours were made and all were approved. The gender break-down of requests (20%F) is in-line\\n with our overall staff profile (19%F).\\n 2.1.5 Merit-based sabbatical programme and secondments\\n Southampton offers the opportunity for sabbatical leave every four years (REF5a§3.2). In ECS,\\n the guidelines for applying include: scope (research plans and measurable objectives);\\n relevance and fit to strategic direction of research (group and individual); funding (staff are\\n encouraged to apply for external funding to support study leave); return from sabbatical and\\n return to normal duties. We also operate an extended sabbatical scheme for secondment or buy-\\n out into companies; e.g. Ramchurn was seconded 50% to North Star Solar from 6/2018 -\\n 6/2019, and 50% to Empati Ltd until 6/2020.\\n 2.2 Research Students\\n 2.2.1 Funding and recruitment\\n Funding of CS students comes from CDTs (Web Science, AI for Future of Society and MINDS\\n CDTs led by CS, and NGCM led by engineering), DTP funds, CASE studentships, industry and\\n other schemes such as the China Scholarship Council (CSC) partnership scheme (whereby the\\n University waves the fees), Southcoast DTP, Spitfire, and EU ITN. Over the REF period, ECS\\n has also allocated additional funding of £220k/year for PGRs over and above the DTP funds\\n (e.g. to cover international fees in order to utilise UKRI flexibility). Industry funding is through\\n CASE studentships and ECS’ matched funding guarantee (50:50 with external funds).\\n When recruiting, we actively approach female applicants especially from our local students. Our\\n Careers Hub Director (F) runs the ECS Careers Hub and, since 2017, we have a “PhD\\n Opportunities in ECS” stand promoting projects and funding. ECS also runs an annual UG\\n Summer Internship Scheme to encourage the pipeline to PhD, funding ~25 students to\\n undertake research in ECS over 12 weeks. Since 2017, we individually contact all female UGs\\n with marks >70% to promote the scheme and prominently feature women in promotional\\n materials. The proportion of awards to female UGs (24% in 2018) exceeds the proportion of\\n females UGs (CS 16%, EEE 13% 2018/19). Over the entire REF period, we recruited more than\\n 300 new PGR students (33%F) and the percentages of female PGR students studying CS have\\n increased from 25% in 2013/14 to 32% in 2019/20.\\n 2.2.2 Monitoring mechanisms and progression\\n The PGR Tracker tool, developed within the ECS Graduate School in the previous REF period,\\n has now been adopted across the University and is seen as an exemplar of best practice for\\n progression monitoring. This enables formal recording of all the training activities undertaken by\\n each student (including compulsory modules on data management, research ethics and EDI, as\\n well as optional modules on everything from Teaching and Demonstrating to Presentation Skills\\n to ECS-specific technical and research-skills modules). The Doctoral Programme Director (DPD)\\n for CS (Hare) together with the Graduate School team use reports from PGR Tracker data to\\n identify potential problems with progression before they become an issue and provide support to\\n students and supervisors. The DPD also provides a monthly progression report, broken down by\\n research group and supervisors, which is discussed at monthly heads of research group\\n meetings.\\n 2.2.3 Skills development and preparation for future career\\n The University Doctoral College, the Faculty Graduate School and ECS provide a broad range of\\n courses to enhance research-centred learning and transferable skills training to optimise the\\n development of postgraduate students. Through Academic Needs Analysis (ANA), each student\\n is provided with a structured and supportive process enabling them to reflect on their own\\n learning and achievements, and to plan for their personal, educational and career development.\\n                                                                                                    Page 9\\n\\n\\n Subject-specific training is delivered at Faculty, School and research group levels, which\\n includes formal lecture courses, seminar programmes, reading groups, through to taking formal\\n UG or PGT modules, etc. Eight Faculty-led PGR modules include research methodologies (with\\n interdisciplinary and experimental methods), responsible research, ethics and outreach. This\\n complements central provision including presentation and writing skills. Our students can also\\n join training programmes, such as the Software carpentry sessions run by SSI. Some CDTs\\n have career-oriented modules and training events such as the MINDS CDT on Impact and\\n Communication Strategies which teaches students about pathways to impact and responsible\\n research and innovation. Students are also encouraged to attend summer schools and doctoral\\n mentoring programs, both local and external.\\n Each ECS PGR student has a personal Research Training Support Grant (RTSG) of\\n £1,200/annum, to present papers at conferences, attend summer schools and buy necessary\\n consumables for research that is not otherwise available. Our students are also encouraged to\\n be actively involved in conferences as volunteers, session organisers and as reviewers.\\n Students often undertake industrial internships or visit different institutions during their research\\n programme with the support of their supervisory team, and have also won funding to transfer\\n knowledge and build impact from their work. For example, Andrew Hill was awarded an EPSRC\\n National Productivity Investment Fund placement grant (2019) to work with the Zoological\\n Society of London for 6 months. Within the MINDS CDT, each student is paired with an industrial\\n partner, and as part of their PhD programme, undertakes an internship with the partner.\\n The Future Worlds start-up accelerator takes a leading role in developing the entrepreneurial\\n skills of our students, providing expert coaching for those developing commercialisation ideas;\\n for example, Daniel Martinho-Corbishley and Jaime Lomeli launched AuraVision and Iris Kramer\\n has launched ArchEO based upon her PhD research. The culture of developing impact from\\n research within ECS is further illustrated by the work of Tim Matthews and Ryal Beal working\\n with Ramchurn to launch the analytics company Sentient Sports (§4.2.3).\\n 2.3 Equality, diversity and inclusion\\n ECS received an Athena SWAN (AS) Bronze award in 2012. While the AS action plan helped\\n deliver changes, initially, the activity was insufficiently embedded in the ECS operational\\n structure. Consequently, we lost our AS Bronze status and created the ECS EDI Committee in\\n 2016/17 to address this. Membership comprises representatives from every major area in ECS,\\n all research groups and job families (REF5a§3.1). The ECS Athena SWAN Self-Assessment\\n Team (SAT) is a subcommittee which focuses on identifying and addressing gender inequality.\\n The Head of School is both a co-chair of the ECS EDI Committee and a member of the SAT.\\n The restructure delivered key initiatives, some of which (e.g. the ECS Mentoring Scheme,\\n promotion workshops, and quiet room) have already been mentioned. Others include\\n International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHTB), Female Staff\\n Forum, Wellbeing Champions, and a new Code of Conduct. The restructuring of the EDI\\n Committee now makes it an integral part of how ECS operates, and the mechanisms in place\\n have proved effective in delivering actions. This is evidenced by our successful 2019 Bronze AS\\n Award. The action plan developed in this submission has been formally adopted by the EDI\\n Committee and approved by ECS Board, with actions distributed to individuals and groups\\n throughout ECS as indicated. We will submit our Silver AS application in 2021.\\n In line with this plan and the University’s REF2021 Code of Practice, REF champions\\n participated in unconscious-bias training sessions. For selecting REF outputs, individual\\n academics proposed up to five papers which were assessed by a minimum of two independent\\n reviewers from other research groups to prevent bias. The reviewers were selected based on\\n group and gender representation and were given a similar number of papers to review. The final\\n selection was done through the University’s outputs optimisation algorithm, with a custom\\n feature to prefer a balance of papers per person and by gender in case of similar scores.\\n                                                                                                 Page 10\\n\\n\\n 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n 3.1 Strategy for generating Income\\n A key element of our funding strategy from REF2014 was to diversify income, drawing upon a\\n wider range of funding sources. This includes supporting new collaborations, particularly across\\n disciplines, by allocating core funding for CIoT, CHT and CMI. The School invests £85K annually\\n on seed funding for research activities, and part of this fund has been used to kick-start these\\n centres. The plans for each of these centres focus on them becoming financially self-sustaining\\n in a similar way to WSI. The centres run regular events, bringing together academics from\\n across the University, industry, government and third sector partners. The CMI Showcase\\n brought together over 200 participants including 60 companies in 2019. Similarly, the CHT has\\n held regular “Clinicians meet Engineers” events. These interdisciplinary events have enabled\\n substantial current and future funding through the MINDS CDT, TAS Hub (commenced\\n 01/09/2020, EP/V00784X/1), the Shell CMF, and HD-Sec (commenced 01/08/2020,\\n EP/V000489/1). We have been successful in extending our funding sources, including\\n Leverhulme Trust, John Templeton Foundation, the DASA, AXA, Shell and NIHR. During the\\n assessment period, we have also played a leading role in the University by establishing a\\n number of strategic partnerships with industry and government partners including Roke Manor,\\n DSTL, Thales and GCHQ.\\n Support for developing proposals is provided at many levels. We strongly engage with the\\n University’s Research and Innovation Services (RIS, REF5a§1.5), who provide training as well\\n as support for EU and UKRI grants, including business engagement officers to support\\n InnovateUK grants and other industry collaborations. The University’s Research Finance Hub\\n provides support for financial planning. We provide additional dedicated training and support\\n within ECS and across the Faculty, including an annual Research Week event with tutorials and\\n Q&A sessions on diverse funding mechanisms. ECS support is particularly focussed on ECRs\\n and colleagues joining us from outside the UK, as well as underrepresented groups. All ECRs,\\n for example, are supported through the process of developing a New Investigator Award (NIA)\\n proposal with one-to-one mentoring, and access to a writing consultant. ECRs have also\\n benefitted from the CPHC “Chair in 10 Years” workshops. Colleagues who have been successful\\n with specific funders or schemes (e.g. Leverhulme, or programme grants) are paired with those\\n planning proposals. Subject-specific mentoring and review is supported through research\\n groups, and ECS has an internal grant reviewing process. This process simulates the real\\n review process, including the allocation of referees and mock interviews. The ECS support is\\n targeted at women by having female role models and speakers, highlighting grant successes by\\n woman, and running events specifically for women. For example, CMI organised a “Women in\\n AI” event in 2019 with high-profile female speakers.\\n 3.2 Major grants\\n Over the REF period, our income expenditure totalled £43M (£5.7M P/A) and we were awarded\\n 166 new grants worth over £47M for UoA11. Our research has been supported by three\\n programme grants: ORCHID (PI Jennings, now Imperial, £5.5M, 2011-2016); SOCIAM (PI\\n Shadbolt, now Oxford, £6.2M, 2012-2015) with continued funding led by Oxford (PI Shadbolt,\\n CI Hall, £2.7M, 2015-2018), PRiME (PI Al-Hashimi, CI Butler, £5.6M, 2013-2018). In 2016,\\n ORCHID won the Collaborate to Innovate award. We have also secured an EPSRC Fellowship\\n for schraefel (£1.6M, 2020-2025) and two platform grants: “Wearable and Autonomous\\n Computing for Future Smart Cities” (PI Beeby (UOA12), CI Ramchurn, £1.4M, 2017-2021), and\\n AutoTrust (PI schraefel, £1.6M, 2018-2023, £886K to Southampton).\\n Research training has been supported by two competitively won CDTs: Web Science Innovation\\n (PI Hall, £3.7M, 2014-2023) and MINDS (PI Norman, £5.8M, 2019-2027).\\n Major interdisciplinary projects include the NERC-funded “Does developmental plasticity\\n influence speciation?” (PI Ezard (UOA7), CI Watson, £1.6M, 2017-2022), EPSRC-funded “Early\\n detection of contact distress for Enhanced performance monitoring and predictive inspection of\\n machines” (PI Wood (UOA12), CI Niranjan, £1.1M, 2019-2022), EPSRC-funded GCRF-funded\\n                                                                                              Page 11\\n\\n\\n “BRECcIA” project (PI Sheffield (UOA14), CI Ramchurn, £5.5M, 2017-2021, £3.6M to\\n Southampton), the EPSRC Network of Excellence “Artificial and Augmented Intelligence for\\n Automated Scientific Discovery” (PI Frey (UoA8), CI Niranjan, £1.2M, 2018-2022), EPSRC-\\n funded “Joining the dots: from data to insight” (PI Brodzki (UoA10, CI Niranjan and includes CIs\\n from UoA10 and UoA5, £1.2M, 2015-2019) and the Shell-funded “Centre for Maritime Futures”\\n (PI Hudson (UOA12), CI Ramchurn/Gerding, £1.5M, 2019-2024).\\n International collaboration is a further characteristic of our research portfolio with more than\\n £22M worth of H2020 EU funding, as well as the US/UK DAIS ITA (PI Stein, £728K, 2016-2021)\\n and the “Centre for Spatial Computational Learning” led by Imperial (CI Hare, £1.2M, 2019-\\n 2022) among others.\\n Substantial impact-oriented funding includes the EPSRC-funded “Software Sustainability\\n Institute” (PI Carr, £3M, 2015-2023), and the H2020 projects “Open Data Incubator Europe” (PI\\n Simperl, now KCL, £4.9M, 2015-2017). New UK industry and central government funding\\n totalled £4.2M including £1.25M Innovate UK funding and £1.3M from industry.\\n 3.3 Facilities and infrastructure\\n We have invested in research laboratories to support both existing research strengths and to\\n directly support the research of ECRs. In 2019, for example, we invested £110K in a new\\n Robotics research lab, including the cost of a TIAGo robotics platform, which supports a range of\\n projects including resilient robotics (Tarapore) and human-robot collaboration (Evers,\\n Ramchurn). The UKRI AI MINDS CDT lab was established in 2019 with £82K of investment\\n from ECS, providing the centre with an environment to support collaborative research and cohort\\n building. We invested in an £70k IoT testbed facility including a £50k contribution from GCHQ.\\n This interdisciplinary multi-purpose environment serves a variety of research activities in the\\n area of cybersecurity and IoT more generally.\\n Compute-intensive research is supported through the IRIDIS cluster. The University invested\\n £50M into this resource over the REF period (REF5a§4.2). Further investment totalling £192K\\n (24 NVidia RTX8000 GPUs across six cluster nodes) has been made jointly by Faculty, ECS\\n and the MINDS CDT for the exclusive use of ECS staff and research students, particularly in\\n support of AI research.\\n 3.4 Impact\\n An important route to impact for our research is through consultancy, supported through a\\n dedicated Business Development Manager (Darlington) and ECS Partners Ltd. UoA11 staff\\n have provided consultancy to over 39 different organisations totalling £2.1M. ECS Partners\\n assists with licencing academic IP and the translation of research via, e.g., the creation of spin-\\n out companies, thus maximising research impact in diverse areas, and supports early routes to\\n market for potential impact cases, including over £0.6M to commercialise a formal verification\\n toolbox developed by Butler and others (§1.4).\\n Economic impact is further facilitated through Future Worlds (REF5a§2.3). This accelerator\\n started life in ECS and is now a world-leading start-up incubator which nurtures aspiring\\n entrepreneurs and cutting-edge technologies through one-to-one support and a network of\\n seasoned founders, investors and millionaire entrepreneurs. Future Worlds has led to over 30\\n start-ups launching or raising investment totalling over £5.8m, including five involving CS staff\\n and/or PGR students (§4.2.3).\\n In addition, SETsquared’s Innovation to Commercialisation of University Research (ICURe)\\n programme, provides support for potential University start-ups and spinouts, and has helped\\n establish several successful routes to commercialisation, including Blupoint (§4.2.3).\\n Furthermore, the WSI has an initiative Zero-to-one (Z21), a £500K collaboration with the Solent\\n Local Enterprise Partnership. Z21 has provided £200K of minimum viable product and pre-seed\\n funding for seven start-ups (involving 12 ECS staff and students) since its inception in 2017.\\n These initiatives have led to £1.2M worth of Innovate UK projects over the REF period including\\n three Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs, §4.2).\\n                                                                                                Page 12\\n\\n\\n Enterprise activities are at the heart of the IT Innovation Centre (§1.1). A centre of excellence in\\n applied research and knowledge exchange, it takes fundamental research through higher\\n technology readiness levels towards the development of ideas for commercial exploitation. IT\\n Innovation also leads the ECS industrial strategy working with other ECS groups and centres to\\n establish industry and public sector propositions, and a culture of collaboration for effecting\\n partnerships. IT Innovation leads the regional initiative Coalition for Innovation and Digital Health\\n Research (CIDHR) across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight to build research and innovation\\n pipelines into health and care systems, working with University Hospitals Southampton NHS\\n Foundation Trust Public Health and the NHS Scientist Training Programme.\\n Impact is further facilitated through the three centres, which provide a primary point of contact for\\n industry and government collaborations, and the organisation of the aforementioned events.\\n Policy impact is facilitated through the University’s public policy unit (REF5a§2.9), which\\n connects researchers to policymakers and provides a range of services around impact including\\n training, secondments, and policy consultations (§4.2.1). §4.2 provides impact highlights\\n achieved over the REF period.\\n 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society\\n 4.1 Research collaborations\\n CS has a strong track record in building collaborations with other institutions and with industry.\\n Arrangements in place to support this at University level include RIS (REF5a§1.5). In addition,\\n as member of the ATI, we have dedicated staff in ECS to encourage participation. At the census\\n date we had five ATI pilot projects led by CS staff, seven CS ATI fellows (§4.4.1), and another\\n seven where CS staff are co-investigators. Almost all grants have an interdisciplinary component\\n or are joined with other institutions including industry. In particular, the recently awarded TAS\\n Hub facilitates engagement with over 60 partners in areas ranging from computing and robotics\\n to social sciences and the humanities. ECS supports industrial partnership within the WSI-\\n fostered Centre on AI for the Future Society within the Web Science Institute (WSI) and,\\n previously, within the Web Science CDT.\\n ECS also has extensive collaborations, strategic partnerships, secondments and knowledge\\n exchange activities with industry, NGOs, and government organisations. Examples include:\\n    •   Collaboration with researchers in Turkey, the UN (ILO) and industry on the use of sensor\\n        fusion and stream reasoning algorithms for real-time health and safety regulation\\n        monitoring in workplaces (incl. mining operations).

Jennings, Pro-VC research at Imperial, as Visiting Professor in AIC, contributed\\n        to PhD supervision and collaborated on several projects including DAIS-ITA. Stanford-\\n        Clark, CTO IBM UK is a Visiting Professor in AIC. Meers, Fellow at DSTL and Head of AI\\n        Labs at DSTL, is an Adjunct Professor in ECS, RAEng Visiting Professor and sits on the\\n        industrial advisory board, contributing to the TAS Hub. Wilby from Thales is Adjunct\\n        Professor in ECS and advises on several ongoing research projects.\\n                                                                                                Page 13\\n\\n\\n    •   The Arm-ECS partnership celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2018. This Industry-University\\n        collaborative initiative focuses on advanced hardware and software co-design, has been\\n        cited as an exemplar for such partnerships by the EPSRC, and was invited to contribute to\\n        the Dowling Review of Business-University Research Collaborations. It was awarded\\n        ‘University Research Group of the Year’ in 2015 by the UK technology industry body,\\n        TechWorks.\\n    •   NHS: IT Innovation is one of six University groups to secure the NHS Digital Security\\n        Toolkit accreditation allowing research teams to process NHS data within a secure and\\n        ethical environment. The activity has led to significant local, regional, national and\\n        international collaborations. Partnerships with NHS organisations (e.g. University Hospital\\n        Southampton (UHS) and Wessex NHS Trusts) and local authorities (Southampton City\\n        Council (SCC)) have been established in response to COVID and wider challenges of\\n        digital health. ECS is now digital lead within the recently established Wessex Academic\\n        Health Sciences Centre and has formed the Social Data Foundation\\n        (www.socialdatafoundation.org) as a partnership between University, UHS and SCC\\n        tackling challenges of health and social care transformation.\\n    •   Shell is funding the Centre for Maritime Futures (CMF) through a £1.5M gift donation.\\n    •   Roke Manor sponsored Sassone’s Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) Chair and is\\n        a key partner in MINDS CDT.\\n    •   GCHQ sponsors the Cyber Security Academy, a GCHQ centre of excellence hosted by\\n        ECS and funds several projects.\\n 4.2 Contributions to economy and society\\n 4.2.1 Policy impact\\n ECS has extensive impact on policy through high profile academics such as Hall, Sassone and\\n Jennings. In addition, policy impact is facilitated through the University’s public policy unit,\\n which connects researchers to policymakers and provides a range of services around impact\\n including training, secondments, and policy consultations.\\n Notable examples include:\\n      •   Hall is member of the UK Government AI Council and is their AI Skills Champion. She\\n          co-authored the influential AI review entitled “Growing the AI Industry in the UK”,\\n          commissioned by DCMS and BEIS, and has shaped the government’s AI agenda.\\n          https://bit.ly/2qExHdU. This led to the establishment of the Office for AI. Hall is a member\\n          of the World Economic Forum’s Global Futures Council on the Digital Economy, and\\n          participated in several UK government roles: UK Government AI Sector deal (2018);\\n          Final report of the Global Commission on Internet Governance: One Internet (2016);\\n          RUSI report \"A Democratic Licence to Operate: Report of the Independent Surveillance\\n          Review\" (2015).\\n      •   Jennings was HM Government Chief Scientific Advisor for National Security to the UK\\n          government (2010-2015).\\n      •   Simperl was invited to co-author a White Paper on engagement models for data trusts,\\n          presented to the Office for AI, the Government Office for Science and the Department for\\n          the Environment and Rural Affairs.\\n      •   Sassone is member of the Strategic Cyber Governance Group of the South East\\n          Regional Organised Crime Unit of the Police; Chief Scientific Officer for project Noi-PA of\\n          Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy).\\n      •   O’Hara’s work has impacted policies around data governance. His anonymisation work\\n          led to the Anonymisation Decision-making Framework, published in 2016 by the UK\\n          Anonymisation Network (UKAN) and adapted for Australian law in 2017 with CSIRO and\\n                                                                                                 Page 14\\n\\n\\n          for GDPR in 2020. Since 2019, Hall and O’Hara have worked with the Royal Society and\\n          the Law Society of London to produce standards for data trusts.\\n     •    Snow (PDRA, AIC group, 2015-2019) was seconded to DEFRA (July-October 2018),\\n          and authored a report on behaviour change interventions focussed on indoor air quality.\\n     •    Tiropanis contributed to the EIT Digital report on \"European Digital Infrastructure and\\n          Data Sovereignty - A Policy Perspective\" (June 2020).\\n     •    Middleton was AI expert to UK Cabinet Office on “use of AI in policing” (2019).\\n     •    schraefel was a member of the of the World Economic Forum (WEF)’s data policy\\n          working group in 2019-2020 and was invited to work with Facebook on their privacy-by-\\n          design approach which contributed to the WEF’s report on “Redesigning Data Privacy:\\n          Reimagining Notice & Consent for human technology interaction” (July 2020).\\n Policy impact was also achieved by our enterprise-focused institutes (§1.1), e.g.:\\n     •    SSI has significant influence on policy with regards to recognising software as an\\n          important part of research, leading to 28 Research Software Engineer groups across the\\n          UK, and the development of the e-infrastructure section of the 10-year UKRI roadmap.\\n     •    Pickering (IT Innovation) co-chaired the Global Research Data Alliance Legal and Ethics\\n          working group producing guidance for researchers and policy makers during COVID-19.\\n     •    Boniface (IT Innovation) led an interdisciplinary team to forecast the impact of COVID-19\\n          on hospitals providing insight to UHS and regional decision-makers.\\n 4.2.2 Broader contributions to the economy and society\\n In addition to the impact described in §1.4 and §3.4, highlights include:\\n Health and wellbeing: In 2016 schraefel set up the wellthlab (https://www.wellthlab.ac.uk/) with\\n the vision to “make normal better for all at scale”. The lab’s mission is to develop, research,\\n innovate, and question how interactive technologies and services can improve health and well-\\n being. This has led to a series of international workshops on the “inbodied interaction” approach\\n to computational interactive technology which schraefel has developed and has been featured\\n in a special issue of IX magazine, the leading forum of the ACM for human computer interaction.\\n This work has also been shared in an international summer school sponsored by the ACM and\\n hosted at the UoS with participants from ten countries. This methodology is being adopted in the\\n human-computer interaction undergraduate and post graduate curriculum in the UK and abroad,\\n as schraefel has been helping groups including Cardiff, Edinburgh, Bath, Lancaster, Sheffield,\\n Swansea, Brigham Young, UCSD, LSM and others to incorporate the approach into their regular\\n HCI teaching. schraefel is also the University’s Health and Wellbeing Champion and co-founder\\n of the LivingLab for leading wellbeing as lived research on the University campus.\\n Accessible technology: Research by Wald et al on technologies to address gaps in media\\n accessibility is reflected on the LexDis website (https://www.lexdis.org.uk) that provides\\n strategies and support to approximately 10,000 users annually. Because of its recognised\\n impact, LexDis was chosen in 2019 to host the national guidance information for the new UK\\n accessibility regulations. This work also led to the creation of free and open training materials on\\n digital accessibility and inclusive teaching and learning environments that have been used within\\n a series of Massive Open Online Courses (2016-2018) with over 20,000 registrants.\\n Furthermore, through an Innovate UK Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) project\\n (investigators: Wills, Wald) with Microlink PLC, technologies for automated accessibility\\n assessments were produced leading to a turnover and profit increase for the partnering\\n company; this had a further impact in the companies employing disabled people, and to the UK\\n economy by reducing the cost of benefits and increasing tax revenue.\\n Disaster response: In the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in Nepal in 2015, algorithms\\n developed by Ramchurn et al as part of the ORCHID project enabled the processing of large\\n volumes of satellite and aerial imagery, and identified likely impacted locations not yet visited by\\n                                                                                               Page 15\\n\\n\\n emergency response workers. This benefitted rescue work by Rescue Global who were partners\\n on the project.\\n Smart environmental monitoring: In 2018, a team from ECS included Rogers and two CS\\n PhD students (Hill and Prince) who designed and developed AudioMoth\\n (https://www.openacousticdevices.info), acoustic technology for identifying species and\\n gunshots based on machine learning techniques. This technology has been deployed for the\\n purpose of conservation in 687 projects across six continents and enabled the identification of\\n three new orthoptera species in Brazil, and conservation projects by the Bat Conservation Trust\\n in the UK, as well as the Belize Forest Department in its 25km2 Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve.\\n Hill later applied similar technology at the London Zoo where he completed a secondment.\\n Apart from the KTP on accessible technologies (see above) impact is achieved through two\\n additional KTPs: With The ai Corporation (investigator: Niranjan) fundamental research on\\n outlier detection in the area of bioinformatics is applied to a credit card fraud detection system of\\n the partnering company. ExecView (investigator: Wills) is embedding the latest research in\\n business psychology and gamification in its software for project and programme management\\n support.\\n 4.2.3 Spin-outs\\n The ECS enterprise strategy has resulted in several novel spin-outs during the REF period:\\n ArchAI (https://www.archai.io/) was founded by CS PhD student Iris Kramer. Using deep-\\n learning AI for archaeological surveys to reduce the need for manual field assessment, ArchAI\\n received £70K investment from Future Worlds dragons (https://futureworlds.com/ai-\\n archaeologist-tops-triple-investment-success-in-future-worlds-dragons-den/) and was valued at\\n £770k in November 2020. This led to further funding and an RAEng Enterprise Fellowship\\n (outside of the REF period) for its CEO, Iris.\\n AuraVision (https://futureworlds.com/discover-aura-vision-labs/) was founded in 2017 by former\\n CS PhD students with the help of Future Worlds and Z21 funding and resulted from the student’s\\n PhD work.\\n Blu.Network (formerly BluPoint; Co-founder: Wills) delivers educational materials and health\\n information to people in remote areas using solar-powered content servers. The spin-out was\\n formed in 2015 winning an ICURe programme award and received £500K funding from Innovate\\n UK. The company attracted new investors and, as Blu.Network, is deploying pilots in many\\n diverse locations including Dixons Carphone in South Africa.\\n Empati Ltd. (Director: Ramchurn), incorporated in July 2019, is building on research for energy-\\n saving, agent-based algorithms.

As a result of her work, Pau (F) has won\\n WiSET and UoS Dean’s Awards for championing women in STEM. In addition, about 75% of\\n staff at all levels participate in outreach activities. During the REF period we have engaged with\\n over 39,000 young people aged 11-17, and participated in 280 talks and events including: an\\n annual summer taster course, annual Science and Engineering Day, taster days, school\\n assemblies, school lessons, after-school club sessions, teacher breakfast sessions and careers\\n fairs. We also engage with local events such as Pint of Science and the British Science Festival,\\n and major events including the Farnborough Airshow and the BBC Countryfile Show through the\\n University’s PERu. In her role as the MINDS CDT Outreach and EDI Champion, Pau has\\n established an Outreach Ambassadors programme, providing enhanced training for research\\n students in outreach leadership. As this develops, we plan to use this as the basis for a\\n programme across ECS, extending it to research staff.\\n An important part of our outreach strategy is to tackle gender imbalance and increase female\\n participation in STEM. Since 2017, we have created four ‘A-level Physics Kits’ demonstrating CS\\n principles. These were piloted with female students and each year we send 250 sets to local\\n schools and train teachers to use them. Also, since 2014, ECS has hosted the annual\\n Smallpeice residential summer school on topics including CS and robotics, with 50 students from\\n 40 schools around the UK (averaging 38%F) and led by a female ECS academic. ECS also\\n annually hosts a range of school visits within its teaching laboratories, and our policy is to ask\\n schools to bring a 50:50 gender group. We also have ‘Women in Tech’ days with 10-50 female\\n students.\\n schraefel initiated and leads the national seminar series with international experts on how to\\n improve engagement of women as undergrads in CS (https://cphc.ac.uk/cphc-seminar-series-\\n the-women-into-computer-science-experience/), which has over 800 members.

      "['University of York\\n Unit of assessment: 11 - Computer Science and Informatics\\n 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n Context and Structure\\n This submission comprises staff from the Department of Computer Science at York (hereafter\\n referred to as CS). CS research is a central part of the University’s vision and strategy.\\n Departmental research is organised under four themes which are detailed below, reflecting the\\n research strengths of CS. As well as making major contributions to core research, CS also\\n contributes to a whole spectrum of research across the University through six interdisciplinary\\n research centres where CS researchers collaborate on a day-to-day basis with other\\n departments. We submitted all category A eligible staff and indicators in this report are based on\\n this group where relevant.\\n The strength and breadth of this research and its importance to the University’s vision helped\\n inform the York Research Strategy (2015-2020) which created seven key research themes\\n across the University (Institutional Level Environment Statement (IES), paragraph 4, 11). Our\\n research makes significant contributions to the themes of (1) Creativity, (2) Health and\\n Wellbeing, (3) Risk, Evidence and Decision Making, and (4) Technologies for the Future.\\n Professor McDermid led the Risk, Evidence and Decision Making theme from 2015 to 2017.\\n    Theme                      Research Focus\\n                               Research in this area explores the specification, design and\\n                               verification of high-integrity and safety-critical systems. Topics\\n                               include:\\n                               • Real-Time Behaviour (can a system be proven to always\\n                                    meet its timing requirements?)\\n    Critical Systems           • Cyber Security (can an autonomous system protect itself\\n                                    from malicious attacks?)\\n                               • Model-Driven Engineering (can the integrity of a system be\\n                                    improved by exploiting high-level system models?)\\n                               • High Integrity Systems Engineering (how can critical systems\\n                                    be cost-effectively verified and assured?)\\n                               This research theme aims to deliver robust, inclusive, and\\n                               human-centred computing technology for a diverse range of end\\n    People, Health and         users. Topics include:\\n    Wellbeing                  • Safety and reliability in medical applications\\n                               • Gaming and wellbeing\\n                               • Accessibility of digital technologies\\n                               Research in this area explores the study of data, methods for\\n                               analysing data in different domains, and artificial intelligence\\n                               techniques for improving our methods of working with large and\\n                               heterogeneous data. This encompasses novel research on\\n    Analytics                  artificial intelligence, computer games, e-Sports, natural\\n                               language processing and machine learning. Topics include:\\n                               • Safe decision making in autonomous agents\\n                               • Big data architectures\\n                               • Bayesian methods and graphical models\\n\\n\\n                               •   Natural language processing\\n                               •   Optimisation and constraint satisfaction\\n                               Research within this theme looks at building a generation of\\n                               computer vision systems with capabilities that exceed those of\\n                               human vision, including new algorithms and hardware. This\\n                               involves studying the techniques and tools for computer vision,\\n                               image processing and analysis, and pattern recognition. Topics\\n    Beyond Human Vision include:\\n                               • Model-informed visual learning\\n                               • Novel vision systems\\n                               • 3D modelling\\n                               • Computer graphics and image generation\\n The move away from a research group-based organisation to these broader research themes is\\n part of an overall Departmental and University-wide strategy to promote multi/trans-disciplinary\\n research, which we believe is necessary to enable large societal challenges to be addressed.\\n Each theme has a Theme Champion who is responsible for fostering the research ethos of the\\n theme and encouraging collaboration between themes and beyond CS. The themes are\\n purposefully interdisciplinary and chosen to represent research strengths within the Department,\\n and to integrate with the University research themes and strategy. These themes are broader\\n than our previous research groups to facilitate easier and wider collaboration across multiple\\n areas of research within the Department - most researchers belong to more than one theme.\\n Above the themes, research activity is managed at a Departmental level by the Departmental\\n Research Committee (DRC) and the Deputy Head of Department (Research). The DRC meets\\n quarterly and consists of HoD, DHoD(R), REF Lead and representatives of the research staff,\\n ECRs and PGRs.\\n Interdisciplinary Centres\\n CS additionally supports interdisciplinary research across subject boundaries through six\\n research centres which are home to research and researchers from multiple departments:\\n The York Cross-Disciplinary Centre for Systems Analysis (YCCSA) brings together\\n researchers from different departments to develop novel mathematical, computational and\\n analytical methods, and tools for the analysis and modelling of complex systems. YCCSA\\n members are from the Departments of Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Biology,\\n Chemistry, Electronic Engineering, Management, History of Art and Environment. This diverse\\n team of researchers works across all seven University research themes.\\n Digital Creativity Labs (DCLabs) is a centre of excellence for impact driven research in games,\\n interactive media and the rich space where they converge (IES paragraph 11). It is led by York\\n and involves Goldsmiths, the University of Falmouth, and around 100 industrial partners. It is\\n supported by a substantial investment of £18m by EPSRC. DCLabs is strongly involved in the\\n Creativity theme.\\n The Quantum Communications Hub (QCHub) is a collaboration between Physics and CS and\\n is funded as part of the UK National Quantum Technologies Programme with substantial funding\\n of £24m over five years (IES paragraph 11). It focusses on delivering quantum secure\\n communications by drawing on research from Physics and Computer Science. QCHub works\\n within the Technologies for the Future theme.\\n The Assuring Autonomy International Programme (AAIP) is a £12m initiative funded by\\n Lloyd’s Register Foundation and the University of York to lead research, training and standards\\n in the safety of robotics and autonomous systems (RAS) (IES paragraph 11). This work is led by\\n\\n\\n CS academics and researchers and is focussed on both foundational research and technology\\n transfer to industry and regulators. The AAIP works extensively with industry and regulators,\\n through what are referred to as ‘demonstrator projects’ supporting the assurance of emerging\\n systems and technologies in a range of industries including autonomous driving, healthcare and\\n manufacturing. AAIP contributes significantly to the Risk, Evidence and Decision Making theme.\\n The York Interdisciplinary Centre for Cyber Security brings together expertise across the\\n University of York and internationally to address current and potential cyber security challenges.\\n Areas include IoT, blockchain, cryptographic protocols, quantum and post-quantum\\n cryptography, homomorphic machine learning, cyber security in politics and law, mathematics\\n behind cyber security, and data analysis for encrypted medical data. The centre draws staff from\\n CS, Physics, Mathematics, Law and Management. This centre contributes to both the Risk,\\n Evidence and Decision Making and the Technologies for the Future themes.\\n YorRobots is an institution-wide initiative, led by CS, bringing together researchers and\\n practitioners with an interest in robotics and autonomous systems, and their applications. The\\n collaboration spans nine departments in the University. The aim of the centre is to maximise the\\n impact of robotics expertise at York to the benefit of UK industry. YorRobots is involved in\\n research into the development of advanced, ethical, safe, trusted, reliable, and certifiable mobile\\n and autonomous robots.\\n We are the only department to be involved in four of the University’s major centres and hubs\\n (IES paragraph 11).\\n Research Strategy\\n Our primary research strategy is to be a world leader in research, based on the foundations of\\n international excellence, innovation, impact, collaboration and integrity. Our strategic aims reflect\\n the University strategy (IES paragraph 9):\\n      •   Recruit and retain the best researchers at all career stages and offer them an attractive\\n          and supportive research environment.\\n      •   Encourage and support interdisciplinary research strengths, both interdepartmentally and\\n          internationally.\\n      •   Deploy Departmental resources to support and build research excellence.\\n      •   Recruit the very best postgraduate research students and support the excellent research\\n          work of our PGR students and supervisors.\\n Our previous strategic aims, articulated in REF 2014, were to create world-leading research\\n contributions in Games and Gaming; Inter-disciplinary Research and Advanced Architectures\\n and their Applications. This has been achieved through substantial new initiatives in the\\n Department and the reorganisation around themes.\\n We are a world leader in Games and Gaming through the DC Labs and the Intelligent Games &\\n Games Intelligence Doctoral Training Centre (IGGI), with a team of around 80 staff and students\\n delivering wide-ranging and impactful research in the area. These centres collaborate with\\n hundreds of companies, providing an immensely valuable route to real-world impact. We have\\n won substantial funding to support this area, including £18m from UKRI to support DCLabs, with\\n £10m from EPSRC and companies for IGGI from 2014-2020. IGGI was funded for a second\\n round in 2019, with a total funding commitment of £20m.\\n We have grown and supported a rich culture of inter-disciplinary research to fulfil our goals in\\n that area, through the six research centres listed above. We provide coordination and leadership\\n for four of these centres (YorRobots, YCCSA, Cybersecurity and AAIP) and again have been\\n awarded substantial funds to support these areas, including £12m from Lloyd’s Register\\n Foundation and the University of York. QCHub is part of a wider research programme in\\n quantum technologies, which includes the York Centre for Quantum Technologies (YCQT).\\n YCQT is a partnership between the departments of Physics, Mathematics, Electronic\\n Engineering and Computer Science comprising 19 academics from those departments.\\n\\n\\n     Finally, our goals in the area of Advanced Architectures and their Applications are being\\n   delivered through the Assuring Autonomy International Program, a RAEng Chair in Emerging\\n   Technologies, eight funded projects and 40 research staff and students. The Critical Systems\\n   theme demonstrates our research strength in this area, and we detail below the substantial\\n   number of appointments made in this area. One of the key focusses of the AAIP is in delivering\\n   significant industrial impact through demonstrator projects and other collaborations and through\\n   work on standards and industrial guidelines.\\n   We have undergone a restructuring of the Department’s research, moving from research groups\\n   to the theme structure described above, to encourage cross-area and silo-free working, and the\\n   six research centres to support inter-disciplinary research and impact. This strategy was\\n   formulated with significant input from all research staff, including two research ‘away days’ held\\n   outside the Department where staff had an opportunity to discuss and debate research\\n   structures. We have supported these themes through a proactive and very substantial early\\n   career academic hiring process and providing substantial support for these ECRs – at the REF\\n   census date, we have hired 18 permanent new academic staff since March 2017, including 11\\n   ECRs. The appointments are described in more detail in section 2, but we have made targeted\\n   appointments to the themes including eight to Critical Systems, and two each to Analytics,\\n   Beyond Human Vision and Health and Wellbeing.\\n   We have world-leading expertise in Critical Systems, including our work on safety, security,\\n   enterprise, robotics, autonomous, embedded, and real-time systems. Our vision is to capitalise\\n   on this over the next 5 years, by consolidating our new research themes, developing our\\n   interdisciplinary centres, and developing new areas of research where appropriate. This includes\\n   a plan to grow the academic research and teaching staff to 55 FTE over the next two years from\\n   44 FTE currently. Clearly these plans are dependent on the research environment going\\n   forward, which is currently uncertain. Our specific goals over the next 5 years are:\\n•  To build on our world-leading status in research in Critical Systems, Safety of Autonomy, Human\\n   Vision, Digital Creativity and Games, and Quantum Computing.\\n        • To develop our international reputation in Analytics and People, Health and Well-being.\\n        • To incubate new strengths, particularly in the areas of Software Engineering for\\n           Robotics, and Cybersecurity, and support new interdisciplinary efforts in Robotics and\\n           Cybersecurity across the institution.\\n        • To establish a synergistic programme across robotics, communications, assurance and\\n           verification through the new Institute for Safe Autonomy.\\n        • To carry out cross-disciplinary research both across our research strengths, and\\n           throughout the sector as a whole, to maximise impact and particularly impact for the\\n           public good.\\n        • To provide the best guidance and research environment for PhD students, including the\\n           establishment of a cohort based Graduate School within the Department.\\n   Impact Strategy\\n   Impact is fundamental to the University and Department strategy at all levels. The Department\\n   has an Impact Champion who co-ordinates and oversees impact activity across CS. This\\n   enables us to develop a coherent impact strategy across the Department. We also work closely\\n   with, and benefit from, the University impact manager and the science faculty impact manager\\n   (IES paragraph 12). We also have an Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) which includes nine\\n   industry practitioners. The IAB is an invaluable channel between Industry and the Department\\n   and gives advice on impact, research areas and current industry trends and initiatives. Current\\n   IAB membership includes representatives from major companies such as IBM, BAe, and\\n   Morgan Stanley.\\n   Our strategy is to generate impact through industry engagement with our research centres. The\\n   centres have considerable industry involvement and are in some cases sponsored by industry\\n   partners (DCLabs and AAIP), and so they are an ideal route to impact. Our aim is to disseminate\\n   the research generated within the themes and centres to these partners and the wider public\\n\\n\\n and then exploit the opportunities this creates to apply the research in practical scenarios. As an\\n example, we have a large body of research and expertise in the safe design of critical software\\n systems and, as part of this work, we have been involved in setting key international standards\\n in high-integrity systems. For many years we have held continuing professional development\\n (CPD) courses to disseminate this knowledge to software engineers and embed these standards\\n and methods in industrial design. As a result, this work has had major impact on the practice of\\n safety critical systems engineering (see ICS) and was instrumental in the founding of AAIP,\\n which we expect to continue to produce major impact in the future. DCLabs was founded as part\\n of a key initiative to bring together creative industries and new technologies. The WEAVR\\n project, for example, is a £5.8m project running under the umbrella of DCLabs. It aims to\\n develop data-driven content production for e-sports and is the underpinning work which\\n generated an impact case study (see ICS). This is a direct result of this collaboration between\\n computer scientists and the games industry.\\n As part of our strategy, we have shifted our focus towards projects more directly aimed at impact\\n and knowledge transfer, particularly through Innovate UK and KTP funded projects. These\\n projects give a direct route to impact for our research and are already producing results. KTPs\\n with Rolls Royce, IBM and BAe are tied to our assurance and high-integrity systems work and\\n related to an impact case study (see ICS). A KTP with Gaist developed new strategies for\\n scheduling road pothole maintenance which has been deployed by several councils and was\\n developed into a full impact case study, although it was not selected for the REF. A further Gaist\\n KTP developed a method for the seamless presentation of very large road survey data which\\n has been deployed into a commercial product. A KTP with Balfour Beatty aimed to improve the\\n identification of railway line faults using computer vision and the methods are also now in\\n commercial products.\\n More generally, the research themes at both the Department and University levels have public\\n benefit at their heart and are designed to ensure our research has national and international\\n visibility. The public interest and potential impact of these themes is evident, and one of the\\n impact case studies is a result of work at the interface between critical systems research and\\n industry (see ICS). We have worked hard to ensure that our themes do not consist of isolated\\n pockets of research, but instead have clear public interest and routes to engagement and\\n impact. One of our impact case studies is the result of making our research open source for the\\n whole community to use, as part of the Eclipse software development project (see ICS).\\n Open Research\\n The Department also encourages open access for research outputs in order to generate\\n maximum impact, including papers, code and datasets. The Institutional Environment Statement\\n details the policy for deposit and public availability of research outputs which goes beyond the\\n REF requirements (IES paragraphs 15-17). There has been a cultural shift towards a more open\\n publishing culture within CS, with some outputs being made available on a pre-print archive\\n such as arXiv before submission. The vast majority of CS outputs are published in green open-\\n access venues and are freely available after the embargo period from the White Rose\\n repository. We also encourage the open release of software, and this has led to contributions to\\n the Eclipse Foundation (Epsilon, Emfatic, Hawk, and the foundation of one of the impact case\\n studies), GOBNILP Bayesian network learning software, RoboTool for modelling robotic\\n systems, DOMtegrity (protecting website integrity) and secure anonymous voting software. We\\n have released a number of datasets for general use by the public including machine learning\\n datasets (PRoNTo point cloud shape retrieval, RNA graph dataset) and a family of human head\\n shape models (Headspace, The Liverpool-York Head Model and the York Ear Model).\\n Research Integrity\\n The University and Department fully appreciate the importance of research integrity and ethical\\n standards. The University maintains a number of policies on research integrity and ethics\\n (Codes of Practice on Research Integrity, Good Ethical Governance and a policy for the\\n Investigation of an Allegation of Research Misconduct, IES paragraph 14). These policies are\\n implemented at the Departmental level by two designated ethics coordinators who oversee this\\n\\n\\n process and deal with any ethical or research integrity queries. A faculty-level Physical Sciences\\n Ethics Committee is responsible for the ethical approval of research where required. The\\n Department also has some supplementary policies covering issues more relevant to CS,\\n including a CS ethics approval guide for all research project submissions. All research grant\\n applications must make an ethical statement and put in place appropriate data handling\\n arrangements under a data management plan. The research PI has primary responsibility for the\\n integrity and ethical standards of a research project, but ethical approval must be sought where\\n necessary from the subject-level ethics committee.\\n 2. People\\n Staffing Strategy\\n Over this REF period, we have had the opportunity to refresh our academic staff and to\\n strengthen key areas in our new research theme structure. We have focussed particularly on\\n promising young researchers and during the REF period we have appointed 18 junior\\n researchers. We have also targeted senior appointments in national priority areas\\n (Cybersecurity and Digital Economy) with two new Professors since October 2017. Our goal is\\n to strengthen the demographics of the Department for the long term. We have appointed 8 new\\n academics to the Critical Systems theme (Chang, Wright, Matragkas, Gray, Gerasimou,\\n Camera, Liu, Yadav), and others to Beyond Human Vision (Huber, Guarnera), Analytics\\n (Nightingale, Drachen) and Health and Wellbeing (Iacovides, Zendle). We have also appointed a\\n new group of researchers in Cybersecurity (Kahrobaei, Fashim, Shahandashti, Vasilakis). As we\\n noted in the previous REF submission, the appointments are partly driven by a staff profile\\n means that a number of senior researchers have left the Department. We have therefore\\n targeted senior posts where necessary to support the research themes in the Department and to\\n this end have appointed new Chairs of Cybersecurity (Kahrobaei) and Digital Games (Drachen),\\n and internally promoted staff to Chairs in Quantum Computing (Pirandola), Software\\n Engineering (Kolovos) and HCI (Cairns). All except two category A staff submitted are on\\n permanent contracts. These academics are both research fellows appointed to specific funded\\n posts. The mixture of appointments over the REF period puts us in a position where we have a\\n healthy and sustainable mix of staff at all career stages going forward.\\n The Department aims to support a rich and diverse research culture, and staff mobility forms a\\n key part of this strategy. We have a number of incoming and outgoing international visiting\\n fellows. We have hosted research visits from Italy, Spain, Germany, Portugal, Canada and\\n Brazil. Our staff have held visiting positions at Beihang University, Inria Paris, Universidade\\n Federal de Pernambuco Brazil and Western University Canada. These visiting staff are funded\\n by a range of sources, including research grants, University pump-priming funds and host\\n organisations. We encourage staff to apply for fellowships as a critical part of their development\\n as exceptional researchers at all career stages. This is not limited to research fellowships; we\\n also encourage staff to apply for knowledge-exchange positions. During the REF period,\\n Cavalcanti, Hancock and Cowling have held Wolfson Research Merit Awards, and Habli and\\n Power have held RAEng Industrial Fellowships. Smith was awarded a RAEng/Leverhulme Trust\\n Senior Research Fellowship. Cavalcanti also holds a 10-year RAEng Chair in Emerging\\n Technologies. We have also hosted a UKRI Innovation Fellowship (Foster) and a Royal\\n Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 Fellowship (Giscard).\\n Staff Support and Development\\n The University maintains a statement on Research Performance Expectations which outlines our\\n commitment to staff support and working environment as well as the expectations we have of\\n research staff (IES paragraph 22). The Department maintains its own statement on expectations\\n which complements the University-level one with more CS-specific details.\\n The Department understands the need to support staff development at all career stages. All\\n academic staff undergo an annual personal development review with a senior member of the\\n Department where they can discuss career progress, any problems arising and identify training\\n needs. Other researchers are reviewed by their project leads or line managers. The University\\n\\n\\n offers a comprehensive skills training programme to support staff development which is detailed\\n in the institutional environment statement (IES paragraph 32). Staff are invited to apply to an\\n annual promotion round. The Deputy Heads (Teaching and Research) offer early-stage support\\n and advice to help staff construct their promotion applications and present the best case to the\\n University.\\n The Department has launched a new intensive programme of mentoring which is available to all\\n staff. Staff can request one or two mentors to help them achieve objectives related to research\\n (writing a grant proposal, developing a research paper for a leading journal for example) and to\\n teaching. A personal program of mentoring is designed for each member of staff to help them\\n most effectively achieve their goals (e.g., through frequent intensive meetings over a short\\n period of time, through to less frequent meetings over longer periods). Since CS has appointed\\n a significant number of ECRs in the period, we have instituted a new ECR network within CS to\\n offer particular support to ECRs. This involves monthly lunch meetings with invited guest\\n speakers to discuss key topics relevant to this group of researchers, and more informal\\n meetings. Seminars have included discussions of funding opportunities, REF and University\\n research data systems. We have also recently been involved in extending this initiative to a\\n University-wide ECR community.\\n Study leave forms a major investment by the Department in staff and research development. All\\n academic staff are eligible to apply for study leave which can vary from a single term to a year\\n (e.g. for staff exiting major administrative posts). 15 staff took study leave in the REF period.\\n Examples include Cavalcanti, whose study leave at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco\\n (Brazil) lead to successful grant applications and a Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in\\n Emerging Technologies from research into verification of robotic simulations. Smith visited the\\n UCSD Center for Visual Computing in 2016, leading to two spotlight presentations at leading\\n vision conferences ECCV and ICCV. Pirandola visited MIT to carry out work on quantum\\n communications. Kolovos visited Rolls-Royce, leading to a Knowledge Transfer Partnership, and\\n OTE (Deutsche Telecom Group), leading to further collaboration in an EC Horizon 2020 project\\n on polyglot persistence architectures for big-data analytics.\\n We support all staff in the development of research impact through an impact champion in the\\n CS department and a faculty-level impact manager. The impact champion is responsible for\\n disseminating impact opportunities to researchers, supporting CS researchers in the\\n development of impact and promoting awareness of the value of impact. The faculty impact\\n manager is available to give advice on impact in research projects at all stages from proposal\\n development to the post-project phases. We expect researchers to consider impact throughout\\n the development of a project, from conception to publicising the final outcomes.\\n To maintain strong links with industry, we have a number of visiting professors in the\\n Department. Whittington (MooD International) and Morgan (ETAS Ltd) are RAEng-sponsored\\n Visiting Professors. Many of our industry links are directly through research projects and\\n centres. Our funding strategy has in part been to encourage more direct links through\\n InnovateUK and industry funded projects. The AAIP programme is directly funded by Lloyds\\n Register Foundation and we have substantial research portfolios with BAe Systems (£233k),\\n Rolls Royce (£155k) and IBM (£157k). IBM also had a team physically located in the\\n Department for part of the REF period to enhance interactions with academics. Staff have been\\n actively encouraged to engage in knowledge transfer activities and have succeeded in\\n undertaking 25 projects funded by InnovateUK (£1.9m), including 8 Knowledge Transfer\\n Projects.\\n The University is fully engaged with The Concordat to Support the Career Development of\\n Researchers and has held the European Commission’s HR Excellence in Research Award since\\n 2010. There is an action plan for 2018-2020 to support implementation (IES paragraphs 27 and\\n 28) with some actions to be implemented at the Departmental level. There is a robust set of\\n procedures and policies to be followed at the Departmental level for the recruitment and\\n selection of researchers (Principle 1). All research staff are treated as full members of staff, and\\n so have the same access to mentoring, skills training and performance review (Principles 3 & 4).\\n\\n\\n This demonstrates that we recognise the importance of researchers to our research environment\\n (Principle 2). Researchers are made aware of their responsibilities and opportunities by their line\\n manager (usually the PI) when they are appointed (Principle 5). Diversity and Equality issues\\n (Principle 6) are addressed through our initiatives which apply to all staff and are described in\\n the next section. The University undertakes regular review of progress in this regard at all levels\\n (Principle 7). The Department is committed to trying to retain staff on fixed-term contracts where\\n possible and has provided resources to bridge researchers between research contracts where\\n appropriate.\\n Support for Equality and Diversity\\n The University has a comprehensive set of policies to support equality and diversity (IES\\n paragraphs 35-37), which are all implemented by the Department. We have appointed an\\n Equality Champion and initiated an Equality Committee which meets monthly. A set of\\n webpages has been created detailing our support for equality and diversity, and our “zero\\n tolerance” policy for any discrimination by staff or students has been widely publicised. The\\n Department supports flexible working for staff; full-time staff may choose flexible working hours\\n outside our two core time periods. We have policies for parental leave and staff may ask for\\n flexitime arrangements to support their personal circumstances. We also consider requests for\\n special arrangements when constructing the Department timetable annually. The University has\\n an on-site nursery to help support staff with young children. We reviewed our recruitment\\n materials and websites to ensure they give a positive and welcoming impression to all groups.\\n Over the past four years, the Department has undergone a thorough review of our activities\\n surrounding equality and diversity under the guidance of an Athena Swan and Equality\\n Champion (Petrie). We developed a new Athena Swan submission and, as part of that process,\\n we considered broader diversity issues beyond gender. The result of this work was the formation\\n of the Athena Swan Self-Assessment Team (SAT) and a comprehensive action plan for\\n improving equality and diversity. Many of the points on the Action Plan will not only support\\n women in the department, but also will greatly improve the study and work environment for\\n everyone. We believe this will also make it easier to expand our support to other under-\\n represented groups, including staff and students with disabilities and from different backgrounds.\\n The action plan consists of 10 high-level objectives and 60 detailed actions which will be\\n monitored and implemented by the Department over the next few years. These include a new\\n ‘best practice’ (from Informatics Europe) recruitment process to encourage female applicants for\\n all teaching and research positions. The SAT is engaged in all aspects of the recruitment\\n process, from review and revision of advertisements focusing on E&D issues, to monitoring\\n shortlisting and interviewing, to post-mortems on recruitment efforts (e.g., hiring panels) for\\n effectiveness assessment and future enhancement. We plan to improve the working\\n environment and to this end we have set up a network of women academics and researchers\\n who meet once a month for lunch to discuss issues in a more informal setting. We also aim to\\n improve the support for staff development through briefing and mentoring on topics including\\n promotion, preparation for REF and training. Many more such initiatives are included in the\\n action plan.\\n The selection of outputs for submission to REF2021 was made within the framework of the\\n University’s REF Code of Practice, which has robust procedures for ensuring transparency,\\n consistency, accountability, and inclusivity. A REF strategy group monitors the selection process\\n for any signs of bias. All Category A eligible staff are included in our submission and decisions\\n about research independence were made at University level, informed by an equality impact\\n assessment (EIA). The EIA was considered carefully at Departmental and University level.\\n Output selection was based on the primary criterion of quality, informed by at least two expert\\n reviewers and with recommendations from a CS REF committee. Within the constraints of this\\n criterion, we aimed to distribute outputs as widely as possible among staff. All staff were given\\n feedback on their selected papers and opportunity to comment. The composition of the CS\\n committee, recommendations and rationale behind the selection were reported to the University\\n to ensure transparency and accountability of decisions. Our analysis of the selected papers\\n\\n\\n does not show any statistically significant difference in papers submitted per researcher or in\\n estimated paper quality, on the basis of either gender or ethnicity.\\n Research Students\\n Research students are a critical component of our research community and we have a large and\\n growing PGR cohort who produce outstanding research. We expect our research students to\\n carry out original and rigorous research and communicate results to the widest possible\\n audience. As evidence of the high quality of our students Dale (Stepney and Trefzer) won the\\n 2019 CPHC/BCS Distinguished Dissertation competition and Aziz (Wilson and Hancock) was a\\n runner-up in 2015. We aim to attract high quality students to apply to our PGR programmes and\\n to ensure that the Department effectively monitors and supports them while there are here. It is\\n important that PGRs feel they are part of the research team in the Department, and so they have\\n the status of full staff members. We have created an online space for PGRs including a PGR\\n Community Page and PGR newsletters.\\n We recruit students from an extremely varied set of backgrounds. We have PGR programmes\\n leading to MSc by research, MPhil and PhD, with most of our students studying for PhD\\n degrees. We offer full-time and part-time degrees and a distance-learning option. These courses\\n help us cater for students with a diverse set of circumstances and needs. The part-time\\n distance-learning degree has been particularly successful in widening access, allowing students\\n from non-traditional backgrounds to study for a PhD, for example mid-career professionals who\\n have to maintain a job while studying and those not able to travel regularly to the University. As\\n mentioned in the previous section, we have worked hard to ensure our recruitment material and\\n interview processes encourage and support applicants from all kinds of backgrounds. We are\\n developing a ‘buddy’ system for applicants to allow them to ask questions of our current PGR\\n students with a similar background, where possible. Students are funded through a variety of\\n mechanisms, including self-funding and external sponsorship, the IGGI CDT, University\\n scholarships and Departmental scholarships. The scholarships are awarded through a\\n competitive process which considers both merit and the needs of the student.\\n The PGR programme is managed by a separate Research Studies Committee under the\\n framework set out by the University (IES paragraphs 30-34). The RSC implements a detailed\\n timetable of checkpoints and assessments aimed at making sure every student achieves their\\n goals and gets the help they need. Each research student is allocated a Thesis Advisory Panel\\n (TAP) consisting of a supervisor, assessor and panel chair. The supervisor offers ongoing\\n support and typically meets the student every week, and at least every two weeks. The student\\n must complete a milestone every six months, which has the dual purposes of allowing the\\n assessor to check progress and allowing the student to develop research presentation skills. A\\n Progression Panel is held at the end of each year of study (or full-time equivalent for part-time\\n study) where a group of senior academics meets to consider the progress and progression of all\\n research students. The Progression Panel is carefully selected to have a range of backgrounds\\n and to ensure that members are fully aware of equality and diversity issues that may affect\\n candidates. Students are able to seek support from their supervisor, assessor or the Chair of\\n Research Studies as appropriate. The assessor holds a confidential review of supervision at\\n each milestone to identify any problems with supervision arrangements. Our goal is to enable\\n students to submit a thesis as close to the target date as possible and to maximise the number\\n of students that complete. All PGR students have access to desktop machines in the\\n Department, and we have recently created a dedicated PGR space where students can work\\n and meet to discuss their research. This is part of our long-term goal to move towards a cohort-\\n based graduate school where students can interact more frequently with each other.\\n All research students undergo an induction at the start of their course, including a series of talks\\n and an introductory booklet. The department has an active training program and a PGR student\\n training officer. The program focuses on careers and skills development and has a set of core\\n compulsory modules (Research Integrity, Becoming an Effective Researcher, Professional\\n Development Planning) along with a range of more than 50 skills development courses.\\n Students who plan to teach must also take ‘Introduction to Teaching and Learning’ delivered at\\n\\n\\n University level. The skills development courses include careers, legal and ethical issues,\\n research management, impact and communication. The training officer supports the doctoral\\n students in running the York Doctoral Symposium, an event that is organised by students for\\n students, and which is in its eighth year. It attracts around 70 attendees, including external\\n participants. The students also run a student-focused seminar series on topics of specific\\n interest, such as preparing for a PhD viva. For students on our CDT programme, there is\\n additional specific training. Many PGRs also support our teaching programme through\\n demonstrating.\\n 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n Research Funding\\n Total research income reported in REF4b was £26m, as compared to £19m in REF2014. Our\\n strategy at the previous REF was to reduce dependence on UK industrial and government\\n funding by targeting EU income. This strategy was successful; we reported £3.92m of European\\n Commission funding for REF 2014, and we have £7.7m in the current REF period. Wider events\\n have triggered a change in focus and towards the end of the current period we have shifted our\\n income generation away from EU sources and towards projects more directly aimed at impact\\n and knowledge transfer. We have substantially increased our Innovate UK income, for example,\\n to £2.9m in the REF period (income includes directly funded and KTP funded projects). This will\\n allow us to generate high-impact outcomes for our research. We have maintained our level of\\n research council funding over the period to support our ‘blue-sky’ research. Research council\\n funding and PGR students are our main drivers of high-quality research outputs. Our forward-\\n looking strategy is to continue to seek funding from UKRI, while engaging more with the Grand\\n Challenge Research Fund (GCRF) and the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, as these are\\n well aligned with our themes and University strategy. We also plan to seek larger, collaborative\\n projects involving more staff at York (in CS and across other departments), and other\\n institutions, and to continue to promote fellowships for our research staff.\\n We aim to support our research themes and centres with significant research funding. The\\n Digital Creativity Lab has £18m of funding from UKRI, University partners and industrial\\n collaborators (IES paragraph 11). DCLabs is critical to support and enhance our research in\\n Analytics. The Assuring Autonomy International Programme (AAIP) is tied to our work on critical\\n systems and is a £12m commitment by Lloyd’s Register Foundation and the University of York.\\n The work in Assuring Autonomy and Robotics is also being provided with a purpose-built facility\\n via an RPIF bid (£10m, discussed in the next section) and an additional £4m provided by the\\n University. The Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence (IGGI) CDT has been funded to a\\n value of £5.6m by EPSRC and in total attracted £10m in funding in the first instance. The Centre\\n won continued funding in 2019 for another eight years, with a grant of £8.2m from EPSRC, York\\n and QMUL matched funding of £2m each, and industrial commitments in kind of £7.6m. The\\n Quantum Communications Hub is a collaboration between CS and Physics at York (IES\\n paragraph 11) which is one of four hubs funded as part of UK National Quantum Technologies\\n Programme, with £120m being committed for the four hubs. As well as this hub, we are\\n coordinating an EU project on quantum readout techniques and technologies (QUARTET) and\\n are part of an EU flagship grant (CiViQ, €10m). We have also been awarded substantial grants\\n at the interface between software engineering and physical systems (INTO-CPS European\\n Commission £700k, RoboCalc EPSRC £1.8m, RoboTest (jointly with Sheffield) EPSRC £1.1m).\\n The area of real-time systems continues to attract significant funding with two substantial\\n EPSRC grants (£593k for multi-core research and £934k in cyber-physical systems).\\n One of the outputs of our research into critical systems is a set of standards and methodologies\\n for engineering safety critical systems see Autonomy ICS). One of our routes to impact for this\\n work is through a series of professional development courses on safety-critical systems\\n engineering, training engineers from industry to apply state-of-the-art methods. This activity\\n brings around an additional £800k pa to the Department.\\n\\n\\n Infrastructure and Facilities\\n We continue to support experimental facilities in CS in the form of laboratories hosted largely\\n within the CS building. These support empirical research in each of our four research themes\\n and are listed below. We have also won a £10m award from the Research Partnership\\n Investment Fund to provide a state-of-the-art building supporting research in Autonomous\\n Systems. This Institute for Safe Autonomy Building will host our research in assured\\n autonomous systems, verifiable robots and safety assurance, and is additionally funded by £4m\\n from the University.\\n The HCI Interaction and Home Labs comprise two usability laboratories, three domestic\\n environment labs (a kitchen, living room and dining room), and a control room with specialist\\n equipment for usability research, games research and research with disabled and older people.\\n Equipment includes a range of input devices, screen-readers, screen magnification programs,\\n discreet webcams, eye trackers and screen capture software to monitor activities.\\n The Real Time Systems Lab supports real-time hardware analysis and sensor networking\\n research. This lab has been updated with a range of FPGA boards (cost £20k) and 4 GPU\\n servers (£80k). The separate Crossrail Lab provides facilities for student teaching and individual\\n projects in embedded and real-time systems and has been provided with 170 FPGA boards\\n (£25k).\\n The Computer Vision Lab suite comprises a dark room and natural light laboratories. Equipment\\n includes a laser range scanner (Cyberware 3030PS) for acquisition of calibrated shape, texture\\n and reflectance data, and optical bench and light stage facilities for polarisation imaging,\\n spectro-radiometery and photometric surface analysis. The lab supports the work of the ‘Beyond\\n Human Vision’ theme. The labs were refurbished in 2019 using £30k of Department funds. The\\n lab has been used to collect data for 18 research outputs during the REF period.\\n York Robotics Laboratory (YRL) (shared with the Department of Electronic Engineering) is a\\n purpose-built facility for experiments in robotics, including autonomous systems. The lab is\\n equipped with state-of-the-art tracking systems, a teaching/research classroom area and a\\n technical workshop area. It provides safe, constrained space for empirical testing of theories in\\n robotic and autonomous system behaviours, e.g. swarms of airborne systems and underwater\\n systems. The lab supports work in the Analytics theme and the AAIP centre, and employs a full-\\n time technician, shared between CS and Electronic Engineering.\\n We aim to make the most of our research space to help generate impact from our work. DCLabs\\n is a group of around 30 researchers hosted in a separate facility in the Ron Cooke Hub, adjacent\\n to the Computer Science building. This facility enables researchers from multiple departments to\\n come together with industry partners in one space. The RC Hub contains offices, interactive\\n spaces, break-out zones and seminar rooms, and rents space to small companies and start-ups\\n as well as hosting CS academics. The dedicated institute mentioned above for Assured\\n Autonomy and Robotics will bring together researchers from multiple departments into a building\\n with state-of-the-art facilities. A key part of the building design is a shared collaboration space\\n which aims to enable interaction between academia, government and industry and enhance\\n research impact. The Campus-based Catalyst building and the Science Park are close to the\\n Department and host innovative companies as well as several spin-outs, who collaborate with\\n researchers in the Department.\\n Research Students are a critical part of our research landscape and we provide them with the\\n best possible facilities for carrying out their research. PGRs are treated as members of staff in\\n terms of access to facilities and resources. Each PGR has access to a desk and desktop\\n computer within the Department. We have recently invested in a bespoke PGR space which\\n aims to house many of our students in the same space, so that they can collaborate, share\\n ideas and experience, and support each other during their studies. This aims to foster a strong\\n sense of community amongst the PGRs. PhD students also automatically receive an £1800\\n travel grant to support conference and meeting attendance during their PhD.\\n\\n\\n Much of the work in the Department requires significant computational support. Some of this\\n infrastructure is provided at the University level and is accessible to all departments. The York\\n Advanced Research Computing Cluster (YARCC) is a heterogeneous cluster of 70 nodes and\\n 1462 cores provided by the University, with 8 nodes supported through the IGGI CDT. The\\n Viking cluster is new in 2019 and represents a £2.5m investment in a 173 node 7024 core\\n computing facility. It also contains 8 NVIDIA GPUs specifically for improved machine learning\\n performance. Most recently, the N8 Centre of Excellence in Computationally Intensive Research\\n has begun to deliver the Bede facility (available to all researchers in the N8 Universities) with 32\\n IBM dual Power 9 CPUs. The Department has also invested in computing facilities, particularly\\n for machine learning. Equipment to the value of more than £100k has been provided for\\n researchers through direct spending and equipment gifts. They support two compute servers\\n with a value of ~£40k and provide four GPU servers with a value of more than £40k.\\n Operational support\\n We have a CS-specific Research Support Office (CSRSO) with 3 dedicated staff to support all\\n aspects of research. This including grant preparation and administration. They operate a grant\\n proposal review system which is also supported by the academics in the Department to help\\n maximise the quality of grant submissions. They also ensure the proper ethical consideration is\\n given to research funding. They also help academics organise conference hosting and\\n management of publications. Each of our research centres also employs a dedicated manager\\n to support their work. We have 14 technical staff to support computing infrastructure and all\\n aspects of the infrastructure for our research including hardware and software. The technicians\\n have a dedicated hardware workshop for building computing equipment. We also have an\\n Impact Champion as a distinct role in the Department. The Impact Champion works closely with\\n a faculty-level Impact Manager to support all aspects of research impact from the conception of\\n a project to commercial impact in industry. Our Athena Swan and Equality Champion oversees\\n our efforts towards improving the working environment of the Department for everyone. We also\\n have a Disability Coordinator who ensures that all disabled members of the Department have\\n access to the support they need to access our facilities. The DC also liaises between the\\n Department and University to help support those with disabilities.\\n The University is part of a number of collaborative groups including the White Rose Partnership\\n (with the Universities of Leeds and Sheffield) and the N8 group of research-intensive northern\\n universities (IES paragraph 6). The White Rose Partnership aids the Department in a number of\\n ways. It provides a repository for all our published papers and supports our drive to open-access\\n (IES paragraph 16). More than 900 research outputs (in the REF period) are available on the\\n repository, the vast majority of which are publicly available due to gold or green open access.\\n The N8 group has helped to deliver advanced computing facilities to CS through the Centre of\\n Excellence in Computationally Intensive Research.\\n 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society\\n CS is an extremely outward looking department and has large numbers of research\\n collaborations from all areas of the world. For example, SciVal reports that CS published papers\\n with 847 different institutions outside the UK in the REF period. The Department encourages\\n research collaboration through a number of mechanisms. It manages a substantial discretionary\\n fund which is distributed to research staff for pump-priming and other research activities\\n including collaboration, impact and research meetings. The average size of the fund was £172k\\n pa over the REF period to the end of 2019. CS also runs a programme of study leave with an\\n open call to all members of staff to enable members of staff to focus on research for a period,\\n and this includes support for research collaboration costs. Study leave has been used to\\n develop collaborations with a wide variety of institutions such as Universidade Federal de\\n Pernambuco (Brazil), Boston University, University of Washington, University of Oxford, UCSD\\n and MIT. We also encourage staff to become involved in research networks and to apply for\\n research fellowships.\\n\\n\\n Fellowships\\n Over the REF period, members of staff have held a number of prestigious funded research\\n fellowships at York. Cavalcanti held a Wolfson Research Merit Award from 2012-2017 and\\n currently holds a Royal Academy of Engineering Chair of Emerging Technologies. Hancock and\\n Cowling had Wolfson Research-Merit Awards (2009-2014 and 2017-2022 respectively). Pears\\n held a RAEng/Leverhulme Senior Research Fellowship (2013-2014) as did Smith (2019-2020).\\n We also hosted the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 Research Fellowship of\\n Giscard at York (2015-2018) and Gaetana Spedalieri holds a Marie Curie Global Fellowship\\n (2017-2020).\\n Our staff also hold significant visiting positions outside York. Cavalcanti was Visiting Professor at\\n Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil (2017 funded by Royal Academy of Engineering).\\n Hancock is Distinguished Visiting Professor at Beihang University and Xiamen University. Davis\\n held an Inria International Chair at Inria, Paris (2014-2018).

      "['Aston University\\nUnit of Assessment: 11 Computer Science and Informatics\\n 1. Unit Context and Structure, Research and Impact strategy\\n 1.1 Context and Structure\\n Aston University was founded in 1895 to support business, local industry and the community, with\\n science and engineering at its core (Institutional Level Environment Statement, ILES1.1). Inclusion\\n and impact are two strong themes running within Aston’s strategy and our success in these areas\\n was recognised in 2020 by several national awards including the “University of the Year”\\n accolade from The Guardian and the “Entrepreneurial University of the Year” award from The\\n Times Higher Education (ILES1.2).\\n Within Aston, the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences (EPS) maintains a high-quality\\n collaborative research environment with focused investment in areas where we can demonstrate\\n internationally leading research with significant impact. The College is submitting research to\\n UoA11 and UoA12. Since 2014, we have enhanced our agile and supportive environment to\\n enable staff to win international, national and regional funding leading to impactful research.\\n Reflecting this, most of our publications involve international co-authors (significantly above\\n sector-average for UoA11) and the majority of our impact case studies are international in scale.\\n For example, Bastin’s development of biodiversity tools at the European Commission’s Joint\\n Research Centre (JRC) has had world-wide impact.\\n The EPS structure (Figure 1) results from the wider re-organization within the University in 2020\\n (ILES2.1). EPS comprises three Schools, each of cognate disciplines: Engineering and\\n Technology; Informatics and Digital Engineering; and Infrastructure and Sustainable Engineering.\\n ASTUTE, EBRI and AIPT, described below, are our overarching Research Institutes. This\\n structure supports an interdisciplinary approach to research and impact, as well as addressing a\\n growing requirement for multi-disciplinary skills for scientists and engineers at all levels (ILES2.9).\\n Aston’s submission to UoA11 comprises Computer Scientists and Mathematicians who sit within\\n the School of Informatics and Digital Engineering and ASTUTE.\\n                     Figure 1: College structure showing Schools, Departments\\n                    and Research Institutes and related impact case study areas\\n                                                                                                  Page 1\\n\\n\\n Knowledge Exchange (KE), underpinned by our research expertise, is fundamental to the College\\n ethos and aligns with Aston’s strategy that emphasises the importance of impact by structuring\\n thinking directly around Aston’s three beneficiary groups: (i) its students, (ii) business, professions\\n and the public sector and (iii) the region and society (ILES1.1). Our research contributes\\n significantly to the regional economy where we have strong collaborations with large companies\\n and SMEs (ILES1.4). Aston is a leading UK university for consultancy and Knowledge Transfer\\n Partnerships (KTPs) – reflecting our strong links with SMEs – and this enables us to identify trends\\n within sectors and opportunities for more in-depth interactions and value-added partnerships.\\n Aston has the largest current KTP portfolio (27) of Midlands Universities, and the 8th largest\\n portfolio in the UK. ASTUTE staff won awards at Innovate UK’s ‘Best of the Best’ KTP Awards in\\n consecutive years: in 2020, The Most Effective KTP initiative, for their work developing the\\n Computer Science Industry Club (Section 4.5) to support KE, and in 2019 in The Best Future\\n Innovator category for a collaboration with Sarissa Biomedical. Industry Club member, Majestic (a\\n Birmingham-based independent technology company providing the largest commercial link\\n database in the world) won the Princess Royal Award for Training in 2018 for their work in a\\n partnership with Aston University to develop a placement year for gifted students. Additionally,\\n one of our ERDF funded innovation projects – Think Beyond Data – will on completion have\\n contributed over £4m GVA to the regional economy.\\n Research Institutes\\n Following REF2014, our priority has been to develop more cohesion between subject-specific\\n research areas. To address this, we have three multi-faceted, collaborative Research Institutes.\\n The Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies (AIPT) and the Energy and Bioproducts Research\\n Institute (EBRI) were two of the four initial University Research Institutes (URIs) created in 2019\\n (ILES2.5). Each URI represents an area of critical mass undertaking excellent research with\\n impact. The Aston Institute for Urban Technologies and the Environment (ASTUTE) was\\n established as a third College Institute in 2018. ASTUTE consolidates interdisciplinary research\\n activities in informatics, materials and logistics to respond to the strategic research challenges in\\n developing low-carbon and sustainable urban environments. Our aspiration is for ASTUTE to\\n obtain URI status in the next REF period. Category A staff submitted to UoA11 are all members\\n of ASTUTE. In addition, reflecting the interdisciplinarity and collaborative nature of our research\\n across the College, 55 Category A staff returned to UoA12 are also members of ASTUTE.\\n The research areas of each of the Institutes are:\\n     •    ASTUTE brings together technologies and capabilities that are key to enabling sustainable\\n          living in the city of the future. At the heart of the Institute’s vision is the idea that\\n          technologies should be developed for the benefit of the urban citizen, contributing to an\\n          improved quality of life by enhancing mobility, creating a greener, more sustainable\\n          environment and extracting the maximum benefit from the vast quantities of data\\n          generated by modern pervasive computing systems. ASTUTE enhances the relationship\\n          between researchers from different but complementary fields such as logistics and data\\n          analytics or machine learning, enabling them to tackle the major interdisciplinary\\n          challenges facing the modern city under the pillars of Digital Engineering, Mobility, Health\\n          and Energy.\\n     •    AIPT focuses on the science and technology of light, integrating both blue-sky and applied\\n          research with education and industrial collaboration. Areas of research excellence include\\n          optical communications, fibre devices, biophotonics and free-space optics.\\n     •    EBRI carries out world-leading research into new and innovative ways of converting\\n          biomass into sources of sustainable energy, using thermochemical, biological and catalytic\\n          processes. EBRI members engage with colleagues nationally and internationally on supply\\n          chains, business models, policy, regulation and system performance.\\n                                                                                                  Page 2\\n\\n\\n 1.2 Research Strategy\\n Aston’s Research Strategy (ILES2.3) is to prioritise impactful, collaborative, excellent and\\n financially sustainable research. Since 2014, EPS strategy has evolved to align with the UK\\n Government’s Industrial Strategy Grand Challenges and UN Sustainable Development Goals to\\n enable us to tackle some of the big societal challenges in an impactful way. Examples involving\\n ASTUTE members are showcased in our impact case studies (ICS):\\n     •   Sustainable cities and communities – where Clark’s (UoA11) ICS “Digital Twins for\\n         Complex System Engineering” demonstrates the impact of his work with Tata Consultancy\\n         Services (TCS) Research. He developed a new agent programming technology for\\n         simulating and analysing complex enterprise systems using digital twin principles. The\\n         results have been used in the field by TCS to improve their ability to provide client\\n         demonstrators and commercial solutions, and the technology has been productized by\\n         TCS as TwinX™.\\n     •   Good health and wellbeing - Buckingham’s (UoA11) ICS “The Galatean Risk and Safety\\n         Technology, GRiST: a web-based system for collaborative mental-health assessment and\\n         management” describes a mental-health clinical decision support system that is delivered\\n         by Aston as a cloud-computing service. It is used around the clock by NHS, charity and\\n         private hospital practitioners to assess and manage risks associated with mental-health\\n         problems. A second ICS, “ECG-derived biosignals for improved healthcare outcomes and\\n         a Real-time Adaptive Predictive Indicator of Deterioration (RAPID)” describes how\\n         research by Herzallah (UoA12) and Lowe (UoA11) led to product improvements in adult\\n         and paediatric healthcare after novel algorithms were implemented into a commercial\\n         system developed by world-leading digital healthcare company, Isansys.\\n     •   Life on Land – where Bastin’s (UoA11) ICS “Development and application of the Digital\\n         Observatory for Protected Areas” stemmed from a research collaboration with the\\n         European Commission’s Joint Research Centre that ultimately saw Bastin as lead\\n         developer of the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas (DOPA). DOPA’s suite of tools\\n         and services are a reliable, transparent and evidence-based source of policy-relevant data\\n         for government departments, agencies and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)\\n         worldwide, including the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity and the European\\n         Commission.\\n The strategic aims of EPS are:\\n Excellence – Strengthening our research environment\\n This strategic strand is led by the Executive Dean (PVC-ED) and the Heads of Institutes (HoIs).\\n The key areas of priority are:\\n   •     Strengthen the interaction between related research activities in informatics,\\n         logistics and materials. This has been achieved by aligning existing areas of activity to\\n         strategic research priorities on infrastructure and urban systems. This led to the formation\\n         of ASTUTE, supported by some strategic appointments in Civil Engineering. By grouping\\n         staff thematically, we have created a more supportive and effective research environment\\n         with growing interdisciplinary research (IDR) links e.g., Saad (ASTUTE) is an investigator\\n         on the £6m TRANSNET programme grant, where he is applying machine learning\\n         techniques to optical communications with AIPT.\\n   •     Strengthen our Institutes as centres of excellence by investing in their facilities and\\n         infrastructure. This led to investment for AIPT of £7.7m in estates, £1.4m in equipment\\n         and £500k in research funding to ensure state of the art facilities. Similarly, for EBRI it\\n         resulted in £1.5m investment in estates, £1m in equipment and £1.5m in research funding.\\n         For Computer Science and Mathematics, we have implemented a £4.5m programme of\\n         office refurbishment to bring staff and PhD students into higher grade spaces with\\n         communal areas to encourage team support and cross fertilisation of ideas.\\n                                                                                               Page 3\\n\\n\\n   •     Create a vibrant research community. To address this, we have built on the IDR\\n         approach to capitalise on connected staff (ILES2.9 and 2.10). To increase research\\n         networking, various IDR activities have been instigated such as “show-and-tell” and\\n         workshop events for researchers and external visitors in areas such as Digital Engineering,\\n         Photonics and Sustainable Engineering. We also pump prime the development of\\n         international collaborations using Aston’s International Collaboration Fund, e.g., the\\n         hosting of Professor Takeshi Akinaga (Akita University) by Generalis in 2019 led to the\\n         subsequent award of an EU RISE project (824022).\\n We will continue to support the development of the Institutes, for example, by further strengthening\\n the high-quality research environment (increased peer mentoring and reviewing for papers and\\n grants), impact (newly launched innovation weeks), business development activities and\\n increasing support for KE activities (ILES4.12). We continue to horizon-scan and nurture emerging\\n areas, e.g., we are currently developing activities in circular economy and health engineering. In\\n addition, we will increase the involvement of social scientists, whose expertise will contribute to\\n the early social acceptability of rapidly developing technologies, such as driverless electric cars\\n and artificial intelligence. These issues align closely with the Living with Technology and Data and\\n Infrastructure focus of ESRC’s plan.\\n Excellence - Strengthening our people\\n This strategic strand is led by the PVC-ED, Associate Dean (Research) (ADR) and HoIs. The key\\n areas of priority are:\\n   •     Grow the number of active researchers in the College and increase the numbers of\\n         researchers working within the Institutes. The number of REF Category A staff has\\n         grown to 34FTE in UoA11 (from 18.20FTE in REF2014). This growth is due to recruitment\\n         of new staff on Teaching and Research contracts, plus the change to submission of 100%\\n         eligible staff. In addition, we have used strategic senior appointments to strengthen and\\n         consolidate specific research areas, e.g., Sawyer in Digital Health and Clark in Multi-agent\\n         Systems. Future growth areas for EPS are sustainable engineering and digital engineering,\\n         the latter encompassed by UoA11.\\n   •     Develop our future research leaders. Mentoring (ILES3.9) and training have proven to\\n         be effective, e.g., Xu came to Aston as Senior Lecturer in Manufacturing Engineering in\\n         2017. Strong support led to a rapid development in his research leadership skills. He was\\n         promoted to a personal chair in 2020 and is now leading the Digital Engineering initiative\\n         within ASTUTE.\\n   •     Strengthen the diversity and inclusivity of our research community. We are making\\n         significant progress in this ongoing project (see Section 2). EPS has moved from Athena\\n         Swan Bronze to Silver in this REF period and will apply for Gold in 2021.\\n   •     Improve the PhD experience. Alongside the work of the Aston Graduate School\\n         (ILES3.15-3.19), we developed a comprehensive PGR training programme with an annual\\n         cohort of 15-30 PhD students (typically 7-8 in UoA11). Funding secured from the EPSRC\\n         Doctoral Training Programme as well as University investments is underpinning this\\n         initiative. For PGRs currently registered in UoA11, 33% are female and 48% are BAME\\n         indicating that we are on track to meet our 2025 diversity targets (see Section 2).\\n Impact Strategy\\n This strategic strand is led by the Deputy Dean (Enterprise and International) (DDEI) working\\n closely with the HoIs. The key areas of priority are:\\n   •     To increase the amount of industry driven research and commercial activity. Support\\n         from professional services colleagues in Research and Knowledge Exchange (RKE)\\n         (ILES1.3, 3.10, 4.5) has facilitated a threefold increase in the annual awards from Industry\\n         sources over the REF period with a further twofold increase in annual awards from ERDF\\n         projects focused on KE.\\n                                                                                                Page 4\\n\\n\\n  •      Promoting links to regional companies. ERDF funding has been used to work directly\\n         across all Institutes to support over 500 SMEs over the REF period. For example, ASTUTE\\n         has supported ERDF projects in data analytics, machine learning, supply chain\\n         management, low carbon industry, additive manufacturing and smart materials. In addition,\\n         a series of seminars has been established in ASTUTE to bring together companies in a\\n         particular sector with relevant academics along with Business Development Managers in\\n         RKE (ILES4.4), who proactively seek out opportunities for KTP projects (ILES2.6) (e.g., a\\n         workshop on Digital Engineering (10/2019) had speakers from MTC, Rolls-Royce and\\n         Arcadis).\\n  •      Supporting impact through investment and flexible contracts. We have used\\n         secondments and investment in equipment to support academics in accelerating impact\\n         For example, Cornford worked part time at Aston to 2018, during which time he was able\\n         to use his research in machine learning and statistical methods to grow the Birmingham\\n         software development base of IGI Ltd, a company that specialises in geochemistry & basin\\n         modelling consultancy. Bastin’s work with the JRC was also enable by two secondments.\\n Through our Institutes and related business development support activities (ILES4.13) we robustly\\n monitor our impact pipeline and support activities at different stages of maturity with financial\\n support, appropriate networking and marketing. An annual programme of ‘Innovation Weeks’ is\\n being used for team building and to train staff and PhD students who can move technology further\\n along the technology readiness levels and address some of the skills gaps we see in SMEs. To\\n encourage staff in this area, impact has been made a key element of Aston’s Research Strategy\\n and is explicitly considered in promotion applications (ILES3.3).\\n Collaboration Strategy\\n This strategic strand is led by the ADR with the HoIs and DDEI. The key areas of priority are:\\n  •      Increase international collaborations for staff and students using both internal funding\\n         (e.g., the International Collaboration Fund (ILES2.9)) and applications to organisations,\\n         including the Leverhulme Trust, Royal Society, the Daiwa Foundation and the EU RISE\\n         scheme. Of all outputs published by staff in UoA11 during the REF period, 65% of\\n         publications have overseas co-authors, 5% ahead of the sector average for the disciplines.\\n  •      Continue to build and support our industry collaborations. Over the REF period we\\n         have developed a portfolio of regional projects to support SMEs (see examples in Section\\n         3.2) and increased our KTP portfolio (Section 4.5). We also launched the award-winning\\n         Industry Club in computer science and then rolled out the model across EPS (Section 4.5).\\n  •      Helping to cement Aston’s position as a Civic University. We are positioning ASTUTE\\n         as the go-to place for regional bodies seeking solutions to the challenges that lie in the way\\n         of Birmingham transitioning to a zero-carbon future. This has required us to establish good\\n         relationships with the West Midlands Combined Authority, the Local Enterprise\\n         Partnerships and Transport for West Midlands and we are planning knowledge sharing\\n         sessions (learning-lunches) with the Digital team within Birmingham City\\n         Council. ASTUTE is a member of the Birmingham Smart City Alliance. As leaders of the\\n         Greater Birmingham and Solihull Institute of Technology (GBSIoT) Applied Research\\n         stream we are organising joint industry-academia hot-topic-based workshops and case\\n         studies to encourage increased collaborative funding applications.\\n Sustainability Strategy\\n This strategic strand is led by the ADR with the HoIs. The key areas of priority are:\\n  •      Broaden the portfolio of funders and increase the amount of UKRI and commercial\\n         funding. We work with professional services departments to ensure the financial\\n         sustainability of EPS research. Colleagues from the funding teams of RKE and Finance\\n         (ILES4.4) work closely with the ADR, HoIs and Departmental Research Directors to share\\n         intelligence about the funding landscape and strategically plan our response, pooling\\n                                                                                                  Page 5\\n\\n\\n         resources and contacts appropriately. The core professional services team meet monthly\\n         to ensure that information about funding opportunities is shared effectively, and that the\\n         necessary resources are put in place to support the pipeline of bidding activity. The\\n         Strategic Funding Manager and International Funding Manager work with individuals and\\n         Research Institutes to plan grant capture strategies and refine grant applications. EPS has\\n         increasingly adopted a cohort-based approach to support groups of individuals who are\\n         preparing bids to the same type of call, for example, the EPSRC New Horizons call where\\n         we had two successful awards, one from an ECR. Similarly, colleagues in RKE run an\\n         annual Grant Writing Programme to support a group of researchers who are applying for\\n         their first Research Council grants (ILES4.5). All bids go through the University’s internal\\n         Peer Review process prior to submission, with the objective of supporting researchers to\\n         improve the quality of bids submitted. Due diligence checks, match-funding decisions and\\n         sign-off of bids also go through a clearly defined process designed to improve the\\n         University’s management of our institutional commitments and to ensure financial probity\\n         and sustainability (ILES2.8).\\n   •     Increase the proportion of staff actively seeking and winning funding by improving\\n         support for early-stage researchers. All ECRs now complete a Career Development\\n         Plan and it is one of the ways we operationalise the Concordat to Support the Career\\n         Development of Researchers (ILES3.13). The Career Development Plan is a framework\\n         that brings together all the help available internally supporting ECRs to plot their own\\n         professional development pathway. At Aston, the ECRs participate in the “ECR Forum”\\n         (ILES3.14) to enhance their ability to work across disciplines, build effective networks and\\n         provide focused developmental opportunities.\\n The success of our College strategy is reflected in EPS being in a much stronger position than in\\n 2014, with our combined research income and income-in-kind for this REF period being £58m, up\\n from £23m in REF2014 (£6.2m, up from £4.1m in UoA11). EPS has contributed just over half of\\n the University’s annual research awards over the REF period. The Research Institutes are\\n providing support for staff and students with the critical mass needed to further strengthen external\\n recognition and momentum.\\n 2. People\\n 2.1 Overview\\n The leadership and governance of EPS has been strengthened significantly since REF2014.\\n Changes include the appointment in 2017 of Professor Sarah Hainsworth OBE FREng, as Pro-\\n Vice-Chancellor and Executive Dean, and the appointment of Professors Tony Clark and Kate\\n Sugden as Deputy Deans in 2018. All three have strong track records in impactful research and\\n understand the challenges of balancing teaching and research commitments. Professor Patricia\\n Thornley took over the Associate Dean (Research) role from Professor David Webb in 2019,\\n ensuring a continuation of strong and effective research leadership. The ADR works with the\\n Director of Research Degree Programmes (Dr Aniko Ekart) and PGR Tutor (Professor Wen Cao).\\n These two roles exist to specifically support research students within the College and share the\\n administrative load, a move that has turned out to be highly beneficial in the pandemic. Our\\n Research Institutes are headed by Professors Webb (ASTUTE), Sergei Turitsyn (AIPT) and\\n Thornley (EBRI).\\n 2.2 Staffing Strategy\\n Significant work has been undertaken over the REF period to ensure that EPS operates in an\\n efficient, cohesive and inclusive manner, allowing people to develop their research careers in a\\n supportive environment. The EPS staffing strategy places equal value on (a) the appointment of\\n external staff in areas that need stronger leadership or to build critical mass, and (b) the\\n development and support of the existing team to create future research leaders.\\n                                                                                                Page 6\\n\\n\\n Since REF2014 we have increased the number of staff in the College to reduce a high student\\n staff ratio and ensure that the staff have time for research (Figure 2). For this REF return, Aston\\n committed to a 100% submission of eligible staff. In UoA11, this has resulted in almost double the\\n number of staff being submitted to REF2021 (34.0FTE, all of whom are on Teaching and\\n Research contracts (6 ECR)) compared to REF2014 (18.2FTE). At the same time, the research\\n only staff population in EPS has also seen significant growth of 47% from 62 to 91FTE, providing\\n a vibrant community of early career researchers.\\n                           Figure 2: Staffing Levels for EPS (UoA11 and 12)\\n New academic appointments are made where there is clear alignment between the appointees’\\n expertise, our existing research activity and our beneficiaries-led research strategy. This has\\n enabled us to build a genuinely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment. For\\n example, the recent appointment of Alexakis in Civil Engineering not only brings research\\n expertise in structural monitoring to that Department, but he also contributes to optical sensing in\\n AIPT and machine learning in ASTUTE.\\n 2.3 Equality Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Strategy\\n Aston is committed to EDI in recruitment, promotion and access to education (ILES3.4-3.6). EPS\\n (UoA11 and 12) has been a leader within the University in this area (for example, it was the first\\n College to achieve Athena Swan Bronze and Silver awards) with significant activity across gender,\\n race and inclusion. The driving philosophy behind our work in this area is that the creation of an\\n inclusive environment is a pre-requisite for the promotion of EDI, and this requires activity against\\n different strands:\\n   •     Diversity in Leadership – The EPS Senior Management team (July 2020) was 43.5%\\n         female and 56.5% male which is exceptional for an engineering-and-science-focused\\n         College. In terms of ethnicity the split is 77.3% white, 22.7% BAME – this is above the\\n         sector average but would benefit from further improvement to reflect our region and student\\n         population. We have just appointed our first female Head of Computer Science – Professor\\n         Lumsden.\\n   •     EPS has been at the forefront of Aston’s Athena Swan initiatives obtaining Silver in\\n         2014 – Prior to the COVID pandemic we were planning to submit a Gold application in\\n         autumn 2020 but this is now delayed until 2021. Our Athena Swan activity in EPS has led\\n         to an improvement in EDI data analytics across the University. Actions put in place in EPS\\n         in the REF period include selected training, mentoring and wide advertising of vacant roles\\n         within the College to allow staff to build experience. As part of the Athena Swan initiative,\\n         we have developed a teaching load model that looks more broadly at the time contribution\\n         for teaching-related activities as well as standard lecturing time to reach a more equitable\\n         distribution of load and ensure all T&R staff have time for research.\\n                                                                                                Page 7\\n\\n\\n  •     Race Equality – EPS’s Director of Operations (Gill-Knobbs) leads on Aston’s Race\\n        Equality Charter, which Aston signed up to in 2019, supported by the Associate PVC for\\n        EDI. The University-wide Group (ILES3.5, Figure 4) is currently working through the results\\n        of the Race Equality Charter Survey and this will generate targeted activities to support\\n        staff and students. The Group also instigated the process for Aston to join the BBSTEM\\n        Alliance (Black British Professions in STEM) to support our Black research students where\\n        numbers are low. The motivation for this came from a working group set up specifically for\\n        Black staff and students following the BLM movement early in 2020. BBSTEM was founded\\n        by EPS graduate Kayisha Payne and provides support in terms of industrial mentors and\\n        corporate insight days which students can access for free. There is also support for PhD\\n        students through an online community. A BAME staff network has been established and\\n        includes research staff. The network will be running research focused events and providing\\n        support for researchers.\\n  •     LGBT+ – EPS Deputy Dean Kate Sugden chairs Aston’s Working Group on LGBT+ staff\\n        (2019-20) (ILES3.5, Figure 4). This also contributes to the open and inclusive culture of\\n        the College and wider University.\\n  •     Gender Pay Gap – The University aims to eliminate its Gender Pay Gap of 19.5% (2017)\\n        by 2025 by focusing on consistency of starting salary and pay parity on promotion and\\n        within professorial bands (ILES3.6). EPS has a significantly smaller pay gap than\\n        elsewhere in the University; over the REF period, EPS has decreased its pay gap from\\n        5.5% (2013) to 2.4% (2020). This has resulted from more consistent mentoring around\\n        promotions and more openness in advertising available roles and responsibilities and\\n        training programmes - changes brought in as part of Athena Swan.\\n  •     External Diversity Activities – EPS staff have also shown significant contribution in this\\n        area. For example, Hainsworth is Chair of the RAEng Diversity and Inclusion Committee\\n        (09/2019-present) and was Deputy Chair for 2 years before that. Through this Committee,\\n        she has made a significant contribution to the development of the RAEng Fellowship Fit\\n        for the Future campaign and the delivery of the new Diversity and Inclusion Framework.\\n        Sugden was elected the Diversity Champion for IET Council (2018-19) and is currently on\\n        the Board of Trustees for Foothold https://www.myfoothold.org/, a charity supporting\\n        engineers and their families with unexpected life challenges. RAEng Visiting Professor\\n        Dawn Bonfield\\'s work supported the addition of “inclusive engineering design” into\\n        accreditation by the Joint Board of Moderators (JBM) as well as similar revision of the\\n        Engineering Accreditation guidelines, AHEP.\\n  •     Widening Participation – Mindful of the development of our future researchers we have\\n        twice hosted the transformative RAEng Graduate Engineering Engagement Programme at\\n        Aston to increase the transition of engineering graduates from diverse backgrounds into\\n        the engineering sector. We have also encouraged Research Institutes to provide paid\\n        internships for students to experience working in a research environment. We supported\\n        the formation of the WEST (Women in Engineering, Science and Technology) society in\\n        2017, and Bonfield pro-actively mentored these students, who rapidly gained confidence\\n        and experience. In 2020, WEST progressed from a student affiliated group to a newly\\n        formed social enterprise, and engaged in a funded project in Nigeria, all with the help and\\n        advice of Bonfield. Through WEST we have sponsored students to attend the annual\\n        Women’s Engineering Society. Finally, Aston contributes to the Widening Participation\\n        strand of the Institute of Coding.\\n                                                                                             Page 8\\n\\n\\n 2.4 Support for Staff\\n Research Culture\\n In EPS we promote a positive research culture to support our academics and researchers\\n throughout the research lifecycle, including:\\n     •   Opportunities to discuss and formulate ideas for research proposals through mentoring;\\n         staff networks and line management; an active seminar series led by the Research\\n         Institutes; and publicising of relevant upcoming funding opportunities by RKE.\\n     •   Research proposal development, in particular for ECRs (including coaching, writing\\n         cohorts and formative peer review), with strong support from EPS staff and RKE (ILES4.4-\\n         4.5).\\n     •   Support for all aspects of research integrity and ethics including support for ethical approval\\n         (ILES2.11-2.12).\\n     •   Support for the dissemination of outcomes of research that transcends traditional\\n         publication routes (Aston Open Data Policy (ILES2.14) and Open Access Policy\\n         (ILES2.15)) and includes dedicated staff in RKE proactively providing links to potential\\n         partners in business, government and industry to translate the outcomes of research into\\n         impact (ILES4.12).\\n     •   To highlight the importance of research in our strategy, EPS introduced protected weeks\\n         within the annual timetable when staff can focus exclusively on research activities.\\n Training and support for ECRs and postdoctoral researchers (PDRs)\\n We are fully committed to implementing the key principles of the Concordat to Support the Career\\n Development of Researchers and indeed Aston has held the “HR Excellence in Research Award”\\n since 2010 (ILES3.13). The University-wide ECR Forum includes the ECR Development\\n Programme (ILES3.14), which includes a range of training courses and workshops run by two\\n specialist members of staff. New research staff receive a Welcome Pack that gathers in one place\\n all the information and documents they will need relating to university services and career\\n development. The activities run by the ECR Forum, including the Annual ECR Interdisciplinary\\n Conference, provide an opportunity for PDRs and ECRs to meet potential collaborators and\\n friends from across the University and develop a mutually supportive network.\\n As part of their induction, academic ECRs are assigned a dedicated research mentor: a colleague\\n who sits outside their line management structure, has a strong research track record, and who\\n acts as a confidential, independent, critical friend. New female appointments are given the option\\n of a female mentor. Additionally, the University facilitates cross-College mentoring relationships\\n (ILES3.9).\\n The Institutes provide vibrant \"homes\" for new researchers, so that they can experience\\n interdisciplinary interactions beyond their departmental affiliation, engage in constructive research\\n development and knowledge exchange, and meet with research users in the industrial, business\\n and policy communities, via our regular seminars and workshops.\\n Staff Training\\n In addition to University-wide training provision (ILES1.5iv, 2.10, 2.12, 3.10, 3.14, 3.16, 4.13) we\\n have introduced a series of initiatives within EPS, which we continue to adapt as the research\\n landscape changes. Recent examples are set out in Table 1.\\n                                                                                                  Page 9\\n\\n\\n                               Table 1: EPS Staff Training Provision\\n  Training for PhD         Alongside the extensive Graduate School introductory programme\\n  students and PDRs        there is also: An Introduction to Research in EPS; Support for\\n                           Fellowship applications\\n  Training for ECRs        Introduction to Research in EPS; Building a Track Record; Working\\n                           with EPSRC; Working with Industry; Working with the EU, Research\\n                           Support; Introduction to REF; Supervising Postdocs and PGRs;\\n                           Impact and How to Generate It; Publishing Considerations, Planning\\n                           for Future Promotion based on Research; Early Career Fellowships\\n  Training for all staff   Health and Safety Awareness; Equality and Diversity*; GDPR*; Cyber\\n                           Security*; Research Student Supervision*; Introduction to\\n                           Unconscious Bias*, Recruitment within the Equalities Framework –\\n                           *courses compulsory for all EPS staff\\n Staff Grades and Promotions\\n The annually monitored data shown in Figure 3 gives the distribution of staff in EPS split by gender.\\n Grade 7 is Teaching Assistant level. Grades 8 and 9 are Lecturers. Grade 10+ are Senior\\n Lecturers and above.\\n                             Figure 3: Gender split of T&R and R staff\\n EPS manages promotions in a fair and equitable way. Over the REF period, 130 applications\\n for promotion were received by the College. Of these, 15 were promoted directly (to grade 8 or 9)\\n and 63 (for higher grades) went forward to the University Promotions Board. The overall success\\n rate there was 85.7%, 89% for female staff and 90% for BAME staff compared to 84% for male\\n                                                                                               Page 10\\n\\n\\n staff and 83.3% for white staff. Overall, there is no significant statistical difference in success rates\\n between the protected groups observed.\\n Selection of Outputs\\n Section D of our Code of Practice sets out the process for selecting outputs, with the peer review\\n process for outputs set out in Appendix 6. Two workshops were run for EPS staff to explain these\\n processes, and those involved in selecting outputs also participated in a comprehensive EDI\\n training session which was developed in conjunction with Advance HE. A further workshop was\\n run for ECR staff to introduce them to the REF process.\\n Our REF Individual Circumstances process (Code of Practice, Appendices 7 and 8) was run\\n independently by RKE. In line with our commitment to an inclusive return, all employees who\\n submitted a declaration of individual circumstances were invited to indicate if they would be like to\\n be contacted by an HR Business Partner to discuss their circumstances, and any support that they\\n may have required.\\n As part of our REF preparation, we have conducted three Equality Impact Assessments of output\\n attributions. Colleagues in RKE and HR have compared outputs attributed to all Category A staff\\n (using FTE, not headcount) with those outputs attributed to those with protected characteristics\\n (gender, age, disability and ethnicity). The inclusive nature of our return is reflected in our final\\n Equality Impact Assessment (conducted 01/2021).\\n UoA11 proposed 234 outputs in total, of which 71 are attributed against an FTE of 34 Category A\\n staff against an attribution target of 85. The UoA11 selection displays a consistent percentage of\\n attributions (mean 37%) across all protected characteristics (Figure 4). Small sample sizes explain\\n any differences.\\n                        Figure 4: Alignment of %FTE and output attributions by\\n                                  protected characteristics for UoA11\\n                                                                                                   Page 11\\n\\n\\n 2.5 Strategy for Training and Supervision of PGR Students\\n Aston’s Graduate School (AGS) was established in 2010 to provide a supportive environment for\\n all research students across the University (ILES3.15-3.18). Integrated with this central provision\\n is subject-specific postgraduate training and development provided within EPS, providing a strong\\n local research environment, where PhD students are supported in their development towards\\n becoming independent researchers.\\n Since 2014, the following significant changes have been made in terms of how we recruit and\\n manage PhD students, in order to achieve and develop a vibrant research environment:\\n Recruitment – A rigorous student recruitment process is in place to ensure that PGRs have the\\n best possible chance of successfully completing their PhD on time. All interview teams must\\n include an independent senior academic with a track record of successful PhD supervision who is\\n able to advise on the suitability of the candidate. English Language training is offered to students\\n for whom English is not their first language (ILES3.19). Typically, 15-30 fully-funded studentships\\n are allocated annually via a highly competitive call, in which both the quality and strategic fit of the\\n project and the suitability of the proposed student are assessed by an experienced panel. Students\\n are increasingly recruited to related cohorts to provide peer support. Strategic priority for these\\n studentships has shifted from an initial focus on co-funding studentships with industry (aligned\\n with our industry-focused research strategy) to concentrating on pump-priming the research\\n careers of our new lecturers, following a significant expansion of new academic staff in EPS. All\\n staff with supervision responsibility are required to complete mandatory supervision training, which\\n must be updated every three years, regardless of career stage (ILES3.16).\\n Arrival – Following each quarterly start date, there is a comprehensive welcome and induction\\n session provided by the Director of Research Degree Programmes, where students are guided\\n through all the relevant documentation, development opportunities and the expectations placed\\n on them. In consultation with the supervisor, the student undertakes a training needs analysis to\\n identify the development needed to support both their PhD work and their future career goals.\\n During the PhD – AGS provides comprehensive PGR support for all students (ILES3.15-3.19). A\\n formal quarterly and annual monitoring process is in place to ensure students are making sufficient\\n progress and are well supported by their academic supervisors. In addition, international students\\n are invited to networking events for international students and staff, to help them feel included in\\n the research community and make links with others who may have similar experiences.\\n In response to data from the 2017 Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES), several\\n new initiatives were instigated including:\\n      •   Increased contribution of up to £1500 towards attending a conference to present a paper\\n          or poster. This is available to all students who have completed their qualifying examination.\\n      •   A Postgraduate Student-Staff Liaison Committee to provide a direct link between PGR\\n          students and senior management via the AGS Management Committee (ILES3.15). In\\n          addition, student representatives meet with the ADR and Director of Research Degree\\n          Programmes to discuss any College-level issues they may be having. As an example,\\n          reports of issues with aging computers led to a College policy whereby all incoming PGRs\\n          are given a new PC on arrival.\\n      •   We introduced an EPS PGR Conference in 2018, organised by postgraduate student\\n          representatives of the Liaison Committee. This was much appreciated by the students and\\n          the idea has been taken up by AGS, which now also facilitates University-wide weekly\\n          events such the Interdisciplinary Seminar Series (ILES2.10).\\n Student networks – Our PhD students are integrated into the research community and relevant\\n networks to provide peer support. Our office spaces have been redeveloped to ensure that\\n students sit within the academic groups and share communal spaces. The Women in Science and\\n Technology group provides networking support across all student groups and regularly hosts\\n visiting speakers from industry. ASTUTE holds monthly research seminars for all its staff; these\\n have an interdisciplinary focus and help create links between different research specialisms.\\n                                                                                                Page 12\\n\\n\\n These are organised by an ECR to help develop management and organisational skills and raise\\n their profile.\\n Graduate Outcomes – The most recent (2017/18) Graduate Outcomes survey available for the\\n assessment period (27 EPS responses) showed that 96% of EPS PGR graduates found graduate\\n level positions. 30% took up Postdoctoral Research Assistant positions, 15% secured academic\\n positions, 18% continued in further education, and the remaining 33% went into professional-level\\n work in industry.\\n Diversity of PGR student body – EPS has prioritised diversification of our PGR population by\\n ensuring fair recruitment processes. The Home BAME PGR student population has risen from\\n 39% (2015/16) to 43% (2019/20). In terms of gender, our objective is 40% female PGR by 2025\\n and we have improved steadily from 29% female PhD students in 2015/16 to 38% female in\\n 2019/20. Our current intake across the College is 50% female and 64% BME, indicating we are\\n on track to meet our diversity targets. This improvement stems from targeted interventions, such\\n as: (a) involving our own UG students more in projects related to research, (b) supporting student\\n networks that cross over the PG/UG divide so that there are appropriate role models, (c) more\\n widespread advertising of opportunities (d) interview practices including mixed panels.\\n Figure 5 shows diversity data covering the REF period for the Computer Science and Mathematics\\n Departments, which map closely to UoA11.\\n                           Figure 5: Diversity data for Computer Science and\\n                            Mathematics PGR students - over the REF period\\n 3. Income, Infrastructure and Facilities\\n The overall aim of EPS in this REF period has been to build the strength of our teams,\\n infrastructure and facilities in areas where we can deliver impact on an international scale and use\\n this to drive growth in research activity.\\n The move towards Institutes, and the increasing focus of our research into related disciplines,\\n allowed us to invest in infrastructure to benefit large groups of individual researchers. Through this\\n approach, we have brought together research teams to create a more dynamic, interactive and\\n supportive environment. This has included £4.5m investment in new, clustered staff workspaces\\n which co-locate Computer Science and Mathematics academic staff, researchers and research\\n students. Where appropriate, researchers are encouraged to belong to, and access, more than\\n one Research Institute to encourage interdisciplinary interactions, for example, there are Civil and\\n Biomedical engineers from ASTUTE who have AIPT laboratory space and Mechanical Engineers\\n working in EBRI and ASTUTE. The total capital expenditure over the REF period on EPS research\\n was £16.6m.\\n                                                                                               Page 13\\n\\n\\n 3.1 Research Income and Awards\\n The UoA11 Income has grown from £4.1m in REF 2014 to £6.2m in REF2021, the annual\\n breakdown for which is shown in Figure 6.\\n                                 Figure 6: UoA11 Research Income\\n UoA11’s annual research awards have grown from less than £750k in 2013/14 to over £2m in\\n 2019/20 (Figure 7). At College level, EPS has grown its annual research awards substantially from\\n £8.4m in 2013/14 to an average of £15.7m/year in the last three years of this REF period. This\\n growth will drive an increase in research income in the next REF period.\\n                                 Figure 7: UoA11 Research Awards\\n 3.2 Infrastructure and Facilities Pertaining to Research\\n Our investment in infrastructure and facilities has underpinned the growth in income and awards.\\n For UoA11, it is important to note that these activities take place within a larger support framework\\n at both College and University level. Specialist centralised research support is led by the PVC\\n Research and the Executive Director of Business Engagement (ILES4.4). EPS benefits from a\\n high-performing team who generate fruitful industrial connections, support large collaborative\\n grant applications and project manage large projects. This has resulted in the College’s strong\\n position in KTP grants where we are a sector leader and have substantial EU research funding\\n (16 of the University’s 19 current KTP projects are in UoA11). Furthermore, there exists a critical\\n mass of colleagues with experience in successful knowledge exchange, who act as impact\\n champions and mentors. All our Institutes have embedded business engagement teams that use\\n ERDF funding to provide the infrastructure and support collaboration with regional businesses,\\n which is matched by an equal funding contribution from the University. The facilities and\\n infrastructure for each of the Research Institutes is summarised below.\\n                                                                                                Page 14\\n\\n\\n Aston Institute for Urban Technologies and the Environment\\n In addition to having access to the AIPT and EBRI facilities described below, ASTUTE also has\\n facilities that support the variety of research activities in the Institute, including:\\n      •   The Aston Laboratory for Immersive Virtual Environments, resulting from a £3.9m\\n          investment in 2015, provides motion capture, room-scale virtual reality and EEG recording\\n          equipment, enabling research into visual perception, social cognition, and social vision.\\n          This is complemented by the Aston Interactive Media Lab, which is dedicated to human-\\n          computer interaction, primarily applied to mobile technologies.\\n      •   The Aston Robotics, Vision and Intelligent Systems lab houses a variety of predominantly\\n          social robots and aims to improve mankind’s quality of life by enabling intelligent robots,\\n          virtual agents and autonomous systems with perceptual and cognitive capabilities.\\n      •   Investment of £80k from GBS Institute of Technology has enabled a laboratory dedicated\\n          to Cyber Security. Vulnerable network systems can be simulated, attacked and defended\\n          within an isolated environment.\\n      •   Our significant activity around data analytics and AI is supported by a range of computing\\n          options. Researchers can access individual GPU-based workstations, a new shared server\\n          (8GPU, 20 core, 512 GB, £50k), cloud-based processing (e.g., Amazon Web Services)\\n          and the Tier 2 HPC facility of Midlands Innovation (ILES1.5).\\n      •   We have a wide range of facilities supporting our research on future transport including\\n          equipment to test high-performance electrical machines, power converters and EV\\n          batteries to enable bespoke design as well as the ability to assess the performance of\\n          engines running on biofuels\\n      •   Researchers investigating functional materials have accessed £2.4m of beam time during\\n          this REF period.\\n Since the formation of ASTUTE in 2018, the number of KTP projects in the Institute has increased\\n from 5 to 17. In terms of fundamental research, Aston’s two successes in the recent EPSRC New\\n Horizons call were both from ASTUTE members (one an ECR) and 2020 saw the submission of\\n a successful EU FET proposal in collaboration with colleagues in Health and Life Sciences plus\\n international partners.\\n ERDF projects continue to deliver measurable benefit to our regional beneficiaries. The Think\\n Beyond Data project aimed at enabling SMEs to make better use of their data, to develop new\\n services and products, to leverage large public datasets, and to develop a workforce that is highly\\n skilled in leading-edge analytical techniques. An evaluation report by Hatch Regeneris\\n (2020) noted that the team supported 60 companies, with estimated additional GVA expected to\\n reach almost £4m, providing £6.45 GVA for every £1 ERDF funding invested. This excellent value\\n for money is reflected in the subsequent extension of the project.\\n A second project, Smarterials - Promoting Functional Materials, in SMEs, sits between ASTUTE\\n and EBRI. This project commenced in 09/2018 and will run until 08/2021. It is designed to help 66\\n SMEs develop their use of functional materials and grow their business through a partnership with\\n Aston University built on research, testing and expertise in material science. The collaborations\\n with industry have been diverse: from working with a fuel additive manufacturer to verify the\\n efficiency gains that it brings to an engine, to working with a wind turbine developer to create\\n prototype designs from optimum materials.\\n                                                                                              Page 15\\n\\n\\n Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies\\n AIPT has outstanding facilities and infrastructure enhanced by recent major strategic investment\\n by Aston University. This includes a £7.3m investment in 2017 into a new, 1200 square metre,\\n state-of-the-art suite of 30 laboratories for the Institute, including optical communication, fibre\\n device fabrication, laser, medical and biophotonics laboratories. In parallel, Aston invested around\\n £5m into equipment, with a further £3m invested in equipment after AIPT was awarded University\\n Research Institute status in 2019. The breadth of these facilities makes AIPT a partner of choice\\n for many businesses and universities giving AIPT an impressive reach. This includes a portfolio\\n of ~60 industrial and international collaborations, 60 patents, and five spin-out companies.\\n AIPT’s global status is further confirmed by the coordination (as a single beneficiary) of a major\\n €3m Marie S. Curie COFUND MULTIPLY Photonics Training Programme, with 50 world leading\\n partners, from MIT to the Max Plank institute for the Science of Light.\\n Energy and Bioproducts Research Institute\\n EBRI’s dedicated building incorporates unique, state-of-the-art laboratories, collaborative office\\n space, dedicated meeting/engagement rooms, and social facilities to support its academic and\\n industry facing teams in accelerating the commercial development of low-carbon energy and\\n products. The facilities are the result of a £20m investment to support the development of a\\n regional bioenergy supply chain and to promote the adoption of innovative new bioenergy\\n technologies across the West Midlands region. EBRI’s research extends from fundamental\\n science through engineering challenges, social responses to technologies, economic context and\\n policy development. It leads the £6m national flagship EPSRC/BBSRC-funded Supergen\\n Bioenergy Hub research centre of excellence which works with academia, industry, government\\n and societal stakeholders to develop sustainable bioenergy systems that support the UK’s\\n transition to an affordable, resilient, low-carbon energy future.\\n 4. Collaboration and Contribution to the Research Base, Economy and Society\\n 4.1 Introduction\\n EPS values collaboration with academic, industry and policy partners, both nationally and\\n internationally. In addition, wide-ranging activities in Knowledge Exchange such as KTP and\\n business focused ERDF funding have generated strong links to industry – especially the technical\\n SME community.\\n 4.2 International Collaboration and Networks\\n Our Research Institutes collaborate with high-performing institutions and industry partners around\\n the world, allowing regular exchange of people and ideas. This has in turn enabled our research\\n to create impact on an international scale. For example:\\n     •    In our UoA11 ICSs: “Development and Application of the Digital Observatory for Protected\\n          Areas”, which resulted in tools that have been used globally, and “Digital Twins”, which\\n          arose from a longstanding collaboration of Clark with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)\\n          Research in India. The first ICS arose from time spent working at the European\\n          Commission’s Joint Research Centre and the second from an ongoing research\\n          collaboration that involves annual research visits to the company, where Clark is funded\\n          as a Research Advisor. In 2019, Clark’s work won a TCS Innovation Award in competition\\n          with over 6000 entries.\\n     •    Buckingham’s collaboration with Johns Hopkins University investigated racial bias during\\n          clinical diagnosis in the UK and the US; a Race Equality Foundation report used the\\n          findings to recommend improvements for Black people’s healthcare.\\n     •    Little, Arora and Raykov worked with a number of international partners including MIT,\\n          Johns Hopkins University and the Michael J Fox Foundation on ground-breaking work on\\n                                                                                               Page 16\\n\\n\\n         the use of smartphones for detecting and monitoring the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease\\n         and the large-scale deployment of wearable sensor to monitor Parkinson’s Patients for the\\n         Parkinson@Home study. The end goal of this work is to establish a better platform for the\\n         long-term management of Parkinson’s disease and improved drug efficacy tests.\\n     •   Several staff have longstanding international collaborations: Lumsden and Campelo both\\n         hold Adjunct Professorships at Canadian universities (University of New Brunswick and\\n         Dalhousie University); Nerukh holds a Visiting Scientist position at RIKEN in Japan and\\n         supervises PhD students at Kiev University, supported by funding from the EU Research\\n         and Innovation Staff Exchange (RISE) scheme.\\n     •   Since 2014, EPS has received funding for 18 international networking RISE projects, as\\n         lead and partner, providing £9m to support collaborative research, networking and training\\n         with industry and academia across the world. They have enabled collaboration with\\n         academics from 40 countries on applied and theoretical projects; examples from UoA11\\n         range from “Computing with Infinite Data” to “Fractures Across Scales, Materials,\\n         Processes and Disciplines”.\\n     •   Aston is within the top ten UK recipients for the highly competitive FET programme and\\n         the projects that Aston leads are excellent examples of IDR, e.g., the recently successful\\n         application for the £4m NeuChip project with Aston Principal Investigator (PI) Dr Rhein\\n         Parri (Institute of Neurodevelopment), Co-PI Prof David Saad (ASTUTE, Mathematics). The\\n         project partners are the University of Barcelona, 3Brain (industry), Technion (Israel), CNRS\\n         Paris (France) and Loughborough University (UK).\\n     •   In addition to the International Collaboration Fund (ILES2.9), UoA11 academics exploit a\\n         range of other funding mechanisms including Royal Society International Exchange,\\n         RIKEN Japan, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Bridge Fellowship, EU\\n         Twinning, Erasmus+, Leverhulme Trust Distinguished Visiting Professorship, Erasmus+\\n         and British Council. Furthermore, our policy of recruiting from the widest possible field\\n         brings staff members from across the globe with ready-made international links e.g., from\\n         Computer Science, Campelo has strong links to Brazil (particularly the power industry\\n         there), while in Mathematics, Nerukh has ongoing collaborations in Ukraine, and\\n         Chattopadhyay with India.\\n 4.3 Academic Outputs (UoA11)\\n Our networking strategy has produced a significant impact on international collaborative outputs.\\n Of the 1908 published outputs by UoA11 Category A staff in this REF period, 65% were the result\\n of international collaboration vs a sector average of about 60% for the disciplines (SciVal,\\n December 2020). Of the internationally collaborative papers, 53% were from partners within\\n Europe 26% from Asia Pacific and 11% from North America.\\n 4.4 Research Community\\n In addition to our funded networks, EPS strongly encourages colleagues to contribute to the wider\\n research community. This includes:\\n  •      Journal editing: Associate Editor (2019-present) of IEEE Transactions on Software\\n         Engineering (Bencomo); Editorial Board Member (2019-present) of the Journal of Software\\n         and Systems Modeling (Bencomo); Frontiers Research Topic Editor (2020, Bernardet);\\n         Editorial Board Member (2019- present) of the Journal of Software and Systems Modeling\\n         (Bencomo); Editor (2019) of a special issue of the International Journal of Computer\\n         Integrated Manufacturing, Volume 32, Issue 4-5 (Ekart); Editor in Chief (2008-present) of\\n         the International Journal of Mobile Human Computer Interaction (Lumsden); Guest Editor\\n         (2016–2017) of Science & Justice (Morrison); Guest Editor (2016–2019) of Speech\\n         Communication (Morrison); Editorial Board Member (2012-present) of Scientific Reports\\n         (Saad); and Associate Editor (2006-present) of IEEE Intelligent Systems (Zhuge).\\n                                                                                               Page 17\\n\\n\\n  •     Contribution to conference organisation: Member (2020-present) of the IEEE Technical\\n        Council on Software Engineering (Bencomo); Program Committee Member (2020) for the\\n        International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (Bernardet),\\n        Program Committee Member for 2020 CHI (Human Factors in Computing Systems)\\n        (Bernardet); Programme Committee Member (2013-present) of the KES International\\n        Conference on Innovation in Medicine and Healthcare (Buckingham); Programme\\n        Committee Co-Chair for ISEC 2021 (Clark); Publication Chair (2018), Chair (2019), Co-\\n        Chair (2020) for the 7th, 8th and 9th EvoMUSART, the International Conference on\\n        Computational Intelligence in Music, Sound, Art and Design (Ekart); Chair (2017), Co-Chair\\n        (2018) of the Digital Entertainment Technologies and Arts track at the Genetic and\\n        Evolutionary Computation Conference (Ekart); Programme and Steering Committee\\n        Member for the European Conference on Genetic Programming throughout the period\\n        (Ekart); Conference Chair (2015) for the IMA (Institute of Mathematics and its Applications)\\n        Conference on Mathematics of Robotics (Holderbaum); Committee Member, Mobile HCI\\n        2015 2nd Workshop on Designing with Older Adults: Towards a Complete Methodology\\n        Workshop (Lumsden); Associate Chair (Papers), Interaction Design & Children 2016\\n        Doctoral Consortium Chair (Lumsden); Associate Chair (Papers) NordiCHI\\'2020\\n        (Lumsden); Committee Member (2014-2020) for the European Symposium on Artificial\\n        Neural Networks ESANN (Saad); and Co-organiser (2015) of the Royal Society meeting\\n        on Communication Networks Beyond the Capacity Crunch (Ellis, Saad and Payne\\n        (Southampton)).\\n 4.5 Knowledge Exchange\\n Within EPS we have a variety of platforms to engage with industrial partners, government and\\n Professional Engineering Institutions, which work together to support knowledge exchange and\\n present a coherent pathway for company–university interactions. These include:\\n  •     European Regional Development Funding (ERDF) - This allows each Research Institute\\n        a platform for regional knowledge exchange with six projects associated with ASTUTE\\n        running on the REF census date (AgriTech, Smarterials, UK Centric Supply Chains, Low\\n        Carbon SMEs, Think Beyond Data, ETICC). In 2020 alone, 200 enterprises were\\n        supported by EPS through these projects. All ERDF-funded business support programmes\\n        are independently evaluated upon completion. Analysis from these evaluations show\\n        participating companies benefit from faster growth, sustainable job creation, graduates\\n        retained in the region and increased GVA; for an example, see the description of Think\\n        Beyond Data in Section 3.2.\\n  •     Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs) - We have grown our KTP activity, with strong\\n        centralised support and referrals from the ERDF projects and the Industry Clubs. Aston’s\\n        portfolio is dominated by EPS projects; there have been 32 KTP projects over the REF\\n        period, totalling £6,374,896 in funding, and 19 of these have been from UoA11. In terms\\n        of outputs, analysis of KTP reports showed Aston generated on average 1107% return-on-\\n        investment (ILES1.4). We host a high profile annual KTP poster event, which allows our\\n        beneficiaries and research teams to network and understand the benefits of knowledge\\n        exchange and promote wider KE opportunities. In UoA11, recent KTP success includes\\n        the 2019 Future Innovators Award for KTP associate Gallo working with Sarissa\\n        Biomedical.\\n  •     Industry Clubs (ICs) - The award-winning EPS model of ICs, which originated in\\n        Computer Science (CS), has since been rolled out across the College and has generated\\n        significant benefit to both students and researchers. The objective is to harness cutting-\\n        edge industry expertise to generate high-level graduate opportunities, enhance the skills\\n        of students and develop new research opportunities. The CS IC brings together students,\\n        academic members of staff and around 15 local technology businesses who provide both\\n        financial and in-kind support. It has supported >80 placements and graduate roles, guest\\n        lectures, company input into student projects, Insight days and curriculum input. Within\\n        UoA11, the ICs have provided the basis for 15 KTP projects worth> £3m, joint funding for\\n                                                                                             Page 18\\n\\n\\n          4 PhD studentships (Geospatial Insight, Beazley and Arcadis) and a £590k EPSRC project\\n          (EP/T017627/1).\\n   •      Collaborative Research Grants – In UoA11 we have also had success with collaborative\\n          Innovate UK research projects, including Lumsden’s “Mapmydiabetes”, a collaboration\\n          with Mapmyhealth Ltd providing mobile diabetes education and self-management support,\\n          and He’s “Big Data Content Analytics with particular reference to Probabilistic Neural Topic\\n          Models”, which involved the development of a content analytics toolset with Foldingspace.\\n   •      Informing policy Buckingham’s research applying computer science in the health sector\\n          has had significant impact (ICS ‘The Galatean Risk and Safety Technology – Grist’); his\\n          work on clinical bias due to race has prompted the Race Equality Foundation to\\n          recommend improvements for Black people\\'s health care. The international scale of the\\n          policy impact of Bastin\\'s development of the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas is\\n          highlighted in Section 1.2.\\n 4.6 Wider Contribution to Society\\n The Aston Strategy 2018-23 has our beneficiaries approach at its core (ILES1.1), and EPS has a\\n strong history of outreach and masterclasses to engage the wider community with our research\\n activities, driving our student diversity and our strong links to business and the region; indeed\\n outreach is explicitly written into many of our grant applications. Examples of our higher profile\\n events where a strong link between science and arts boosts accessibility include:\\n     •    Lightfest (2015) was a flagship UK initiative for the UNESCO International Year of Light\\n          celebrations. Held at the newly opened Library of Birmingham, it was funded as a\\n          European Commission Researchers Night activity, attracted 12,500 visitors and involved\\n          100 researchers and 33 additional Aston volunteers. A follow-up event Cityfest, focused\\n          on Smart Cities was due to run at the Birmingham Museum in 2020 but was delayed due\\n          to Covid (re-scheduled for July 2022).\\n     •    EPS was invited to participate in a high-profile event in Hong Kong SPARK: The Science\\n          and Art of Creativity (2019) which was organised by the British Council.

Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n 1.1 Unit context and structure\\n Founded in 1957, the Department of Computer Science and Information Systems is one of\\n the oldest computing departments world-wide and one of four departments in the School of\\n Business, Economics and Informatics (BEI). Historically a small department (18.8 FTE\\n returned to REF2014), we have grown by 30% since REF2014. Having a long-established\\n reputation in data management and computational intelligence, we have evolved into a world-\\n leading centre in Algorithms, Data Science, Knowledge Representation, and Verification, as\\n evidenced by (i) our Q1 position for research outputs in REF2014; (ii) subsequent 70% growth in\\n the number of publications, in such highly prestigious venues as JACM, AIJ, JAIR, JMLR,\\n IEEE TKDE, IEEE TSE, TPAMI, FOCS, PODS, LICS, IJCAI; (iii) 50% growth in research grant\\n awards; (iv) rapidly expanding network of international, interdisciplinary, industrial and public-\\n sector collaborators.\\n Our REF2014 results highlighted our strengths in algorithms and theory, leading to an\\n ambitious development programme which expanded and refocused our research into three\\n Groups: Knowledge Representation & Data Management, Experimental Data Science and\\n Algorithms, Verification & Software; and two research Centres: Birkbeck Institute for Data\\n Analytics (BIDA) and Birkbeck Knowledge Lab (BKL). The Groups focus on specific areas of\\n computer science, with fluid boundaries facilitating inter-group collaborations and\\n departmental cohesion. The Centres are interdisciplinary, spearheading new collaborations\\n within and beyond the College.\\n BIDA was established in 2015 to focus the development of college-wide research in data\\n science, combining our expertise with domain-specific knowledge from all disciplinary areas at\\n Birkbeck: Sciences, Social Sciences, Law, Arts & Humanities.\\n BKL was launched in 2016, extending the legacy of the London Knowledge Lab (2001–2015),\\n a joint initiative with the UCL Institute of Education. BKL’s research draws upon multi- and\\n interdisciplinary perspectives to investigate how digital technologies are transforming our\\n learning, working and cultural lives.\\n The Department’s research capacity is further enhanced through participation in the Institute\\n of Coding (IoC), a national OfS initiative to address the UK’s digital skills gap, with 60+\\n universities and industry partners. The IoC synergistically supports our research and impact\\n strategies through academic staff posts and targeted programme development (for example,\\n through a collaborative PGCert with the British Library and National Archives).\\n 1.2 Research strategy\\n We develop our research and impact strategies in the context of two overarching aims:\\n -   to be a world-leading research centre with complementary expertise in both theoretical\\n     and applied computer science;\\n -   driven by Birkbeck’s mission, to develop flexible opportunities in cutting-edge computer\\n     science for a diverse range of students, particularly working Londoners.\\n The latter provides unique opportunities to engage, through students bringing real-world\\n problems driven by their work environment, with a range of IT companies and other\\n                                                                                                 Page 1\\n\\n\\n organisations.\\n Review of REF2014 research strategy. As stated in our REF2014 environment narrative, we\\n have “investigated fundamental research problems whose solution advances knowledge in the\\n discipline, and undertaken collaborative research with partners from other disciplines that\\n exploits and enhances our expertise” and have achieved significant advances in all the focus\\n areas identified therein (see below).\\n Post-REF2014 strategy. Our research strategy over the census period, and continuing into the\\n next five years, is based on seven key principles:\\n (R1) Recruit internationally excellent staff whose research enhances our strategic directions\\n       (detailed below).\\n (R2) Foster an environment of inclusivity and equality, where all researchers can thrive and\\n       fulfil their potential.\\n (R3) Promote research leadership, enabling collaboration and support within and across the\\n       research groups, including support for research career development.\\n (R4) Maintain research excellence and innovation in core computer science, investigating\\n       fundamental problems in both theory and practice, spearheading the development of new\\n       technologies.\\n (R5) Carry out world-leading interdisciplinary research, recognising that computer science is\\n       pervasive in all areas of society.\\n (R6) Amplify the impact of our research through collaboration with organisations across the\\n       public, private and third sectors—nationally, internationally and across disciplines.\\n (R7) Provide all researchers with the environment they need to pursue research in their\\n       chosen fields, including purpose-built labs, specialist hardware and software, and\\n       financial and technical support.\\n Our research and impact strategies are articulated and regularly reviewed by the department’s\\n Research Committee, which horizon scans to identify strategically significant emerging areas of\\n research that dovetail with our existing profile. Its Chair is a member of the School Research\\n Committee, which develops and shares best practice across BEI, monitors research student\\n recruitment and progression, and works to enhance BEI’s research environment. The School\\n Research Committee articulates with the College’s Research Committee and Research Strategy\\n Group through its Chair, BEI’s Assistant Dean for Research (this was Poulovassilis till summer\\n 2015 when she was appointed Deputy Dean for Research Enhancement, continuing as a BEI\\n member of the College Research Committee).\\n Strategic areas of research. Driven by principles (R1)-(R7), we made significant changes to\\n our staffing and organisation of research since REF2014, reflecting our vision for this census\\n period and beyond:\\n First, we refocused the Computational Intelligence group into Experimental Data Science (EDS)\\n and enhanced it with three new appointments, researching data-driven methods for cloud\\n computing, bioinformatics and IoT security.\\n In recognition of our emerging strength in Algorithms, Verification & Software (AVS), we created\\n a new group in this area and further strengthened it by appointing two experts in automated\\n program analysis/verification and algorithmic graph theory.\\n                                                                                              Page 2\\n\\n\\n The Information Management & Web Technologies group was refocused to Knowledge\\n Representation & Data Management (KRDM) accompanied by three appointments: in database\\n theory, constraint satisfaction and logic; in temporal representation and reasoning; and in graph\\n data management.\\n Finally, we launched BIDA and recruited its director, who also strengthens EDS research in\\n experimental algorithmics and data analytics.\\n KRDM strategy. KRDM addresses challenges arising from managing, accessing and exploiting\\n heterogeneous high-volume data, with particular focus on logic-based approaches, database\\n theory and related computational complexity problems, and graph data management. Since\\n REF2014 we have published 70+ journal and 170+ conference papers, including in highly\\n prestigious venues such as JACM (2 papers), AIJ(5), TOCL(4), LMCS(2), JAIR(2), PODS(5),\\n ICDT(3), IJCAI(7), LICS(6).\\n Ground-breaking advances have been made in first-order model checking in the context of\\n database theory, logic and complexity (H.Chen); complexity and succinctness theory for ontology-\\n based data access (OBDA); foundations of temporal OBDA; and game-theoretic\\n characterisations of query inseparability and of the Horn fragments of description and first-order\\n guarded logics (Kontchakov, Ryzhikov, Zakharyaschev). Fundamental advances have been\\n made in flexible processing of graph queries (Cali, Poulovassilis, Wood); quality-driven data\\n integration (Martin, Poulovassilis); designing the first logic-based language for JSON\\n transformation and querying (Hidders); and axiomatising and classifying algebras of functions\\n with composition and (anti)domain/range – an emergent tool in program verification (Mikulas).\\n Over the next five years KRDM will focus on:\\n   -  fundamental problems in computer science logic, including database theory, constraint\\n      satisfaction, complexity of ontology-mediated query answering;\\n   -  developing techniques for intelligent data access, integration and management, in\\n      collaboration with partners in industry;\\n   -  contributing to new industry standards in graph data management.\\n AVS strategy. AVS addresses the efficiency of computation, including theory, design and\\n implementation, with several foci: foundations of algorithms and computational complexity,\\n algorithm design, and analysis and verification of systems and software. Since REF2014, we\\n have published 65+ journal and 85+ conference papers, including in ACM TAGL (1 paper),\\n JCSS(4), IEEE TSE(2), ACM TOCT(3), FOCS(3), SODA(1), STACS(2), ICALP(4), POPL(2),\\n ICSE(2), LICS(2), IJCAR(3), TACAS(3), CONCUR(3).\\n We do not shy away from notorious open problems, such as reconstructing graph properties\\n from subsets of vertex-deleted subgraphs (Fenner); inference of worst-case runtime complexity\\n bounds and size bounds for programs on integers; satisfiability for separation logic with inductive\\n definitions (Fuhs); the Matroid variation of the famous Secretary Problem; and lower bounds for\\n relaxed locally decodable codes (Lachish). Other ground-breaking advances have been made in\\n propositional knowledge representation and order theory (Razgon); and algorithmic techniques\\n for sparse graph classes (Reidl). Fundamental advances have been made in automated\\n termination analysis of higher-order programs (Fuhs); theory and verification algorithms for fuzzy\\n systems (Han); automated approaches to improve the quality of API documentation (T.Chen);\\n and algorithmic approaches to learning neural architecture hyperparameters and ensembles\\n (Magoulas).\\n Over the next five years AVS will focus on:\\n                                                                                               Page 3\\n\\n\\n   -   computational complexity; randomised algorithms and their applications; theory and real-\\n       world applications of graph width measures and notions of structural sparseness;\\n   -   verification techniques for emerging paradigms such as probabilistic, neural and quantum\\n       programming;\\n   -   application of machine learning and NLP to software engineering problems such as\\n       program synthesis;\\n   -   deep learning for modelling, classification, and autonomous control.\\n EDS strategy. EDS develops novel methods and systems for the computational analysis of\\n data. A core ingredient is the exploitation of metadata, observations and measurements from\\n large-scale information systems to ground testable theory, conduct experimentation and\\n enable practical application of research outcomes, leading to demonstrable economic and\\n societal impacts.\\n Since REF2014, we have published 140+ journal and 120+ conference papers, including in\\n TPAMI (9 papers), IEEE TKDE(2), IEEE TIFS(2), IEEE TSC(2), JoCCH(2), Scientometrics(2),\\n JASIST(2), TACL(2), PLoS One(3).\\n We have made significant advances in data analytics for Parkinson’s disease, deployed in\\n clinical trials in the UK, USA, Germany and Belgium and released as open-source software\\n (Roussos, Weston); named entity recognition and sentiment analysis (Levene, Weston, Zhang);\\n resource usage optimisation and real-time anomaly detection (Sotiriadis); data-driven cyber\\n security techniques, receiving a Samsung research award (Yoo); a Fisher-Rao metric for\\n curves using edge information (Maybank); topological patterns of network evolution\\n characteristic of trustworthy actors (Provetti); deep neural network techniques for predicting\\n human protein function (Wan).\\n Over the next five years EDS will focus on:\\n       – modelling social and human dynamics employing spatio-temporal probabilistic models;\\n       – disease progression assessment using mobile and wearable devices;\\n       – deep learning methods, with biomedical, cloud computing and security applications;\\n       – applications of NLP in sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and distributional\\n         representations of language.\\n BIDA strategy. Through its network of collaborations and external partnerships, BIDA\\n provides a vibrant environment for a next generation of data scientists. Collaborations are\\n often conceived through BIDA’s regular workshops, convened to explore cross-disciplinary\\n perspectives on specific topics and challenges. New collaborations have been forged with\\n Geography and the British Geological Survey to develop computational models of coastal\\n erosion using IoT smart sensor data; with the Institute of Criminal Policy Research (funded by\\n the Dawes Trust) to investigate user signals in social media communications for evidence-\\n gathering in criminal prosecutions; and with a market branding company to develop an NLP\\n system for matching journalistic articles and Twitter data.\\n Over the next five years BIDA will:\\n       – develop data-driven methodologies to address big data and scalability challenges arising\\n         in the sciences;\\n       – collaborate with researchers in social sciences, arts and humanities to exploit the\\n         potential of advances in text mining, data curation and user modelling;\\n                                                                                               Page 4\\n\\n\\n       – spearhead public debate on ethics and emerging technologies such as video surveillance,\\n         user profiling and AI in general.\\n BKL strategy. BKL research has focused on the challenges of designing software to support\\n users’ knowledge creation processes. We have forged new collaborations with the British\\n Library, British Museum, and educationalists from several European universities and secured\\n joint funding leading to intelligent tools to support exploratory learning (EU), a specialist\\n knowledge base to support museology scholars’ research (AHRC), and further development\\n of the Samtla statistical language modelling software for searching digital archives (Wellcome\\n Trust ISSF) – ranked second in the 2018 British Library Labs Competition.\\n Over the next five years BKL will:\\n       – apply cutting-edge computer science to co-design tools that support domain experts in\\n         data integration, analysis and visualisation and in creating and sharing knowledge;\\n       – collaborate with educationalists, psychologists and practitioners to exploit the potential\\n         of AI in providing personalised support for learners and tutors in open-ended learning\\n         settings.\\n 1.3 Impact strategy\\n Review of REF2014 impact strategy. As stated in our REF2014 impact narrative, we have\\n encouraged “collaborative research carried out by multidisciplinary teams involving user\\n stakeholders” (cf. Impact Case Roussos-LondonAmbulance), promoted “links with industry\\n partners with whom we can develop research exploitation routes” (cf. Case Study\\n Kontchakov-VKG), engaged “with commercial, educational and policy organisations in\\n knowledge transfer activities” (cf. Case Study Roussos-ITU), and maintained “department-\\n industry networks through our part-time postgraduates and alumni”.\\n Post-REF2014 strategy. Following REF2014, the Department reassessed its approach to\\n generating impact and put in place additional initiatives and structures to enhance it. Our\\n approach is based on five key principles, which will continue to drive our strategy over the\\n next five years:\\n  (I1) Embed impact within our strategic research directions and research processes.\\n        For example, EDS employs an experimental systems approach leading to the\\n        development of novel software in healthcare and smart cities (cf. Case Studies\\n        Roussos-LondonAmbulance, Roussos-ITU). KRDM develops data management\\n        theories and technologies working with end-users in industry (cf. Case Study\\n        Kontchakov-VKG).\\n  (I2) Develop impact-generating activities through interdisciplinary and industrial\\n        collaborations (see Sec. 4).\\n  (I3) Recognise the importance of impact in our recruitment strategy by hiring staff with\\n        world-leading research developed collaboratively with industrial users.\\n  (I4) Leverage our unique relationship with research students: due to Birkbeck’s distinctive\\n        mission, we are uniquely positioned to collaboratively address economic and societal\\n        challenges identified by our students, the majority of whom pursue research concurrently\\n        with their professional careers.\\n        For example, our work on intelligent tools for ambulance routing (Case Study Roussos-\\n        LondonAmbulance) drew on the experience of part-time PhD student Marcus Poulton at\\n        the London Ambulance Service; and our collaboration with Neo4j on advanced querying\\n                                                                                                 Page 5\\n\\n\\n        methods for graph databases was facilitated by Petra Selmer, who completed her PhD\\n        part-time at Birkbeck while working for Neo4j.\\n   (I5) Communicate the outcomes of our research through a full breadth of non-academic\\n        routes, both digital and in-person.\\n These initiatives are supported by structures and measures including:\\n  –   Department’s Academic Lead for Impact, who promotes and monitors the implementation\\n      of impact strategy and achievement of impact, and ensures that impacts are recorded and\\n      communicated, building a knowledge base of external stakeholders and partners to inform\\n      future planning.\\n  –   Department’s Industry Advisory Board (IAB), comprising senior IT professionals from\\n      UK/global corporations in sectors such as innovation, consultancy, web/mobile technologies,\\n      ed-tech, energy, telecommunications. IAB members advise on all aspects of research to\\n      ensure relevance to economic and societal challenges, and serve as mentors supporting the\\n      development of collaborative activities as per (I2).\\n  –   School’s Research Impact Officer (RIO), a full-time role in BEI with the remit of\\n      evaluating and enhancing impact, working closely with other professional staff of the\\n      School and College (public engagement, research development and support, alumni,\\n      business services, communications). When new staff join the Department they meet with\\n      the RIO to discuss the impact potential of their research. Staff preparing research funding\\n      proposals consult with the RIO to ensure that impact is fully developed and embedded.\\n      The RIO meets regularly with the department’s Academic Lead for Impact and the RIOs\\n      of other Schools, allowing us to benefit from and inform best practice and wider impact\\n      strategy across the College.\\n  –   School and College Impact funding, available to amplify the impact of ongoing\\n      research (see 3.1).\\n  Areas of impact. Following this approach, we have substantially increased our impact on the\\n  IT, healthcare, culture and urban development sectors, as well as now impacting on digital\\n  humanities, cyber security and linked data management (see 4.2).\\n 1.4 Research integrity and open research environment.\\n The Department is committed to professionalism, openness, exercise of independent thought\\n and application of ethical principles, aligning with Birkbeck’s Research Integrity and Open\\n Research Data policies and concordats.\\n BIDA leads Birkbeck’s research on ethical issues in emerging technologies, and is the public\\n face of the College in the debate on the deployment of AI in our societies. All staff and research\\n students undertake mandatory ethics training before commencing their research at Birkbeck.\\n We operate a rigorous process for reviewing the ethical aspects of research involving human\\n participants, proposed by staff or students. The review is coordinated by the Department’s\\n Research Ethics Officer (REO) who passes non-routine cases to the School or College Ethics\\n Committee. The REO works with researchers to incorporate additional safeguards if required.\\n The REO serves on the School Ethics Committee, which has oversight of all ethical reviews in\\n the School and runs regular workshops to ensure that researchers are fully apprised of the\\n College’s principles and policies on research ethics and research integrity. Departmental REOs\\n undertake mandatory training before being appointed.\\n Our department’s PhD students played an active role in organising the Bloomsbury colleges’\\n “Love Data Week” for research students in 2018 and 2020, discussing research data\\n                                                                                               Page 6\\n\\n\\n management and ethics.\\n Wherever possible we encourage staff to publish open-access, if necessary supplementing\\n funding available for this from the College. All articles accepted for publication are deposited in\\n open access form (Green or Gold) in the Birkbeck institutional repository BIROn. We extensively\\n use open publishing services such as arXiv (260+ papers since REF2014).\\n We use github, dedicated Web pages and the Birkbeck Data Repository BiRD to make all\\n software and data produced by our research freely available, compliant with regulatory\\n frameworks and data protection legislation. For example, the code for the Virtual Knowledge\\n Graph system Ontop is available at https://github.com/ontop/ontop and for the Parkinson’s PDkit\\n at https://github.com/pdkit/pdkit, the ontology developed by the Weaving Communities of\\n Practice project at https://www2.bbk.ac.uk/weavingcommunities/Ontology/, the Mapping\\n Museums data and software at http://museweb.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/data and\\n https://github.com/MappingMuseums/MMWebApp.\\n 2. People\\n 2.1 Staffing Strategy and Staff Development\\n Mentoring, Probation, Appraisal. Academic and research staff are assigned to one of the\\n research Groups as their primary affiliation, providing peer support alongside a research Mentor\\n who advises on research career development, training, funding applications and forging\\n collaborations with other institutions/disciplines. Staff meet as required, but at least annually,\\n with their Mentor.\\n Probationary staff meet annually with their Probationary Advisor to review all aspects of their\\n work. Post-probation academic staff undertake an annual Academic Review with a senior\\n colleague appointed by the HoD (Levene) to discuss achievements in the previous year,\\n objectives for the coming year, career aspirations, promotion planning, balance of work, and any\\n obstacles to progress in research, teaching or academic management. Research staff undertake\\n a similar review, tailored towards their career stage.\\n Training. The Department’s staff undertake College training in diversity and equality,\\n unconscious bias, recruitment, line management, research supervision (for both new and\\n experienced supervisors), promotion, data protection, writing grant proposals, project\\n management, open access, public engagement and knowledge exchange, aligned with the\\n relevant policies and concordats. This provides a structure supporting the more informal\\n coaching through mentorship within the Department.\\n Staff undertake training organised by the School in publishing research, generating impact,\\n research integrity and ethics, using audio-visual media for research communication (supported\\n by the BEI Film Unit and the Derek Jarman Lab), and applying for research funding – including\\n events where senior officers from specific funding bodies are invited to speak directly to staff.\\n The Department’s Knowledge Exchange champion organises regular training in\\n commercialisation, delivered by external experts. New staff attend innovation and\\n entrepreneurship training delivered by UCL Enterprise.\\n Workload allocation. Academic staff have a standard annual teaching load determining the\\n amount of lecture/lab-based teaching, tutoring and BSc/MSc project supervision. Allocation of\\n teaching duties is undertaken by the HoD in discussion with the individuals and the Directors of\\n Studies. Management duties are also shared evenly, fostering academics’ engagement in College,\\n School and Departmental processes. Most are rotated every three years and, as with teaching,\\n individuals discuss their preferences with the HoD. There are reductions for ECRs (see below).\\n                                                                                                 Page 7\\n\\n\\n To promote transparency, everyone’s duties are published annually on the departmental intranet.\\n Research Grants, Impact. The School’s Research Development Officer assists staff in\\n developing new research collaborations and proposals, and oversees a formal peer review\\n process for all funding proposals. The School’s Research Impact Officer assists staff in\\n developing impact from their research (see 1.3). The Department’s academic lead for impact\\n (Zakharyaschev) and Knowledge Exchange champion (Roussos) work with individuals and the\\n Research and Impact Officers, articulating with the School’s and College’s training and support\\n mechanisms.\\n The College’s Research Office provides support for submitting proposals and communicating\\n with external funders. It advises on IP protection and exploitation, supported with specialist Tech\\n Transfer expertise from UCL Business.\\n The School provides funding for pump-priming the research of new staff and new collaborations\\n (School Research Fund) and for supporting staff in developing impact from their research\\n (School Impact Fund). Applications can be made several times each year and are assessed\\n according to quality and strategic importance by the School’s Executive Board. Academic staff\\n can additionally apply to College funding calls e.g. College Impact Seed Fund, Wellcome Trust\\n ISSF.\\n Sabbaticals. Academic staff (including fixed- and part-time) can take one term in ten as a\\n Research or Impact sabbatical. They are required to report back on how they have used this\\n leave and the outcomes achieved.\\n ECRs. The teaching duties of ECRs are kept below the departmental average, starting at a half\\n load and increasing gradually to a full load by the third year. ECRs have a lighter management\\n load throughout their first three years, taking on roles with coordination and decision-making\\n responsibilities appropriate for their career stage. Research Mentors, the Director of Research\\n and HoD provide guidance on all aspects of research.\\n The effectiveness of our support of ECRs is evidenced by the promotion during this census\\n period of seven lecturers to SL and two to Reader.\\n PDRAs contribute to the Department’s vitality through activities such as helping to organise\\n conferences/workshops/seminars, running stakeholder events, producing research\\n software/datasets, preparing online research-related content, presenting at conferences, and\\n undertaking research-related visits. They are offered opportunities to guest lecture on taught\\n modules, supported by their line manager and the Department’s Teaching Tutor.\\n The effectiveness of our support for PDRAs is exemplified by the career trajectories of two\\n colleagues who joined as PDRAs and were then successful in being appointed to a Lectureship,\\n with subsequent promotion of one to SL and one to Reader. Three other PDRAs have\\n progressed to Lecturer/SL positions at other HEIs during this census period; four have\\n progressed to senior R&D posts in industry.\\n Staffing and recruitment. The College’s recruitment strategy focusses on appointing mainly\\n at Lecturer level. The new academics we appointed since REF2014 (see below) are\\n demonstrably meeting our research and impact strategy principles R1, R4, R6, I1-I3, as\\n evidenced by their research expertise, publications quality, extensive collaborations and\\n impact. Most academic posts are open-ended although on occasion there are fixed-term\\n posts associated with specific initiatives; to date, all our fixed-term post-holders have been\\n transferred to open-ended contracts towards the end of probation.\\n Since REF2014 we have appointed 8 Lecturers (4 early-career), one SL, one Reader (four\\n                                                                                                Page 8\\n\\n\\n are BAME, all are male, women were shortlisted for seven of the posts).\\n The Department grew by 30% over this census period and now comprises 8 Professors, 3\\n Readers, 7 SLs and 8 Lecturers, showing an even balance between senior and junior grades.\\n In recognition of the strength of our strategy, the College has announced three more posts for\\n 2021: one Professor, two SL/Readers. We are actively addressing gender imbalance through\\n the measures outlined in 2.3.\\n A steady rate of staff promotions facilitates succession planning as more senior management\\n roles (including research leadership roles) can be prepared for through discussions, facilitated\\n by the HoD, between current holders and staff seeking promotion, and handed over after\\n promotion. Female staff benefit from the College’s Aurora Leadership programme.\\n Space. The Department works with College Estates to provision high-quality premises for\\n researchers. Full-time academics are allocated their own office. Part-time academics,\\n research staff, and full-time research students are assigned their own desk and PC in a\\n shared office/lab. Part-time research students are assigned a shared desk and PC. There are\\n three dedicated Research Seminar and Meeting rooms, and additional ones bookable\\n throughout the School. The department’s labs have ample capacity to be booked for user\\n design/evaluation workshops and community engagement/dissemination events. Additional\\n study and social space is available in the BEI Graduate Centre.\\n Recognition of research and impact. Appointment, promotion and remuneration processes\\n recognise all aspects of research, including outputs, grants, supervision, public engagement,\\n knowledge exchange, impact, community service. To reward successful grant applications, a\\n small proportion of the grant overheads allocated to the Department is available to the award\\n holder(s) to fund research-related expenses. Research achievements are publicised on the\\n Department’s website, ensuring visibility, providing inspiration for early-career researchers, and\\n creating a benchmark for expected levels of activity.\\n Research Exchanges. The Department provides generous financial support for conference\\n attendance and research-related visits: see 3.1,4.1.\\n Retention. We have high academic staff retention, with just three leavers in this census period.\\n Implementation of the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. As\\n detailed above and in 2.2 and 2.3, we espouse the three Principles of the 2019 Concordat by\\n providing a supportive and inclusive working environment, recognising and valuing all\\n researchers’ contributions, and fostering researchers’ professional and career development. Our\\n provisions are under continual review by the Department’s management and research\\n committees.\\n 2.2 Research Students\\n Recruitment. The Department’s research student recruitment strategy leverages our research\\n reputation to attract strong applicants. Aligning with Birkbeck’s mission, the majority enrol for\\n part-time study and have significant other commitments. Student recruitment levels rose in the\\n latter part of the previous census period and have been maintained throughout this period, with\\n 45 students enrolled during 2019/20 (62% PT, 38% FT). We recruit applicants from diverse\\n backgrounds, as evidenced by our current research student demographics: 40% BAME, 40%\\n non-British, 25% female, 12% registered disabled. Staff involved in research student recruitment\\n are required to have undertaken recruitment training.\\n Research Studentships. The Department has funded 14 PhD studentships in this census\\n period, awarded to exceptional part-time or full-time applicants. Additionally, 2 students have\\n                                                                                                Page 9\\n\\n\\n been funded by College interdisciplinary studentships, awarded from time to time through\\n institution-wide competition. Birkbeck staff can also apply for collaborative PhD studentships in\\n the annual Bloomsbury Consortium PhD Studentships competition: we have been successful in\\n 4 such bids in this period, two in collaboration with UCL IoE and two with LSHTM.\\n The Department also has 4 Graduate Teaching Assistant posts whose holders complete a PhD\\n over four years, with full fee remission, while contributing to the department’s teaching and\\n enhancing their transferable skills.\\n Support and Monitoring. We implement, and in some areas go beyond, the College’s Code of\\n Practice for Postgraduate Training and Research. Each student is assigned one or two primary\\n supervisors with expertise in their research area, and a secondary supervisor for a broader\\n perspective. Less experienced supervisors are teamed with staff who have strong supervisory\\n track records. Female students may request that one of their supervisors is female. Full-time\\n students meet weekly with their supervisors, part-time students every fortnight. The Research\\n Tutor oversees students’ well-being, induction and training, organises termly meetings with all\\n students and an annual survey. Three seminar series, specialist discussion/reading groups,\\n research group/centre meetings and annual Research Days provide students with a range of\\n opportunities to integrate into the research life of the department and present their work in\\n informal settings.\\n We make special efforts to create opportunities for part-time students to meet with staff and\\n other students. All training events for research students are held in late afternoon/evening.\\n A subcommittee of the Department’s Research Committee monitors students’ progression,\\n training needs, transfer to PhD, and completion. Students submit written reports annually and\\n give oral presentations at key stages.\\n There has been a 10% increase in the number of PhDs awarded in this census period compared\\n to the last. In the Department’s last research student survey, 90% stated they were satisfied with\\n their supervision and 88% with the progression processes.\\n Skills Development. All students attend the Department’s Research Methods training and\\n generic skills training organised by Birkbeck’s Graduate Research School and the Bloomsbury\\n Postgraduate Skills Network. Most College training courses for staff are also open to research\\n students.\\n The Department funds students’ presentation of papers at conferences – at least one paper per\\n year, for both PT and FT students.\\n Research students are offered opportunities to provide teaching assistance on our taught\\n programmes and receive training for this organised by the College and support from the\\n Teaching Tutor.\\n The effectiveness of our research student support and training is evidenced by the career\\n trajectories of our PhD graduates, e.g. in this census period five attained Lecturer positions at\\n HEIs, two exploited their doctoral research to co-found new start-ups, and four were appointed\\n to R&D posts in areas such as medical informatics, data science and software services.\\n 2.3 Equality and Diversity\\n Strategy to support equality and diversity\\n For all posts we encourage applicants with diverse backgrounds, as evidenced by our current\\n staff demographics: 6 academic/research staff are BAME, the majority are of non-British origin,\\n two are women. For new female academic/research staff, we ensure that at least one of their\\n Probationary Advisor or Mentor is a woman.\\n                                                                                              Page 10\\n\\n\\n All categories of staff are required to undertake Equality & Diversity and Unconscious Bias\\n training, and to repeat this every three years. Staff involved in recruitment are required to have\\n undertaken recruitment training, which includes an equalities component. Staff recruitment\\n panels contain at least one woman.\\n The HoD supports staff preparing to apply for promotion, accelerated increments and\\n performance-related payments, which are open to all staff categories. Staff are also\\n encouraged to attend the College’s workshops on applying for promotion.\\n A positive review of promotions is undertaken annually by a panel comprising the HoD and\\n senior professors (4 men,1 woman) to identify staff to encourage to apply. Mentors and academic\\n reviewers also play a proactive role in this respect.\\n The Department engages with the College’s and School’s equality and diversity initiatives and\\n with the Action Plan of the HR Excellence in Research Award, working with the School’s\\n Assistant Dean for Equality & Diversity to embed these in all its processes.\\n We have a staunch commitment to Athena SWAN: Poulovassilis was a member of the College’s\\n Athena SWAN Committee from its inception till 2017 and participated in the successful\\n application for Bronze in 2016. Roussos led the Department’s Athena SWAN Self-Assessment\\n Team preparing the successful application for Bronze in 2017. Poulovassilis is a Mentor in the\\n Aurora Leadership Programme. Our annual Andrew & Kathleen Booth lecture attracts leading\\n innovators and alternates a female and male distinguished speaker each year.\\n The Department’s staffing capacity enables sabbatical leave to be accommodated as part of\\n normal workload planning. All staff categories are entitled to parental/caring leave according to\\n College policies, and their duties are covered by recruiting additional staff for a fixed period.\\n Due in part to Birkbeck’s teaching being largely in the evening, the Department has a\\n longstanding culture where flexible working is the norm for all staff. Options include\\n homeworking, staggered hours/flexi-time, part-time and job-share. Evening teaching for\\n academic staff does not exceed 3 evenings per week and is balanced by late morning starts.\\n Remote working (including remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic) is enabled by\\n extensive IT infrastructure allowing remote access to all resources. Staff and students are also\\n supported through licensing software and loaning hardware for home use.\\n In the last Departmental survey, 96% and 88% of staff endorsed the Department’s flexible\\n working and family support, respectively. In the last College survey, 89% of the Department’s\\n staff agreed that they work in an inclusive and enabling environment promoting tolerance and\\n freedom from discrimination.\\n Career pathways. Part-time staff have the same opportunities and entitlements as full-time, with\\n pro-rata allocation of work duties. Fixed-term staff have the same opportunities and entitlements\\n as those on open-ended contracts. Announcements of job openings are regularly emailed by\\n HR. PDRAs approaching the end of their contract meet with their line manager to discuss\\n continuing work opportunities. Bridging funding is available for PDRAs between contracts.\\n Research Leadership roles. The Director of Research (Zakharyaschev), Director of BIDA\\n (Provetti) and Director of BKL (Poulovassilis) are appointed by the HoD in consultation with the\\n Dean and senior staff. Research Group directors are appointed by the HoD in consultation with\\n the Director of Research and Group members. The departmental Research Committee is\\n chaired by the Director of Research. Its core members include the Research Tutor, Group and\\n Centre directors, and elected representatives of the research staff and students. However, all\\n                                                                                                Page 11\\n\\n\\n are encouraged to attend its meetings and participate in the formulation of research and impact\\n strategy, and the setting and monitoring of objectives.\\n Access to funding. All academic and research staff and students can apply to the Department\\n for funding to attend conferences, undertake research-related visits, attend training courses, and\\n organise stakeholder workshops and dissemination events. All staff have access to the same\\n support mechanisms in preparing applications for School, College and external funding (see\\n 2.1).\\n Returning from leave and changing circumstances. Our flexible working provisions enable\\n staff to manage transitions after returning from periods of parental leave or ill health, changes in\\n their health or caring responsibilities, and switching between full- and part-time working. Staff\\n returning from leave may request flexible working or a variation in their contract (including\\n homeworking, staggered hours/flexi-time, part-time, job-share). Changes to working\\n arrangements are managed flexibly between the individual and their line manager. Research\\n students can similarly switch between full- and part-time study and can request breaks-in-study\\n to accommodate changes in their professional or personal circumstances.\\n Routine planning for periods of maternity, paternity, shared parental and adoption leave includes\\n a detailed leave planner and planning for Keeping in Touch (KIT) days. Staff on\\n maternity/adoption leave can take up to ten paid KIT days. Upon return to work, staff are\\n supported with childcare costs through Birkbeck’s childcare vouchers scheme. Returning staff\\n and students have access to the College’s nursery, which operates 5.30-9pm when most\\n teaching and supervision takes place.\\n Support for those with disabilities. The Department’s Disability Officer liaises with the\\n College’s Disability support services to ensure that support plans are collaboratively formulated\\n with staff and students to enable them to work and study effectively. This includes access to\\n disability allowances and learning support funds, provisioning of assistive technologies, and\\n adjustments to working environments, work duties and required presence in College. The\\n Disability Officer is a member of the School’s Disability Working Group.\\n Wellbeing of staff and students. The HoD operates an open-door policy as do all academic\\n and professional staff (virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic). The Department has a code of\\n practice governing responsiveness to emails and requests for meetings. So staff and students\\n are easily able to obtain advice on College, School and Departmental policies, support\\n mechanisms and resources.\\n We place strong emphasis on integration and communication across the department. This is\\n ensured through regular research group/centre meetings, three seminar series, training events\\n for staff and students, and a monthly departmental “Merienda” where we celebrate the past\\n month’s achievements. There are two annual social events, the Christmas party and the Away\\n Day in September. In the last College survey, 88% of the Department’s staff agreed that Birkbeck\\n is a good place to work.\\n Consideration of Equality and Diversity in construction of REF submission. Our\\n departmental REF preparation team (3 men, 1 woman) read and recommended outputs and\\n impact case studies for our UoA. The selection of outputs and impact case studies was\\n undertaken by a School-level panel chaired by the Dean and including the School’s three UoA\\n leads, Deputy Dean, Assistant Dean for Research and one external expert (5 men, 2 women).\\n The College’s code of practice was followed throughout, including a three-round process for\\n outputs selection. After each round the College undertook an analysis of the distribution of\\n outputs across staff with respect to multiple protected characteristics and no statistically\\n significant imbalances were found for our UoA.\\n                                                                                               Page 12\\n\\n\\n 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n Our 30% growth in staff since REF2014 has been accompanied by a strategic aim to increase\\n research resources in terms of income (both external and internal), office and lab space, and\\n high-performance computing. It is to be noted that we undertake significant amounts of\\n fundamental research for which additional external funding is not required.\\n 3.1 Research funding\\n The Department has three main sources of income to support its research strategy: (i) external\\n funding from research councils, foundations and trusts; (ii) internal funding from the School and\\n College; (iii) OfS through our IoC participation.\\n External grants. External awards have grown by 50% from £1.6M in the previous REF period to\\n £2.4M in the current period. Major awards include:\\n     –   KRDM: the EPSRC LIQUID grant on data integration (£89K) and the EPSRC iTract and\\n         quadMD grants on OBDA (£354K, £453K), leading to impact case study Kontchakov-VKG\\n         and major publications in JACM, AIJ, JAIR, LICS, PODS;\\n     –   EDS: an M.J.Fox Foundation grant to develop a data science toolbox for Parkinson’s\\n         disease (£114K), an Innovate UK grant to develop the cloudUPDRS app for Parkinson’s\\n         sufferers (£69K), and funding from the Bloomsbury Consortium and Wellcome Trust\\n         ISSF to investigate the IoT’s role in giving agency and voice to individuals and\\n         communities (£78K); leading also to publications in IEEE Access, J. Ambient Intelligence\\n         & Smart Environments, J. Pervasive Mobile Computing, PerCom, eHealth 360o ;\\n     –   AVS: three EPSRC grants on risk measurement (£101K), probabilistic verification\\n         (£100K), and stability in graphs (£152K), leading to publications in TCS, IJAR, J. Comb.,\\n         J. Comb. Theory, POPL;\\n     –   BIDA: UKRI GCRF Action Against Stunting Hub funding (£195K), developing data\\n         analysis techniques to investigate the causes of child stunting (still in early stages);\\n     –   BKL: EU iTalk2Learn project (£326K) on intelligent support for 5-11 year olds’ learning of\\n         maths, and AHRC Mapping Museums project (£215K) developing a specialist knowledge\\n         base for museology scholars and professionals; leading also to publications in ACM\\n         JoCCH, UMAP, EC-TEL, LAK.\\n Internal grants. In this census period we were awarded School funding of £110K for pump-\\n priming research projects, £83K for impact development (impact case studies Roussos-\\n LondonAmbulance and Roussos-ITU were supported by a series of such grants), £30K for\\n conference attendance, as well as £50K from the College’s ISSF, Impact Seed Fund and NYU\\n Collaboration Fund. The Department additionally provided £102K to staff and students attending\\n conferences and undertaking research-related visits. Thus, internal research funding amounts to\\n over £375K.\\n IoC grants. The IoC awarded us over £600K to develop new UG/PG programmes in Data\\n Science. This was a significant boost to our Data Science and Algorithms research as it funded\\n 50% of three new academic posts. A PGCert was developed with the British Library and\\n National Archives to provide digital skills training for their staff, building on and extending our\\n research collaborations in the Samtla project. We secured additional OfS funding of £100K to\\n develop a new PGCert in Applied Data Science, funding 50% of a further post. The IoC funds\\n also Birkbeck’s IoC Manager who contributes to Samtla and NLP research at the BKL. IoC\\n membership also enhances our environment through initiatives to widen participation in under-\\n                                                                                                 Page 13\\n\\n\\n represented groups; for example, we were awarded £120K in scholarships funding for women\\n and black students on the new PGCert.\\n Future funding. Continuing to increase external funding, from a broad range of sources, is a\\n key aim. We are currently preparing 7 proposals for EPSRC funding, 2 BBSRC/MRC proposals\\n in life sciences informatics, 2 AHRC/ESRC proposals in digital humanities and museum data\\n analytics, and 4 InnovateUK proposals in healthcare data analytics, blockchain analytics,\\n construction sensor data analysis, and computational journalism. Two proposals (EPSRC,\\n AHRC, £500K) have already been funded in 2021.\\n 3.2 Research infrastructure\\n The Department works with the College’s Estates, ITS and Library to ensure provision of high-\\n quality space, general IT and learning resources for its researchers.\\n BIDA’s foundation was in part a response to the REF2014 outcomes which recommended that\\n the College invest more in interdisciplinary research and the research environment. BIDA is\\n physically distributed across labs/offices of the participating Schools. Due to its research reach\\n and the strategic significance it has established, the College is currently elevating BIDA to\\n become one of Birkbeck’s eight Research Institutes, which will lead to increased college funding,\\n support, and collaboration opportunities.\\n Since its launch in 2016, BKL has been housed in a purpose-built lab for 20+ researchers and\\n its membership has expanded to include researchers from Birkbeck’s departments of\\n Psychology, History of Art and Cultures & Languages.\\n Computing facilities. The Department provides the hardware, software and technical training\\n required by all staff and students to undertake their research. In addition to equipment\\n purchased for specific projects, we have a SLURM GPU cluster with 12xP100 and 16xGTX1080i\\n GPUs. Virtual machines for R&D are provisioned on our Xen hypervisor pool (16 servers, 480\\n physical cores, 2.8TB RAM). We also have a Rocks cluster of six compute nodes and two\\n further general-purpose computing servers (AMD EPYC). For storage we use two Read\\n Intensive RAID arrays (2x9TB PCIe SSD) and a dedicated storage server (Open-E DSS) with\\n 22TB SSD disk. Inter-host networks are 10Gbps or faster. Our teaching labs can be booked for\\n user and community engagement events; when they are not in use we re-utilise the machines\\n for research as a HTCondor pool with 1248 compute slots and 2TB RAM. Since REF2014 we\\n have doubled our average spend on research computing to £40K per annum.\\n Research Support Staff. The department’s research is supported by two Systems and one\\n Administrative staff FTEs. In addition, three School staff FTEs – the Research Development,\\n Impact, and Finance Officers – manage the School’s research processes and support\\n departments’ research development and exploitation. The School’s Communication Officer and\\n Event Officer support our research communication activities. Additional expertise and support is\\n provided by the Department’s academic lead for impact and Knowledge Exchange champion,\\n the Research Office, and UCL Business (see 2.1).\\n 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society\\n To achieve our strategic aims we collaborate with leading computer scientists, researchers from\\n other disciplines, and user stakeholders beyond academia. In particular, we\\n      –   promote collaboration by inviting leading researchers to visit Birkbeck and supporting\\n          visits in the other direction;\\n                                                                                               Page 14\\n\\n\\n      –   encourage and support staff in initiating joint projects with other university and industrial\\n          partners, including multi- and interdisciplinary research;\\n      –   promote knowledge exchange, public engagement and impact by organising stakeholder\\n          workshops and dissemination events.\\n 4.1 Research collaboration\\n The Department runs weekly seminars where leading scholars from the UK, Europe and beyond\\n present their research to staff and students. Approximately 100 seminars took place over this\\n census period, often combined with additional activities within specific research groups. BIDA\\n and BKL run additional interdisciplinary seminar series, with approximately 50 events during this\\n period.\\n 50+ researchers visited us during this period from universities in 18 countries, while staff\\n undertook 100+ visits to universities/organisations in 21 countries. The Department contributed\\n to funding longer-term visits of 20+ researchers from other universities/organisations to Birkbeck\\n and 35+ such visits in the opposite direction.\\n We have held Visiting Professorships at the Northwestern Polytechnical University, China, and\\n University of Technology, Australia (Maybank); Bar-Ilan University (Levene); KAIST and\\n University of Sydney (Yoo); Higher School of Economics, Russia (Zakharyaschev). Zhang is\\n currently on a two-year leave of absence as Staff Research Scientist at Blue Prism AI Labs\\n exploiting his expertise in machine learning.\\n Articles published since 2014 have co-authors from 80+ universities in 30+ countries, making\\n our research truly international. We have co-authors from 35+ companies including Alibaba,\\n BNY Mellon, BT, IBM, Microsoft, Neo4j, Paddy Power, Samsung, Siemens, Telefonica Digital.\\n Most of our funded research projects are in collaboration with colleagues from other universities\\n in the UK and internationally, many from other disciplines, and with other stakeholders. For\\n example,\\n      –   in KRDM, the OBDA projects are joint with the universities of Liverpool, Bozen-Bolzano\\n          and Sassari, and with Siemens (Germany), Sirius (Norway), Siris Academic (Spain), and\\n          the Pilsudski Institute of America;\\n      –   in EDS, one project is collaborative with University of the Arts, Proboscis and British\\n          Antarctic Survey; another is with UCL IoN, Benchmark Performance, Retechnica and\\n          Audience Focus;\\n      –   in BIDA, the new £19.76M UKRI GCRF project involves researchers from multiple\\n          science and social science disciplines affiliated with 18 institutions in the UK, India,\\n          Indonesia and Senegal;\\n      –   in BKL, the Mapping Museums project is collaborative with Birkbeck’s History of Art\\n          department and stakeholders from across the UK museum sector (including Arts Council\\n          England, DCMS and the Museums Development Network); the Samtla project with the\\n          British Library, Wellcome Trust, and SOAS; and the iTalk2Learn project with\\n          educationalists from several European universities.\\n We frequently supervise students jointly with other departments and Bloomsbury Consortium\\n Institutions: in this census period two students with Psychology (one MRC-funded, one College-\\n funded), a College-funded student with Biology, and four Bloomsbury Consortium-funded\\n students – two with UCL IoE, two with LSHTM.\\n                                                                                                 Page 15\\n\\n\\n In addition to BIDA and BKL, staff are members of several other research centres, including the\\n Centre for Cognition, Computation & Modelling, Centre for Innovation Management Research,\\n Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, and Centre for Educational Neuroscience.\\n 4.2 Impact beyond academia\\n Through implementation of our post-REF2014 impact strategy, our network of research users\\n and beneficiaries has expanded substantially during the census period:\\n     –    In Healthcare, EDS has pioneered research into data-driven techniques to reduce\\n          ambulance arrival times, incorporated into decision support tools deployed by the London\\n          Ambulance Service (Impact Case Study Roussos-LondonAmbulance). In collaboration\\n          with clinical and commercial partners, we developed cloudUPDRS, the first smartphone\\n          app certified as a Class I medical device by the Medicines and Healthcare Products\\n          Regulatory Agency for assessing the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. We are\\n          developing a secure platform for healthcare data analytics with Cambridge Medical\\n          Academy.\\n     –    In Information technology, KRDM has made significant contributions to the\\n          development of theory, practice and tools for OBDA, collaborating in the development of\\n          the Ontop platform with start-up Ontopic (Italy) and other partners as listed in 4.1 (Impact\\n          Case Study Kontchakov-VKG). We have secured funding from the European Space\\n          Agency to develop conceptual modelling-based techniques for data exchange between\\n          ESA and their suppliers of satellite and rocket technology.\\n     –    In Smart cities, Roussos is Associate Rapporteur of Study Group 20 of the International\\n          Telecommunications Union (ITU), developing standards in service interoperability and\\n          big data analytics for smart cities. He has led research into integrating diverse\\n          technologies into a comprehensive system of smart city universal entity identification,\\n          ratified as ITU Recommendation Y.4805 and providing a blueprint for smart cities in China\\n          and several African countries (Impact Case Study Roussos-ITU).\\n     –    In Cyber security, we have developed a data-driven cyber-intrusion detection platform in\\n          collaboration with KAIST, used at Samsung and BT. We are working with Samsung on\\n          next-generation monitoring and protection systems for IoT-enabled devices, and with a\\n          market-leading blockchain technology company on identifying abnormalities in\\n          blockchain data.\\n     –    In Linked Data standardisation, Hidders co-leads the Property-Graph Schema Working\\n          Group of the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC). He is coordinating researchers\\n          and companies such as Neo4j, Amazon Neptune and Google to standardise the\\n          Property-Graph data model as LDBC’s representative on the international SQL Standard\\n          committee (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG3). The PGSWG is developing the GQL query\\n          language for graph data, to be incorporated also into SQL.\\n     –    In Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage, the Samtla software has been deployed\\n          over the British Library historical text archive and Wellcome Trust Medical Library. UK\\n          museum organisations are using the Mapping Museums knowledge base to understand\\n          the current state of the sector. We are working with leading science museums including\\n          the Science Museum, London, and the Exploratorium, San Francisco, to develop\\n          audience research methods incorporating high-precision indoor location sensing and\\n          spatial analytics.\\n                                                                                                Page 16\\n\\n\\n As shown by the above, our research focuses on timely technological and societal problems.\\n Most recently, the Covid-19 emergency led several staff to initiate projects aimed at\\n understanding and mitigating the effects of the pandemic: Poulovassilis obtained collaborative\\n funding with History of Art and Geography from the UKRI Covid-19 Rapid Response Call to\\n investigate the resilience of UK museums during the crisis; Levene and Weston are collaborating\\n with doctors from two London hospitals to develop a machine learning model for diagnosing\\n Covid-19 from patients’ medical social media posts; Provetti is collaborating with Philosophy to\\n explore privacy issues arising from Covid-tracking apps.\\n 4.3 Wider influence\\n We have served on the Editorial Boards of 30+ journals, including Artificial Intelligence, ACM\\n ToCL, J.

Unit context and structure\\n This UOA submission includes the Department of Computer Science, the Department of Applied\\n Mathematics and the Department of Built Environment. The UOA research is structured into two\\n research Centres:\\n \\uf0b7   PROTECT - Centre for Critical Infrastructure Computer Technology & Protection (led by Shi)\\n     The research in PROTECT focuses on trustworthy computer technology for the functional\\n     enrichment and security protection of computing systems. The Centre comprises five\\n     research groups: Networking & Distributed Systems, Network & Information Security, e-\\n     Health Systems, Applied Computing, and Computer Games.\\n \\uf0b7   DSRC - Data Science Research Centre (led by Lisboa)\\n     The work in DSRC advances mathematical methodology and applications. The methodology\\n     focuses on the interpretation of machine learning models including interpretation by design.\\n     Applications cover specialist expertise in medical imaging, cancer research and\\n     mathematical biology, e.g., detection of glaucoma and NMR spectroscopy of brain tumours.\\n This UOA returns 42 FTE Category A staff, of which 31 FTEs are from the Department of\\n Computer Science, 10 FTEs from the Department of Applied Mathematics, and 1 FTE from the\\n Department of Built Environment. Each member of the staff can join more than one research\\n Centre or Group to facilitate cross-discipline research collaborations. Among the staff returned,\\n 26 are in PROTECT, 11 in DSRC, and 5 in both Centres. The Centres give the staff flexibility\\n and support to pursue their own research interests while promoting and fostering a collaborative\\n culture to jointly tackle multi/inter-disciplinary research challenges.\\n In the rest of this document, the common information between the Centres or Departments will\\n be presented at the UOA level without naming them, whereas details about a specific Centre or\\n Department will refer to that Centre or Department.\\n 1.2. Research strategy\\n 1.2.1. UOA aims and strategy for period 2014-2020\\n This UOA was guided by the University and Faculty strategies to deliver impactful research and\\n scholarship during this REF period. Specifically, the UOA aimed to develop collaborative and\\n targeted research of high quality, build critical mass in key existing research areas, and explore\\n emerging topics in the areas for income and impact generation. To achieve this aim, our strategy\\n was to consolidate and significantly expand our research base by nurturing existing academic\\n staff and recruiting research-excellent new staff to increase the quality, volume and impact of our\\n research. This strategy was implemented through the following mechanisms:\\n \\uf0b7   Encouragement and support for excellent research work enhanced through staff recruitment\\n     and aligned with high priority areas, e.g., those identified by the EPSRC and EU, and\\n     publishable in good journals and conferences,\\n \\uf0b7   Inclusion of more academic staff in collaborative high-quality research led by well-established\\n     research-active staff,\\n \\uf0b7   Provision of incentives and support for collaborative funding applications, enterprise activities\\n     and impact creation,\\n \\uf0b7   Promotion of external collaborations and public engagement to widen the scope and\\n     identification of research opportunities and dissemination pathways, and\\n \\uf0b7   Scholarly enrichment of our degree programmes and teaching to keep up with the\\n     development of technology.\\n Our research strategy, measures for its implementation and the progress made were reviewed\\n regularly to improve their suitability for the delivery of the UOA research aims. For instance,\\n                                                                                               Page 1\\n\\n\\n PROTECT successfully retained the Research Centre status following a biennial review by the\\n University Committee for Research and Knowledge Exchange in 02/2018.\\n 1.2.2. Review of the UOA’s REF2014 plan and progress for period 2014-2020\\n The research plan for 2014-2020 presented in our REF2014 submission consisted of two parts,\\n one for PROTECT and the other for Neural Computing Research Group (NCRG, expanded to\\n become DSRC in 09/2016). PROTECT aimed to research underlying scientific theories,\\n methods and mechanisms to support the development of trustworthy computing systems, which\\n resulted in a significant number of high quality publications (e.g., in IEEE Transactions). It also\\n planned to engage with users for impact generation, which led to wider realised impact from our\\n research as demonstrated in the UOA’s impact case studies (e.g., Smart Energy, Smart Care).\\n Regarding the plan to attract funding from sources like the EU and EPSRC, a large growth in the\\n amounts of funding awarded from these two bodies was achieved as detailed in Section 3.1.\\n NCRG maintained its focus on application-driven methodological research, particularly in the\\n interpretation of machine learning systems and its impact on application areas, detailed in\\n Section 1.2.4. This benefited from an increase in critical mass with the appointment of 5 new\\n staff (Ortega - formerly an EU Marie Curie Research Fellow here, Olier, Correa, Siekmann,\\n Czanner-G - formerly a scientist at Liverpool’s St Paul’s Eye Unit).\\n Further evidence of progress is highlighted by the following achievements:\\n \\uf0b7   Greatly increased REF-able staff: 42 staff including 24 recruited during this REF period are\\n     returned in this UOA, representing an increase of 320% over 10 staff for REF2014, which\\n     provides critical mass for the research areas covered by the UOA. The increase is the result\\n     of fulfilling the University strategy for the significant growth of both excellence and volume in\\n     impactful research as well as a consequence of an altered framework for REF2021.\\n \\uf0b7   Significantly increased research outputs in high-quality journals: 105 peer-reviewed outputs\\n     are included in this UOA submission, while only 34 outputs were submitted to REF2014. 104\\n     out of the 105 outputs are published in journals with the remaining one presented at a top\\n     conference (ACM-SIAM SODA), which shows a slight increase of the journal percentage\\n     from 97% for REF2014 to 99% for the current submission. The average impact factor of the\\n     journals publishing these 104 outputs is 4.76 that is 28% higher than 3.73 for REF2014.\\n     Here, the impact factors were checked using the 2019 Journal Citation Reports published by\\n     Clarivate Analytics, five of our REF2021 journal outputs were excluded from the calculation\\n     as their related journals (i.e., IEEE TCSS, IEEE T-SUSC and IEEE TETCI) started publishing\\n     recently with no impact factors available, and also one of our REF2014 journal outputs had\\n     no impact factor. The new average of impact factors indicates that the significant increase of\\n     our output quantity is achieved with an increase in quality.\\n \\uf0b7   Strong research income growth: £4.4m was generated from funding sources such as EPSRC\\n     and the EU during this REF period, rising by 300% over £1.1m for REF2014, which was\\n     boosted by the considerable expansion of the UOA staff base.\\n \\uf0b7   Increased PhD awards: 71.5 PhD completions are reported in this UOA submission,\\n     showing an increase of 218% over 22.5 for REF2014, which is partly due to our Faculty and\\n     University investment in 60 PhD studentships to attract bright students for research.\\n \\uf0b7   Continued investment in research facilities: £1.1m was spent on the improvement and\\n     expansion of research facilities for the UOA research during this REF period, rising by 59%\\n     compared to REF2014.\\n The above facts point to an accelerated growth of the UOA research achievements since\\n REF2014, thanks to a culture change with 68% of our academic staff being returned in this REF\\n submission compared with 23% previously. Further details on the UOA research progress are\\n presented below for PROTECT and DSRC.\\n 1.2.3. PROTECT aims and achievements\\n After REF2014, PROTECT was expanded due to the internal restructuring of our Faculty in 2015\\n to include more staff with a wider range of research interests. This allowed the Centre to\\n broaden its research scope from the previous specific area of critical infrastructure systems to\\n                                                                                                  Page 2\\n\\n\\n the more general area of trustworthy computing systems with the aims stated in the previous\\n section. To manage the research, PROTECT was organised into the five research groups as\\n mentioned in Section 1.1. These groups allowed PROTECT to pool a wide range of expertise to\\n collaboratively address increasingly multi/inter-disciplinary research challenges while\\n accommodating flexibilities for individual groups to pursue their own research interests. This\\n tactical arrangement enabled PROTECT to contribute significantly to the UOA outputs and\\n secure over £3m external funding in this REF period. The following highlights exemplar\\n achievements involving joint efforts by different research groups:\\n \\uf0b7   Smart network connectivity: Our research in this area focused on building algorithms and\\n     frameworks for mobile/wireless networks and systems. For example, the EU H2020 funded\\n     Wi-5 project (01/2015-06/2018, link) provided support to this research, resulting in a platform\\n     for optimised and automatic connections to improve the efficiency of Wi-Fi services in\\n     congested environments (Bouhafs, Mackay, Raschella, Shi). The project results were then\\n     extended and evaluated in practical 5G settings (Mackay, Bouhafs, Waraich) through the\\n     DCMS (Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport) funded interdisciplinary Liverpool 5G\\n     Testbed project (03/2018-01/2020, link) for using 5G technologies to improve health and\\n     social care services, as reported in the UOA’s ICS3 (Impact Case Study 3 listed in Section\\n     1.3.3). The promising benefits demonstrated from the testbed led to a successful funding\\n     application to DCMS in 05/2020 for the Liverpool 5G Create project to further develop and\\n     widen these benefits (08/2020-03/2022, link).\\n \\uf0b7   Intelligent systems: Our work in this area was centred on developing machine learning based\\n     interdisciplinary techniques to support technology-assisted social care services and wildlife\\n     conservation. For instance, our work produced an intelligent technique that uses smart\\n     meters to support dementia patients living alone, partly supported by an EPSRC grant\\n     (06/2018-07/2019, EP/R020922/1), with a successful clinical trial by Mersey Care NHS\\n     Foundation Trust in 2016-2017 (Chalmers, Fergus, Hurst, Mackay). This work won the 3rd\\n     prize of the London Innovation Awards in 2015 and attracted wide interests with 11 national\\n     press articles and 4 government policy documents as detailed in the UOA’s ICS1. Our\\n     research also generated a machine learning based platform for animal identification and\\n     classification using camera traps and drones (Fergus, Chalmers), which is the first one made\\n     available for wildlife conservation organisations to use via conservationai.co.uk. This work\\n     was partly supported by an EPSRC GCRF grant (10/2019-03/2021, EP/T015403/1).\\n \\uf0b7   Trustworthy services: Our research in this area developed efficient and effective solutions to\\n     address trust and security challenges. For example, the EU FP7 funded Aniketos project\\n     (08/2010-05/2014, link) supported our work on generating solutions for modelling, composing\\n     and validating trustworthy composite services (Shi, Zhou). The modelling results were then\\n     used to create a unique 3D security requirements modelling platform (Zhou, Tang, Shi),\\n     partly funded by DCMS and Innovate UK (2017), which won the 2nd and 3rd prizes at the UK\\n     round and grand final of the China-UK Innovation & Entrepreneurship Competition in 2017,\\n     respectively. In addition, the EU H2020 funded Wise-IoT project (06/2016-05/2018, link) and\\n     Korea IITP funded TII project (06/2015-05/2018) advanced our research in IoT-based trust\\n     models with the results successfully tested in the Spanish city of Santander in 2018 (Lee).\\n     The software produced by the TII project was also certified by TTA (Telecommunications\\n     Technology Association supported by the Korean government) for commercial use. The\\n     models were then extended based on blockchain to address GDPR compliance (Lee)\\n     through another Korea IITP funded project GDPR-PIIM (04/2018-12/2020).\\n 1.2.4. DSRC aims and achievements\\n The overarching aim of DSRC remained on interpretation of machine learning, through\\n complementary research in novel methodology and practical application to real-world data. The\\n Centre secured £1.5m grants for research and enterprise. Its research was at the interface\\n between statistics and machine learning, achieving high performance with models understood by\\n end-users. Evidence for this approach is the award for winning a datathon to predict unexplained\\n behaviour in a complex chemical plant (see Section 4.2). Real-world impact extended also to\\n support for SMEs including job creation through the LCR (Liverpool City Region) Activate\\n                                                                                               Page 3\\n\\n\\n programme (see Section 4.2). Much of the research was closely aligned with external\\n collaborations, including:\\n \\uf0b7   Novel methodology: This covered three areas. First, we focused on machine learning models\\n     that are interpretable by design, relevant for high stakes applications, e.g., in medicine.\\n     Nomograms were frequently used in conventional medical statistics and we developed them\\n     for SVMs and with so-called Self-Explaining Neural Networks (Lisboa, Olier, Ortega,\\n     Jarman). Secondly, through a long-standing collaboration on brain tumour spectroscopy with\\n     Carlos Arús at the Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona (08/2013-07/2020), we predicted\\n     response to chemotherapy for the first time with this non-invasive method and saw the\\n     predictions validated with murine models (Ortega, Olier, Lisboa). Thirdly, a collaboration on\\n     drug discovery with Ross King (Alan Turing Institute and University of Cambridge, 10/2013-\\n     07/2020) and AstraZeneca (AZ, 10/2015-02/2019) led to novel approaches for QSARs\\n     (Olier), which AZ is using to find drug candidates to be repurposed to treat conditions\\n     different from those originally approved, potentially shortening the discovery time for new\\n     drugs.\\n \\uf0b7   Clinical decision support: The research aimed to i) optimise the design of ophthalmic studies\\n     by improving the sample size calculation, ii) model the noise in measurements from retina\\n     and cornea and propose how instruments should be used for diagnosis, and iii) build\\n     multivariate biostatistical methods for more accurate and explainable diagnosis (Czanner-G,\\n     Siekmann). We improved precision, so minimising patients being wrongly sent for a cross-\\n     linking operation (partly funded by the Clinical Eye Research Centre, Royal Liverpool\\n     University Hospital NHS Trust, 03/2014-08/2018). In diabetic retinopathy, we developed\\n     methods that underpin the decision support system for a national screening programme in\\n     China. We also developed a highly accurate interpretable algorithm to detect glaucoma\\n     (funded by EPSRC Mathematics in Healthcare Centre, Liverpool University, 11/2015-\\n     07/2019) in collaboration with Harvard/MIT. This led to the joint work on early glaucoma\\n     diagnosis with Aravind Eye Care System in India, University of Ulster and Lancaster\\n     University, featured in “Coming to terms with AI” in Eye News 26(2), Aug/Sep 2019.\\n \\uf0b7   Drug quantitative systems pharmacology: Our research was to develop innovative methods\\n     for pharmaceutical development (Webb, Kelly). We produced computational 3-D spheroid\\n     models of liver, backed by a novel experimental rig, which were used by AZ at their drug\\n     discovery phase to screen 5000 compounds for hepatic safety, impacting the choice of\\n     molecules to progress (see ICS4 for details).\\n 1.2.5. Interdisciplinary research and achievements\\n The above achievements show that UOA staff actively engaged in multi/inter-disciplinary\\n research through internal collaborations among staff in different disciplines and external\\n partnerships. In particular, the nature of the research in DSRC as well as the health and\\n conservation related work in PROTECT is inherently interdisciplinary. The research committees\\n at Centre, Faculty and University levels actively encouraged and facilitated interdisciplinary\\n collaborations, e.g., through joint PhD studentships and grant applications. The technology\\n centres such as Sensor City (a global hub for the development of sensor and IoT technologies)\\n and MTC (Manufacturing Technology Centre) affiliated with the University keenly brought the\\n academic staff and business users together to forge interdisciplinary research partnerships.\\n The above support enabled the UOA to deliver a sizable amount of interdisciplinary work\\n covering various disciplines such as healthcare, conservation, psychology, astrophysics, biology\\n and manufacturing. 39% of the outputs submitted and 60% of our grants include interdisciplinary\\n work. For instance, 12 papers were co-authored by our math staff (e.g., Lisboa) and those (e.g.,\\n Burniston, Robinson, UOA24) in the Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences at\\n LJMU, and an EPSRC funded project (08/2015-09/2016, EP/M029484/1) involved computing\\n (Dobbins) and psychophysiology (Fairclough, UOA04) staff to jointly develop a mobile lifelogging\\n platform.\\n 1.3. Impact strategy\\n 1.3.1. UOA strategy, plans and impact for period 2014-2020\\n                                                                                                 Page 4\\n\\n\\n Guided by the University and Faculty strategies to deliver impactful research, our UOA strategy\\n for achieving research impact during this REF period was to exploit existing collaborations with\\n known user organisations for impact realisation, encourage the wide dissemination of research\\n results to end users to seek other impact generation opportunities, and provide incentive support\\n to the staff for impact activities. We planned four measures to implement this strategy:\\n a) Identifying and focusing more effort on research areas of impact potential, in which we have\\n     strong expertise and existing user connections. This resulted in e-health systems, networking\\n     technology and data analytics flagged up as our focal areas.\\n b) Expanding our external engagements by energising research dissemination via multiple\\n     means such as conferences and events to seek new collaborators and joint grant\\n     applications to widen our impact generation.\\n c) Providing strong staff support, e.g., teaching and administrative workload reduction, funded\\n     external conference and event attendances, and promotion rewards, to incentivise and\\n     facilitate wider staff participation in impact activities.\\n d) Enhancing our cooperation with enterprise services within the Faculty and University as well\\n     as technology centres (e.g., Sensor City and MTC) to take advantage of their large user\\n     networks to explore other channels for wider impact opportunity identification.\\n The progress of the above activities was reviewed annually to identify necessary actions to take\\n to ensure the expected growth of the UOA impact that is summarised below:\\n \\uf0b7   Economic benefits: Our research produced better techniques for solving real-world problems,\\n     which were mostly the results of joint projects with users. For example, a user partner of the\\n     Wi-5 project mentioned in Section 1.2.3, AirTies in Turkey with over 30 million homes\\n     worldwide powered by their technology, adopted the project results to improve their customers’\\n     quality of experience (see ICS3 for details).\\n \\uf0b7   Enhanced public services: Our work on data analytics generated methods for better risk\\n     identification and prediction. The UOA’s ICS1 and ICS2 provide detailed examples for the\\n     impact generated. For example, ICS2 shows that our joint work with Merseyside Fire and\\n     Rescue Service led to reduced fire risks to lives and properties.\\n \\uf0b7   Technology-assisted wildlife conservation: Our research in this area used machine learning\\n     and drone technologies to develop smart animal identification and monitoring services for\\n     wildlife conservation. Eight organisations (see Section 4.1 for details) engaged in the research\\n     and field trials.\\n \\uf0b7   Policy and standard engagement: The UOA research generated impactful results. By engaging\\n     with government and standardisation bodies as well as the media, the results informed relevant\\n     policy making and technical standardisation. The UOA’s ICS1 and ICS3 provide examples. For\\n     instance, the work in ICS1 led to 4 government policy documents.\\n 1.3.2. Approach to impact\\n Our research impacts were achieved by exploiting a range of pathways to implement the\\n abovementioned measures a) – d). The impact approaches described in our REF2014\\n submission were adapted and extended to widen our impact activities in this REF period, as\\n detailed below.\\n 1. Targeted impact exploitation through existing user connections: To take measure a) forward,\\n we put particular efforts into advancing our research in two of the identified areas, e-health\\n systems and data analytics, while consolidating our connections with user organisations such as\\n Mersey Care NHS Trust and Merseyside Fire & Rescue Service. The results of the efforts are\\n reported in our ICS1, ICS2 and ICS4.\\n 2. Wider external engagement and collaboration: To implement measure b), we explored the\\n following ways for impact generation:\\n i. Targeted research dissemination: The staff were encouraged and funded for research\\n     dissemination via targeted conferences, journals, and public/trade events to seek\\n     collaborations. For example, a member of our staff (Merabti) met an attendee at the Wireless\\n     Days conference in November 2013. Their conversation led to the conception of an initial\\n                                                                                                Page 5\\n\\n\\n      research idea for collaboration and the subsequent formation of a consortium to successfully\\n      bid for the Wi-5 project with user partners to exploit the project impact (see ICS3).\\n ii. Funding applications to work with users: Relevant calls for proposals were disseminated to\\n      the staff regularly to encourage them to apply, and the progress and success in funding\\n      applications were reviewed and shared with the staff on a bimonthly basis to motivate more\\n      applications. These measures enabled user participation in 77% of our external grants.\\n iii. Public engagement: The staff were encouraged to participate in public events and other\\n      outreach activities for raising the awareness of issues related to their research. This helped\\n      to widen the research impact. For example, our smart meter based work was presented at\\n      the IBM think event in 2018 with over 40,000 delegates to promote its importance and\\n      potential (link).\\n iv. Influence on public policy and technical standardisation: The staff were motivated to use their\\n      research to inform and shape relevant policymaking and technical standardisation to\\n      increase the research impact. For example, a standard recommendation (Y.3055) by the\\n      GDPR-PIIM project mentioned in Section 1.2.3 was accepted by ITU-T that coordinates\\n      international standards for telecommunications and ICT.\\n v. Direct engagement with companies: This allowed the staff to directly interact with users for\\n      research dissemination and exploitation. In particular, we placed over 80 second year\\n      undergraduates on average per year. This gave the staff opportunities to directly engage with\\n      the placement organisations for impact exploitation. For example, the work in our ICS2 was\\n      initiated and developed through such engagement.\\n vi. Open source software: The UOA research produced a number of software prototypes.\\n      Making them freely accessible helps with their further development for wider impact. For\\n      example, the Korea IITP funded GDPR-PIIM project stated in Section 1.2.3 published its\\n      software code on GitHub (https://github.com/nguyentb/Personal-data-management).\\n 3. Staff support and reward: Regarding measure c), the staff support mentioned was\\n implemented, which will be detailed in Section 2.1.\\n 4. Enterprise services: To deliver measure d), we worked closely with the University and Faculty\\n for the use of their research and innovation services (see Section 2.1 for details). For instance,\\n we used the services to file a worldwide patent application about our smart meter based work\\n (see ICS1) and carry out an ongoing negotiation with interested parties for joint\\n commercialisation. Moreover, we utilised the technology centres to reach out for wider\\n collaborations. Notably, through Sensor City, we secured our participation in the two Liverpool\\n 5G projects mentioned in Section 1.2.3.\\n 1.3.3. Relationship to case studies\\n This UOA includes the following 4 impact case studies built on the approaches in Section 1.3.2,\\n where a reference like ‘(2.i, 3)’ indicates the use of approaches 2.i and 3 for the related impact:\\n \\uf0b7    ICS1 Smart Energy, Smart Care: This demonstrates the impact in one of our focused areas\\n      in collaboration with Mersey Care NHS Trust (1, 3), wide engagement with the media and\\n      government (2.i, 2.iii, 2.iv), and commercialisation efforts (4).\\n \\uf0b7    ICS2 Fire Prevention and Community Safety: Its impact shows the collaboration with\\n      Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service in another focused area (1, 2.v, 3) and the\\n      dissemination of fire risk profiles in fire safety communities (2.i, 2.iii).\\n \\uf0b7    ICS3 Wi-5: It presents the impact generated from projects Wi-5 and Liverpool 5G Testbed\\n      (2.i, 2.ii, 3, 4), dissemination and standardisation activities (2.iii, 2.iv), and project open\\n      source software (2.vi).\\n \\uf0b7    ICS4 Improving Drug Safety Screening: 3D – Liver Spheroid Toxicity Model: This illustrates\\n      the research impact exploitation with AstraZeneca in another focused areas (1, 2.ii, 2.v, 3)\\n      and the dissemination of the results produced (2.i).\\n 1.4. Future research and impact strategy\\n The UOA research and impact strategies and their implementation mechanisms stated in\\n Sections 1.2 and 1.3 will be consolidated to guide our future research and impact planning,\\n                                                                                                      Page 6\\n\\n\\n management and delivery. We will advance the UOA research and impact aims by broadening\\n our collaborative culture for excellent impactful research, extending the critical mass for higher\\n research productivity and capability to tackle complex multi/inter-disciplinary research issues,\\n and fostering research agility to embrace emerging research challenges and impact\\n opportunities within our expertise areas. More specifically, we will continue our research and\\n impact approaches for developing fundamental solutions and integrating them into impactful\\n applications. Particularly, we will invest more research efforts in the areas of secure technology\\n for 5G and beyond, intelligent and trustworthy e-healthcare systems, and big data analytics in\\n conservation and medicine. These areas fit well with this UOA’s research expertise and\\n interests, still pose significant research challenges, and possess great potentials for wide\\n research impacts. We will also encourage adaptability in our research to embrace new funding\\n opportunities, which will be discussed in Section 3.1. In addition, the research results produced\\n will be used to enrich our degree curriculums for the delivery of cutting-edge and exciting\\n education to our students.\\n 1.5. Open research environment\\n To increase the visibility and impact of our research, the University offers institutional repository\\n services, LJMU Research Online and LJMU Data Repository, for green open access to\\n published research material and data. A designated officer (Dishman) produces a quarterly open\\n access compliance report for each UOA. The reports help the UOA coordinator to monitor the\\n open access status of accepted outputs and take necessary actions to ensure their open access\\n compliance if needed. This resulted in 97% of our in-scope outputs being available in the\\n University’s repository and compliant with the REF open access policy.\\n The University and Faculty also provided funds for gold open access to outputs published in\\n journals such as IEEE Access and PLOS One to widen their dissemination and impact. 10% of\\n our outputs benefited from such open access.\\n Moreover, projects typically create their own websites (e.g., http://wise-iot.eu/en/home/) to\\n disseminate research findings, e.g., through project reports for open access, and share non-\\n private data to encourage further research. Another platform for research sharing is open source\\n repositories such as GitHub for program and data sharing as described in Section 1.3.2.\\n 1.6. Research integrity\\n The University’s Code of Practice for Research specifies the principles, responsibilities and\\n values for research integrity, which the UOA staff are expected to follow. The Code is important\\n for building trust, confidence and accountability in the research conducted in terms of the\\n methods developed, data used and findings derived, while meeting all legal, ethical and\\n professional requirements related to the research. These were embedded into our research\\n output generation and impact exploitation to meet the standards defined in the Code. The\\n support for this included the Code being part of the new staff induction and subsequent further\\n training (see Section 2.1). The staff research conduct was also monitored and reviewed\\n according to the Code as part of the annual PDPR (Personal Development and Performance\\n Review) to promote good practice and address related issues. These facilitated the UOA’s\\n research outputs and impact case studies in compliance with the Code.\\n 2. People\\n 2.1. Staffing strategy and staff development\\n Our staffing strategy is to recruit academic staff based on their ability to meet specific\\n requirements relating to both teaching and research. All candidates are required to outline their\\n potential contribution to research related activity and assessed on their capacity to strengthen\\n our impactful research. A total of 24 new academic staff appointed by the two Departments\\n (Computer Science and Applied Mathematics) during this REF period have been returned in this\\n UOA submission, and 6 of them have participated in funded projects as either PIs or CoIs. 9 of\\n the staff appointments were for the gradual replacement of 9 Category B staff who left due to\\n personal reasons (2) and promotion opportunities (7).\\n                                                                                                 Page 7\\n\\n\\n The Departments are committed to employ the best available academic staff on an equal\\n opportunity basis regardless of their personal background such as gender and nationality. This\\n has created a diverse international community that helps the Departments to forge international\\n collaborations (see Section 4.1). Currently, 45% of the staff are from other countries across four\\n continents, 12% of them are women, and the average staff age is 45 with 33% of them under 40\\n years old, which provides a reasonable age balance. The Departments also have a succession\\n plan to maintain the age balance in future staff recruitment and give opportunities to mid-career\\n academics to gain knowledge and experience in senior research roles (e.g., research group\\n leaders and centre directors) based on a 3-year rotation. These roles help the staff to progress\\n their careers, while providing stability for the research management of the Departments.\\n The strategy for staff development is to provide a wide range of personal and community-based\\n support mechanisms to meet staff needs at different stages of their careers. These include\\n training support at University level, e.g., an award-winning ACTivator programme provided by\\n the University for staff development, which is an important part of the University’s Strategic Plan.\\n On average, the programme delivers 12 workshops annually, covering a wide range of topics\\n from research integrity and leadership, through funding and impact generation, to IP\\n management. There were around 60 attendances to the workshops by the UOA staff between\\n 01/2016 and 07/2020. At Faculty level, experience sharing workshops are organised 3 or 4 times\\n a year for experienced staff to share their good practice and lessons learnt with other staff in\\n terms of successful grant applications to funding bodies like the EU, EPSRC and Innovate UK.\\n All the UOA staff have benefited from the workshops, e.g., the training helped three ECRs\\n (Dobbins, Tso, Hurst) to successfully obtain and complete their first EPSRC grants. At\\n Department level, two staff away days per year provide skill training, share good experience and\\n promote communication and collaboration for both research and teaching. Also 3 extra staff\\n away days have helped the staff to develop their action plans to raise the quality of their\\n research outputs and impacts.\\n Funding support is also available. This includes covering costs for the staff to attend\\n conferences and networking events to present their research results and seek collaboration and\\n funding opportunities. An annual average of £30k is budgeted for this purpose. Moreover, pump-\\n priming grants are offered at University, Faculty and Department levels for the staff to bid for\\n facilities needed to support their research and teaching. A total of £280k was awarded to the\\n UOA staff in this REF period. To accelerate the staff’s research, both the Faculty and University\\n offer research scholarships to attract excellent students. 60 of our PGR students obtained\\n scholarships during this REF period. To support research impact development, funding is\\n available at University and Department levels for targeted external engagement, which helped\\n the UOA to develop its impact case studies.\\n Additionally, personal support is in place to facilitate the staff in their career development. An\\n annual PDPR exercise provides an opportunity for the staff to work with their line managers to\\n review and plan their academic activities. The research-active staff are recognised by an\\n average reduction of 17% in teaching and administrative workloads. The allowance is even\\n higher for the staff with external funding based on their budgeted time, and also a further\\n reduction of 10% is given to the staff leading impact case studies. These enable the staff to\\n pursue their research and impact agenda often supported by PGR students and/or RAs. There is\\n an internal annual quality review of research outputs and impact case studies, and the feedback\\n from the review is provided to individual staff for quality improvement. To support funding\\n applications, the University’s Research & Innovation Services (RIS) together with the Finance\\n and Faculty support offices helps individual staff to prepare applications and provide post-award\\n support if funded, which are assisted by a Grants and Projects (GaP) system. RIS also runs a\\n biweekly drop-in session onsite before the COVID-19 pandemic and online during the pandemic\\n to advise staff on funding issues. Their services have benefited all our staff with external funding.\\n The information on the grant applications is circulated bimonthly within the Faculty to\\n acknowledge the staff’s effort and encourage more funding applications.\\n To recognise the staff’s achievements and motivate them for more success, award support is\\n offered by the University under its annual Professorship and Readership Conferment scheme to\\n promote those staff with excellent contributions to the University’s research, impact and\\n                                                                                                Page 8\\n\\n\\n scholarship activities. During this REF period, 7 staff returned in this UOA were conferred as\\n professors (Al-Jumeily and Hussain) and readers (Fergus, Hurst, Lee, Shamsa and Zhou). Along\\n with this scheme, the University runs a biennial professorial performance review to reward good\\n performers and help others for on-going improvements. In addition, there is an annual staff event\\n for the LJMU Vice-Chancellor’s Awards for Excellence in Research, Scholarship & Knowledge\\n Transfer to showcase that such excellence is high on the University’s agenda. For example, Lee\\n received a Vice-Chancellor’s Award for his research achievements, and Hurst an Early Career\\n Researcher Award for Impact, in 2017.\\n To foster a collaborative culture for increasingly multi/inter-disciplinary research in the UOA’s\\n subject areas, community support is essential. This includes a biweekly research seminar\\n programme combining talks in different Departments within the Faculty to allow the staff and\\n PGR students to learn emerging research topics, share research findings, stimulate further\\n studies and promote collaborations. Also, the PROTECT (via its research groups) and DSRC\\n centres organise regular meetings to discuss specific research challenges and gather joint\\n efforts to address them through co-authored research publications and collaborative projects.\\n Moreover, the University affiliated technology centres such as Sensor City and MTC host regular\\n industrial events that provide networking opportunities for the staff to directly engage with\\n companies to exploit collaboration potential. These efforts led to 41% of our submitted outputs\\n with internal co-authors and 80% of our research income involving internal collaborations.\\n For research sustainability, ECR support is important, particularly for helping new staff to\\n quickly settle down in new working environments, integrate themselves into existing research\\n groups/centres, and develop essential academic skills. In addition to all the aforementioned\\n support applicable to ECRs, each new ECR receives initial inductions and handbooks given at\\n both University and Department levels and is assigned a line manager and a senior colleague (a\\n professor or reader) as a research mentor, who offer regular guidance on academic activities\\n and standards expected. The research mentor also helps the ECR to join a research centre(s)\\n and PGR supervisory teams, and participate in collaborative projects, which enable them to gain\\n wider experience in research activities. Normally, ECRs are given higher priorities for pump-\\n priming grants and research scholarship awards, and a special upskilling funding scheme\\n operated annually by the University in recent years allows senior staff to mentor ECRs for raising\\n their competence in REF-able output generation. For example, during this REF period, each\\n ECR returned in this submission received at least one pump-priming grant, 13 of them got\\n scholarships, and 2 secured upskilling grants.\\n Furthermore, new staff enjoy lighter workloads. They are normally assigned only one third of the\\n normal workload in the first year, two thirds in the second year and the normal workload from the\\n third year onwards, which allows them to gradually take on teaching duties while enabling the\\n continuation of their research. A one-year (3 hours per week) postgraduate certificate course on\\n teaching and learning as well as a PhD supervision workshop are delivered by the University to\\n assist them in gaining relevant academic skills, which forms an important part of their career\\n development. Also, the support provided to and the performance delivered by ECRs are\\n routinely monitored for additional assistance if needed. These are considered by probation\\n reviews toward the end of the 3-year probationary period to determine those staff’s suitability for\\n their jobs. All the academic staff apart from one recruited in this REF period successfully passed\\n the probationary period after 3-years employment, and 3 of them obtained funding under the\\n EPSRC First Grant or New Investigator Award scheme.\\n The Research Concordat is also implemented to support the career development of\\n researchers. It operates a robust action plan delivered through a Concordat Task Group and\\n overseen by the University Research, Scholarship & Knowledge Transfer Committee. The Group\\n used a Careers in Research Online Survey (CROS) before 2018, which has been replaced by\\n the Culture, Employment and Development in Academic Research Survey (CEDARS), to identify\\n areas for improvement and take necessary actions to fulfil it. The good performance of this plan\\n was recognised by the EU HR Excellence in Research Award in 2012 that was successfully\\n retained following biennial reviews in 2014, 2016 and 2018. The UOA staff actively participated\\n in and benefited from the scheme, e.g., through the ACTivator programme mentioned earlier.\\n                                                                                                Page 9\\n\\n\\n 2.2. PGR students\\n PGR student recruitment is crucial to the UOA for the delivery of its research and impact\\n strategies, and is managed by a support team at Faculty level. To recruit qualified students, we\\n advertise PhD opportunities widely through external websites such as www.findaphd.com, the\\n University’s own website, graduate career events and our own undergraduate and masters\\n programmes. Each application received is reviewed by potential supervisors to check the\\n applicant’s qualifications. If qualified, an interview with at least two academic staff is carried out\\n before a place can be offered. On average, the UOA recruits 14 PGR students per year.\\n During this REF period, both the University and Faculty invested significantly in PhD\\n studentships in order to attract high calibre candidates for PhD research. The funding was\\n provided via a number of means from fully funded University and Faculty scholarships, through\\n fee paying only at Faculty level, to match-funded studentships at University and Faculty levels\\n with financial contributions from outside organisations. 60 of our PGR students were funded by\\n some of these schemes.\\n A number of monitoring and support mechanisms are in place to guide PGR students through\\n their study process. For initial support to new students, the University’s Doctoral Academy (DA)\\n runs an induction about PhD research, and the Faculty provides another induction about local\\n research environments and codes of conduct. Each student is then assigned to a supervisory\\n team normally consisting of three supervisors including one experienced supervisor and one\\n ECR for training purposes or a business/industrial partner for practical expertise. They set up a\\n weekly meeting to discuss the research. All the supervisors must complete the supervisor\\n training delivered by the DA. The student is also allocated an office space with a high\\n specification PC and has access to our networking, cyber security and AR/VR research\\n laboratories if needed and the well-stocked University library services including IEEE Xplore.\\n The progress monitoring of PGR students involves several stages, supported by an online\\n progression system (eDoc). Every student submits a registration application approved by the\\n supervisors within the first 3-month enrolment, which is assessed by the Faculty Research\\n Degree Committee (FRDC) including one senior member of the staff from each department.\\n After the registration is approved by the FRDC and then DA, the supervisors undertake a review\\n with the student within the first 6-month enrolment to discuss their research progress and first-\\n year goals. The student then submits a report on their progress and further research plan within\\n the first 12-month enrolment for the first-year review. A review panel including at least two\\n supervisors and an independent assessor appointed by the FRDC holds an interview with the\\n student to examine the quality of the reported work. If the work is considered inappropriate, the\\n student could change the registration to MPhil or terminate the studies. Otherwise, the student\\n remains registered for PhD. During this REF period, 96% of our PGR students successfully\\n passed their first-year reviews.\\n For those students who continue for PhD, there is a subsequent monitoring exercise organised\\n annually by the DA. Each student completes a progress monitoring form with comments from the\\n supervisors, which the FRDC reviews and recommends necessary actions if needed, before\\n passing the form to the DA for further consideration. The arrangement of a PhD viva by the\\n supervisors needs to be reviewed and approved by both the FRDC and DA.\\n Communication support is also available for students to voice their needs. Supervisors\\n normally have regular dialogues with their students in terms of the support needed, which are\\n recorded in the annual progress monitoring forms. There is an elected PGR student\\n representative in each Department, who sits in FRDC meetings and liaises regularly with the\\n research centres’ directors and a designated support officer to discuss the students’ needs. The\\n University runs a biennial Postgraduate Research Experience Survey to collect students’ views\\n on research and support at Faculty level, e.g., with an overall satisfaction of 79% for our Faculty\\n in the 2019 survey. These mechanisms allow students’ voices on their needed support to be\\n heard at different levels for necessary actions to be taken.\\n Community support is an important part of PhD studies. Our Faculty manages a series of\\n biweekly seminars given by PGR students with each presenting a couple of talks within their\\n study period to allow them to share research findings, gather feedback for further investigation\\n                                                                                                  Page 10\\n\\n\\n and practise presentation skills. The Faculty also organises an annual research student\\n conference including invited keynote speeches, selected student presentations, lively poster\\n sessions and prizes for the best papers and PhD theses to recognise and celebrate the\\n students’ successes and encourage better quality research. For example, 6 of our PGR students\\n won the best PhD thesis prizes between 2018 and 2020. Coupled with this conference, the\\n University runs a DA Conference to widen the dissemination of students’ research\\n achievements.\\n To provide bespoke technical support to students’ research, there is a team of 8 technicians\\n who maintain our research labs and assist individual students in using the lab facilities to\\n conduct their research. The students are encouraged to publish their research findings. The\\n University and Faculty offer travel funds for attending at least one conference by each PGR\\n student during their study period, and extra funding may be available for more conference\\n attendances if their research is related to funded projects. Moreover, the Faculty provides a free\\n English proof reading service to help international students improve the English quality of their\\n theses.\\n Training support for generic skills development is delivered via several mechanisms. The DA\\n runs a Researcher Development Programme covering a wide range of training topics, e.g.,\\n systematic literature reviews, research ethics, technical writing, presentation skills, impact\\n engagement, job application and interview skills. The DA also delivers a training course on\\n teaching and learning, which is compulsory to take by those PGR students who want to support\\n teaching labs and student tutorials. Their departments then make arrangements for them to gain\\n practical experience, which is particularly valuable if the students want to seek academic\\n careers.\\n The above monitoring and support measures led to a significant increase of our PhD\\n completions in this REF period by an annual average of 172% over those for REF2014.\\n 2.3. Equality and diversity\\n The University sets out its commitment and policy to promote an environment where everyone is\\n treated equally and with dignity and respect. It holds an institutional Athena SWAN Bronze\\n award. To raise the awareness and compliance of the policy, the University delivers a series of\\n training workshops and events every year (e.g., 4 in academic year 2020-2021). Each member\\n of the staff is required to complete an online training course on the issues of equality and\\n diversity annually, and the issues also form part of the PDPR exercise. In addition, the\\n Departments operate an open and fair staff recruitment process with at least one female\\n academic in each recruitment panel. These measures have resulted in a diverse staff profile as\\n stated in Section 2.1. Among 42 Category A staff returned to this UOA, 5 are women, reflecting\\n the on-going challenges in female staff recruitment for STEM subjects. One of the 5 women is a\\n professor, representing a higher percentage (i.e. 20%) of professorial promotion than 11% for\\n the male staff. The average numbers of outputs submitted by the female staff and ECRs are 2.2\\n and 2.3 that are 12% and 18% higher than those for the male and non-ECR staff, respectively.\\n 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n 3.1. Income portfolio\\n The UOA strategy for income generation is to align our research with the priority areas of\\n funding bodies and increase our efforts in funding applications. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the\\n UOA staff are well supported and advised by the research and innovation services at both\\n University and Faculty levels to produce funding applications and deliver the ones that are\\n successfully funded. These led to a significant increase of the UOA research income in this REF\\n period with a total of £4.4m up from £1.1m for REF2014, which was achieved by a 200% rise of\\n staff participation in the funded projects.\\n Figure 1 below illustrates a breakdown of our income from different sources for this REF\\n period in comparison with our REF2014 figures. Clearly, the largest income comes from the EU,\\n rising to nearly 8 times higher than our REF2014 figure. The second largest income is from the\\n UK government with nearly 4 times over our REF2014 amount. Also the biggest growth of our\\n income comes from UKRI, showing nearly 47 times higher than our REF2014 figure. However,\\n                                                                                                Page 11\\n\\n\\n the increase of our income from other sources is much lower with 19%, and the incomes from\\n industry and charities are 4% and 35% less than the REF2014 figures, respectively. This is\\n because funding opportunities from our engagement with these sectors were limited, partly due\\n to the economic uncertainty caused by Brexit.\\n Examples of our main funded collaborative projects with a total budget of over £1m for each\\n include: ANIKETOS: Secure and Trustworthy Composite Services (EU FP7, €9.6m, 08/2010-\\n 05/2014); Wi-5: What to do With the Wi-Fi Wild West (EU H2020, €2.1m, 01/2015-06/2018);\\n Wise-IoT: Worldwide Interoperability for SEmantics IoT (EU H2020, €1.5m, 06/2016-05/2018);\\n Liverpool 5G Testbed (DCMS, £3.5m, 03/2018-01/2020); Liverpool 5G Create (DCMS, £4.3m,\\n 08/2020-03/2022); LCR Activate - Digital Accelerator (ERDF - European Regional Development\\n Fund, £2.1m, 2017-2020, link); TII (Trusted Information Infrastructure): S/W Framework for\\n Realizing Trustworthy IoT Eco-system ( Korea IITP: £5m, 06/2015-05/2018, converted based on\\n 1 GBP = 1,489 KRW on 23/09/2020); and GDPR-PIIM: GDPR Compliant Personally Identifiable\\n Information Management Technology for IoT Environment (Korea IITP, £1.6m, 04/2018-\\n 12/2020). In addition, examples of our EPSRC-funded projects include ‘Using Drones to Protect\\n Biodiversity and Spur Economic Growth in Madagascar’ (£574k, 10/2019-03/2021) and three\\n awards to our ECRs (Dobbins, Tso, Hurst) under the First Grant or New Investigator Award\\n scheme (£100k per project).\\n                                Figure 1: Research income and sources\\n The above grants helped to advance the UOA research with significant outcomes in terms of\\n high-quality outputs and impact. These include publications in high-quality academic journals,\\n e.g., IEEE TMC, IEEE TIFS and IEEE TNSM, as evidenced by the UOA’s submitted outputs.\\n The project results were also exploited to create impacts as shown in our impact case studies.\\n It is evident from Figure 1 that we will need to extend our funding sources for future income\\n and impact generation. While endeavouring to sustain and even increase our income from the\\n EU, UK government and UKRI, it is imperative for the UOA to extend its engagement with other\\n available funding bodies. In particular, we will seek further collaborations with charity and\\n industry organisations as only 1% and 6% of the UOA research income come from these two\\n sectors, respectively. As our research is grounded on practical solutions to tackle real-world\\n problems, we will invest more efforts in exploring collaboration opportunities in these two sectors\\n to expand the income and impact of our research.\\n 3.2. Infrastructure and facilities\\n The research infrastructure and facilities supporting this UOA are invested and operated at\\n University, Faculty and Department levels. At University level, LJMU’s document REF5a\\n presents the details of the support provided by the University. The support most relevant to the\\n UOA includes the provision of office space and standard IT services, digital resources like IEEE\\n Xplore and the institutional repositories for open access, and research support (e.g., by RIS and\\n DA) to assist the staff in funding applications and offer administrative support to PGR students.\\n As stated in Section 2, the UOA staff have benefited significantly from the University’s support.\\n In addition, the University invested in Sensor City in partnership with the University of Liverpool,\\n supported by a £10m grant from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\\n and the England ERDF, to create a global innovation hub for sensor technology in 2017. It\\n                                                                                               Page 12\\n\\n\\n provides the UOA staff with a venue for user engagement and a platform for the joint exploitation\\n of sensor-related applications.\\n At Faculty level, the University allows its QR funding together with other research income and\\n office/lab improvement budgets to be dispersed to faculties. This enabled our Faculty to invest in\\n infrastructure and facilities over this REF period. The main investment relevant to this UOA is\\n three-fold. First, office and lab space in the Departments involved in this UOA was improved and\\n expanded with a spending total of £2.7m. The total space increased by 20% in comparison with\\n that in the previous REF period. Notably, the space for two new labs, LIVE Lab and Machine\\n Learning, was allocated to meet increasing needs for research, impact generation and teaching\\n in usability studies and intelligent systems. Also, the yearly average number of our PGR\\n students in this REF period increased by 32% over the previous REF period. To meet the\\n growing office space demand, the Faculty acquired extra offices and moved all the PGR\\n students there, which in effect added further space to improve the condition of the UOA staff’s\\n offices.\\n Secondly, in addition to the standard IT facilities operated by the University, the Department of\\n Computer Science runs more specialist computing labs with the facilities upgraded normally\\n every 5 years. Similarly, the UOA staff and PGR students have computer facilities in their offices\\n with an upgrade cycle of 5 years. The cost of such facility upgrades amounted to a total of over\\n £1.1m in this REF period. Also, the two new labs have cutting-edge facilities for the development\\n and delivery of immersive, virtual, mixed and augmented reality technologies as well as high\\n performance computers and large data storages for machine learning based data analytics,\\n which costed a total of over £250k. To support individual staff or groups’ research, the Faculty\\n offers pump-priming and capital equipment grants for the staff to apply in order to acquire\\n specialist facilities needed for their research and impact generation. A total of £280k was\\n awarded to the UOA staff over this REF period, e.g., for purchasing cloud servers and mobile\\n devices.\\n Moreover, all the faculty-funded facilities are shared among different departments and\\n research centres to promote cross-subject research collaborations. Notably, the Faculty invested\\n £700k in a much more powerful high-performance computing facility between 2018 and 2019. It\\n comprises 1,280 AMD Rome processing cores in 20 high-density HPE Apollo compute nodes,\\n networked with the high-bandwidth, low-latency HDR Infiniband fabric and supported by a\\n parallel BeeGFS file system with a total memory footprint of 10TB and a long-term storage\\n capacity of 1.5PB. The facility offers excellent capabilities for our UOA staff to conduct\\n computationally intensive data processing experiments.\\n Thirdly, in this REF period, the Faculty invested in setting up a dedicated team of 5 admin staff\\n to support research-active staff in external funding applications, funded project management,\\n staff training and PGR administration. The team liaises between the Faculty academic staff and\\n the University’s RIS and DA to reduce the staff’s administrative workload on funding and PGR\\n related activities and thus give them more time to focus on research matters. The team also\\n works closely with senior research-active staff to review and advise on funding applications. This\\n UOA benefited significantly from the team’s support during this REF period, evidenced by the\\n increased research income and PhD completions as discussed earlier.\\n At Department level, the infrastructure and facilities provided by the University and Faculty\\n were complemented by further pump-priming funding with around £20k per year from our\\n Departments in the last three years of this REF period. This allowed the UOA staff to upgrade\\n facilities in the existing research labs such as those for information security, networking and\\n gaming in order to engage in up-to-date research and impact activities. For example, the\\n facilities provide an integrated environment involving IoT devices, cloud servers and GPU-based\\n computers for research experiments on smart and secure IoT systems, and a 5G testbed for the\\n simulation and evaluation of wireless resource optimisation techniques. There is a team of 8\\n technicians in the Department of Computer Science to provide the operational support and\\n maintenance of all the computing facilities accessible by the UOA staff and PGR students. In\\n addition, there is an annual budget of £30k provided by our Departments for other financial\\n support, e.g., research consumables and travel.\\n                                                                                              Page 13\\n\\n\\n The aforementioned infrastructure and facilities underpinned the UOA’s impact activities during\\n this REF period. This is because they allowed the UOA staff to develop new expertise through\\n the implementation and evaluation of research findings and then disseminate the successfully\\n validated results to interested research users for impact exploitation. The UOA’s impact case\\n studies demonstrate such links from infrastructure and facility utilisation to impact generation.\\n For fair funding distribution, applications to each funding scheme mentioned earlier are normally\\n assessed by a group of senior staff who have completed the equality and diversity training\\n delivered by the University and form a balanced representation of the applicants. The\\n assessment takes into account factors such as application merits, staff personal circumstances\\n and ECR support for decision making to ensure fair funding allocation and equal opportunities\\n for all. This is then followed by a feedback process to resolve any concerns raised by the staff.\\n To access funded facilities shared by a few users (e.g., the 5G testbed), the sharing is often\\n agreed and arranged among the users themselves. For facilities in high demand (e.g., high\\n performance computers), a set of criteria and a booking system are normally used to ensure\\n fairness in the facility sharing.\\n 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society\\n 4.1. Collaborations\\n The UOA staff have long recognised the growing trend of technological convergence and the\\n important value of collaboration to address multi/inter-disciplinary research challenges brought\\n about as a result of this. Such recognition has been reflected in the UOA research strategy in\\n Section 1.2.1 with a focus on collaboration. During this REF period, a number of measures were\\n taken to facilitate and support collaboration as described in the previous sections. These\\n measures led to successful collaborations at local, national and international levels, which were\\n built on concerted effort and complementary expertise to make more significant research\\n findings and impact as shown in the UOA’s submitted outputs and impact case studies and\\n generate more research income as discussed in Section 3.1. Specifically, these collaborations\\n include:\\n \\uf0b7   Funded research collaborations: The UOA staff were active in seeking external funding for\\n     collaborative research and successful in delivering funded projects, which enabled the staff\\n     to collaborate internally and with academic and research institutions worldwide for joint\\n     research. 80% and 83% of the UOA income involve internal and external collaborations,\\n     respectively. For example, our funded international collaborations include:\\n     - 4 European (e.g., University of Cantabria in Spain, and Institut Mines-Télécom in France)\\n          and 5 Korean (e.g., Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, and\\n          Kyungpook National University) institutions as project partners on the EU and Korea joint\\n          Wise-IoT project to build federated and interoperable platforms for secure IoT\\n          applications (Lee).\\n     - 7 institutions (e.g., SINTEF in Norway, University of Salzburg in Austria, Waterford\\n          Institute of Technology in Ireland, and University of Trento in Italy) as project partners on\\n          the EU FP7 Aniketos project to develop trustworthy service composition techniques (Shi,\\n          Zhou).\\n     - 1 institution Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB) in Spain, supported by projects\\n          including EU FP7-PEOPLE TRANSACT (03/2013-02/2017), to investigate novel ways of\\n          data representation, e.g., for medical images (Lisboa, Ortega, Olier).\\n     - 1 institution Le Quy Don Technical University (LQDTU) in Vietnam through Royal\\n          Academy of Engineering and Vietnamese Government funded projects (03/2017-\\n          06/2019) to design new intrusion detection methods (Shi, Shone, Askwith, Zhou, Mac\\n          Dermott).\\n     These funded projects successfully delivered novel techniques and tools and generated\\n     research publications to disseminate them. For example, the collaboration with UAB resulted\\n     in 12 journal articles (e.g., in PLOS ONE), 8 conference papers (e.g., in IEEE IJCNN) and\\n     one book chapter. The collaboration with LQDTU led to a journal publication (“A Deep\\n     Learning Approach to Network Intrusion Detection Computational Intelligence for Cloud\\n                                                                                                 Page 14\\n\\n\\n     Computing”, IEEE TETCI, Vol. 2, No. 1, 2018) with 8,900+ views and 130+ citations (link).\\n \\uf0b7   Research user engagement: The majority of the UOA’s projects involved research users as\\n     project partners or advisers to ensure that the project outcomes address their needs and\\n     have lasting impact on the improvements of their products or services. This led to\\n     collaborations with a wide range of user organisations including large international\\n     companies such as NEC, SAP and Samsung. Examples of the user involvement in the\\n     UOA’s projects include:\\n     - 15 telecommunication operators (e.g., Orange in France, EE in the UK, and Ziggo in\\n          Netherlands) as project advisory board members and 3 industrial partners (e.g.,\\n          Telefónica in Spain and AirTies in Turkey) on the EU Wi-5 project to develop optimised\\n          connectivity for Wi-Fi services, adopted by AirTies to improve their services as detailed in\\n          ICS3 (Mackay, Bouhafs, Raschella, Shi).\\n     - 7 companies (e.g., Blu Wireless, and eHealth Cluster) and 2 public organisations\\n          (Liverpool City Council, and Royal Liverpool & Broadgreen University Hospital Trust) as\\n          project partners on the Liverpool 5G Testbed project for improving people’s health and\\n          wellbeing, with extra funding to further exploit the project impact through Liverpool 5G\\n          Create (Mackay, Bouhafs, Waraich, Raschella, Fergus, Chalmers, Zhou).\\n     - 8 wildlife conservation related organisations (e.g., Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust,\\n          BBC Natural History Unit, and Endangered Wildlife Trust in South Africa) engaging with\\n          our work on animal detection for wildlife conservation, but unfortunately several\\n          scheduled field trials with some of these organisations had to be halted due to the\\n          COVID‑ 19 pandemic (Fergus, Chalmers).\\n \\uf0b7   Interdisciplinary research collaborations: As stated in Section 1.2.5, interdisciplinary\\n     research relies on collaborations and forms a significant part of the UOA submission. The\\n     last two projects above clearly show interdisciplinary nature, e.g., the work on wildlife\\n     conservation involves collaborations among staff in the Department of Computer Science,\\n     Astrophysics Research Institute, and the School of Biological & Environmental Sciences at\\n     LJMU.\\n \\uf0b7   Other research collaborations: In addition to internal collaborations, the UOA staff actively\\n     reached out to establish collaborations with individual researchers in other institutions\\n     worldwide (e.g., in France, China, Korea and Australia) for joint research. This helped to\\n     increase the significance of their research findings and thus lead to high quality research\\n     outputs and grant awards. For example, 89% and 41% of the UOA’s submitted outputs have\\n     external and internal co-authors respectively, and grants such as Wise-IoT involve prior\\n     external research collaborations.\\n \\uf0b7   International research visits: An important measure for promoting fruitful research\\n     collaborations is to host research visitors and send staff to visit other institutions to\\n     accelerate the generation of joint research publications or funding applications. During this\\n     REF period, the UOA staff received 28 research visitors from other countries, e.g., Prof\\n     J.D.M. Guerrero from the University of Valencia in Spain (05-10/2013, 05-09/2016), Dr T.\\n     Shinagawa from the University of Tokyo in Japan (09/2017), and Dr F. den Hartog from\\n     UNSW Canberra in Australia (11/2019). The UOA staff also made 30 visits to foreign\\n     institutions, e.g., Kelly to the University of Michigan in the USA (09/2015), Zhou to Zhejiang\\n     University in China (07/2018), and Czanner-G to Aravind Eye Care System in India\\n     (07/2019).\\n 4.2. Contributions\\n Sections 1 and 4.1 have highlighted the UOA’s research and impact contributions to various\\n disciplines, including national and international priority areas identified by the EU and EPSRC, in\\n terms of advancing state-of-the-art technologies and setting further agendas for sustainable\\n research. Wider contributions were also made during this REF period to benefit different\\n communities and publics from the UOA research. These are illustrated through the following\\n examples:\\n \\uf0b7   Supported 150 SMEs in the LCR for the technology-assisted improvement of their products\\n     and services through the LCR Activate - Digital Accelerator project (Lisboa) mentioned in\\n                                                                                                Page 15\\n\\n\\n     Section 3.1, which created 70 gross jobs and generated £2.7m in GVA for the local economy\\n     based on a beneficiary survey (link).\\n \\uf0b7   Organised a British Council funded Newton Researcher Links Workshop on Health and Well-\\n     being through VR and AR in China on 27-30/06/2018 (El Rhalibi, Kolivand, Shen) to help\\n     ECRs to explore research collaboration opportunities, with 20 participants from each of the\\n     UK and China (link).\\n \\uf0b7   Produced a VR proton beam therapy unit in collaboration with Interserve and Christie\\n     Hospital Manchester (Hurst, Shone, Tully), which was partly supported by the Innovate UK\\n     ProAccel project (12/2017-05/2018, link) and played by the mayor of Manchester and 500+\\n     visitors on the opening weekend (07/2018) of the hospital’s new Proton Beam Therapy\\n     Centre (link).\\n \\uf0b7   Applied the UOA’s pedagogical research in network security to ease students’ difficulty in\\n     studying the topic by producing and releasing a series of story-based animations about\\n     network security protocols (Kifayat, Shi, Shone) on YouTube (link), which was funded by the\\n     UK Higher Education Academy (11/2015-02/2017) and received a total of 44,000+ views\\n     (available on request due to changes to some view numbers) since 02/2017.\\n \\uf0b7   Developed an AR application for life-science education in collaboration with Aberdeen\\n     University and Imagin3D (Hurst, Tully), which appeared on BBC News Scotland and a front\\n     cover of Physiology News Magazine (link), is now used for teaching first-year biology\\n     students at Aberdeen University and shown to school children (link).\\n In addition, the UOA staff actively contributed to a wide range of other academic activities in\\n terms of community engagement and leadership. These include:\\n \\uf0b7   Advisory/standardisation boards: 35 roles were contributed by the UOA staff. Examples\\n     include Vice-Chair for Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions-Individual Fellowships (Lisboa, 2018-\\n     2020), Chair/Co-Chair of H2020 Expert Advisory Group for SC1: Health, Demographic\\n     Change and Wellbeing (Lisboa, 2014-2018), Vice Chair for H2020 FET-OPEN (Fergus,\\n     2016-2020), and Chair of ITU-T Focus Group on Data Processing and Management (Lee,\\n     2015-2020).\\n \\uf0b7   Prizes/awards: 20 awards were given to the UOA staff, e.g., the best papers at IEEE ICME\\n     2018 (Sheng) and IEEE iThings 2017 (Yang), one of the two winners of a datathon with a\\n     shared prize of €50k organised by national oil company Galp in Portugal in 11/2019 (Olier),\\n     and the 3rd prize of the London Innovation Awards in 2015 (Chalmers, Fergus).\\n \\uf0b7   Research fellowships: 2 grants were awarded to the UOA staff. Ortega with the support of\\n     Lisboa secured an EU Marie Curie Research Fellowship (10/2013-03/2016, €231k). Kelly\\n     was awarded an early career mini fellowship by the In Vitro Toxicology Society (IVTS) (2015,\\n     £1,500).\\n \\uf0b7   Journal editorships: 22 roles were held by the UOA staff. Examples include Academic\\n     Editors in PLOS ONE (Ortega and Olier, 2018-now), Associate Editor in BMJ Open\\n     Ophthalmology (Czanner-G, 2016-now), and Associate Editor (Yang) in IEEE JTEHM (2018-\\n     now) and IEEE Access (2018-now).\\n \\uf0b7   Conference/workshop chairs: 58 chair positions were served by the UOA staff, including\\n     T6 Programme Chair of IEEE CCNC (El Rhalibi, 2017-2018), Programme Chair of IEEE-\\n     CIBD (Lisboa, 2015), Series Co-chairs of IEEE DeSE (Al-Jumeily and Hussain, 2007-now),\\n     and General Chair of TENAS (Pereira, 2014-now).\\n \\uf0b7   Keynotes/invited talks: 142 speeches were given by our staff. For example, keynotes\\n     include IEEE ICCT 2015 (El Rhalibi), IEEE ICDM 2016 and IDEAL 2019 (Lisboa). Talks were\\n     given at Microsoft Research (Savoye, 02/2016) and MIT (Czanner-G, 09/2017, 06/2018) in\\n     the USA as well as Westminster Sustainable Business Forum (Chalmers, 07/2016).\\n \\uf0b7   Journal editorial boards: 21 memberships were taken up by our staff, e.g., Applied Soft\\n     Computing (Lisboa, 2013-2015), Graefe’s Archive for Clinical and Experimental\\n     Ophthalmology (Czanner-G, 2012-now), and Biosensors & Bioelectronics (Lee, 2018).\\n                                                                                             Page 16\\n\\n\\n \\uf0b7   Conference committees: 60+ memberships were served by the UOA staff.

Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n Computer Science research at Manchester Metropolitan University focuses on the real-world\\n applications of technology that are of strategic importance to the UK’s economy and society.\\n Research in artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity aligns to local and national Research\\n and Development (R&D) priorities. Leadership of collaborative initiatives such as the Greater\\n Manchester AI Foundry and Cyber Foundry consortia give us the means to translate our\\n research into economic and commercial impacts. Interdisciplinary research with healthcare,\\n social science and agriculture is rapidly expanding and leading to new developments that are\\n transforming the lives of people across the world.\\n The vitality and sustainability of our research and impact strategy is evidenced by:\\n     \\uf0b7 A 100% increase in the number of staff that we are returning to REF 2021.\\n     \\uf0b7 A 156% increase in research income from £1.4m in REF 2014 to £3.58m in REF 2021.\\n     \\uf0b7 A 113% increase in PhD completions from 16 in REF 2014 to 34 in REF 2021.\\n     \\uf0b7 Leadership of the £12m AI Foundry and Cyber Foundry projects.\\n Unit context and structure\\n Research is led by the Centre for Advanced Computational Science (CfACS), one of 14 flagship\\n University Centres for Research and Knowledge Exchange (UCRKE) that were established as\\n part of the University’s ambitious RKE Strategy (see REF 5a).\\n CfACS is quality-focused and innovation-driven. It was created following an assessment of REF\\n 2014 results mapped against areas of growing research excellence that link into the strategic\\n policy landscape including the Industrial Strategy, the Science and Innovation Audit and the\\n national skills agenda. CfACS was approved with a five-year development plan that outlines its\\n management structures, research themes and includes specific funding, publication, citation,\\n impact and staffing strategies.\\n Yonghong Peng (Professor of Artificial Intelligence) and Liangxiu Han (Professor of\\n Computational Science) provide leadership for CfACS, which includes 54 staff (29 full research\\n members with a significant responsibility for research, seven research assistants, seven\\n Knowledge Exchange members who lead on industrial collaboration and ten associate members\\n undertaking research skills development). CfACS currently has 40 PGR students.\\n CfACS is submitting 23 staff to B11 with a further six staff submitted to B12 Engineering. Staff in\\n CfACS are from the Department of Computing and Maths in the Science and Engineering\\n Faculty, one of the UK’s largest providers of research-led teaching in Science and Technology.\\n This submission includes four research themes:\\n Data Science\\n With funding from BBSRC, Royal Society (Newton Advanced Fellowship), British Council and\\n Innovate UK, data science research develops interdisciplinary methods, frameworks, algorithms\\n and systems to enable the extraction of knowledge from the integrative analysis of structured\\n and unstructured data. Our research concerns data science fundamentals and the application of\\n cutting-edge technologies in big data, machine learning/deep learning, AI, natural language\\n processing, governance and security. The impact of our research on social network analysis,\\n data science and AI in Pakistan is in impact case study (reference: ICS 3).\\n Machine Intelligence\\n Machine intelligence research explores the design and application of biologically and\\n linguistically motivated computational paradigms (e.g. conversational agents, natural language\\n                                                                                                Page 1\\n\\n\\n systems, robotics and synthetic biology), computational intelligence, adaptive psychological\\n profiling and human-computer interaction. This group is investigating the ethical, social and legal\\n dimensions of AI through place-based research, working with policy think tanks and local and\\n national government and community stakeholders (ICS 1). Research is funded by the European\\n Commission and Innovate UK. This group provides academic leadership for the GM AI Foundry.\\n Smart Infrastructure\\n Smart infrastructure research focuses on the increasing demands of digital transformation and\\n Industry 4.0. Researchers investigate future network and computation (e.g. 5G and 6G),\\n intelligent transport, connected healthcare, Internet of Things and smart cities. Research leads\\n to the development of tools and methodologies that address challenges in cybersecurity, privacy\\n and computer forensics (ICS 2). Funding comes from industrial partners and Innovate UK. This\\n group provides research leadership for the GM Cyber Foundry.\\n Human-Centred Computing\\n Research focuses on computer image and video analysis, visual computing, augmented/virtual\\n reality, serious games and approaches to empower individuals to take better control of their\\n data. Projects funded by The Royal Society, Cancer Research UK, EPSRC and Innovate UK are\\n concerned with ageing and the use of virtual cosmetics. Interdisciplinary collaboration is leading\\n to new innovations for the detection and amelioration of conditions such as dementia and\\n diabetes, human motion analysis for rehabilitation and serious games for the development and\\n understanding of healthcare issues.\\n Review of plans and objectives from REF2014\\n REF2014 Objective 1 - Cohesion and Communication\\n Our major objective in 2014 was to strengthen core areas of research and to encourage\\n interdisciplinary activities. CfACS has provided the leadership to achieve this primary objective.\\n We have built critical mass with a large uplift in the volume of staff and outputs, increased\\n quality, and fostered interdisciplinary research. Research cohesion has been strengthened\\n through significant investment and the career development of staff (Section 2).\\n REF2014 Objective 2 – Key themes\\n We have continued to collaborate with high-quality partners in the delivery of technology that is\\n important to the wider economy and society. Research in AI, cybersecurity and big data aligns to\\n ‘future and emerging technologies’ and are important themes in the Government’s R&D\\n ambitions. We have built on strengths in AI and Digital Health with industrial partners, NHS\\n Trusts and healthcare academics. For example, the development of AI-enabled technology for\\n the early detection of diabetic foot ulcers has led to clinical trials expected to deliver significant\\n patient benefits and cost savings (see output reference: 2354).\\n REF2014 Objective 3 – Facilitation\\n We aimed to enhance the quality of research by securing increased levels of external funding\\n and through additional investment in the development of staff. We have achieved increased\\n value of competitive awards over the assessment period winning £5.27m from prestigious\\n funders (EPSRC, STFC, BBSRC, Innovate UK, The Royal Society, Cancer Research UK,\\n H2020). We have also captured significant knowledge exchange funding to transfer research\\n excellence into impact through the award of ERDF funds for the AI Foundry and Cyber Foundry.\\n REF2014 Objective 4 – Public engagement leading to impact\\n We have curated innovative and popular Manchester Science Festival events characterised by a\\n deep understanding of best practice that go well beyond ‘top down’ dissemination formats. In\\n 2018, we developed an immersive theatre experience that put AI ‘on trial’ in the Manchester\\n Police Museum and in 2019; we delivered an event around public attitudes to AI. The results of\\n these activities are informing our forward strategy and the development of initiatives such as the\\n Greater Manchester Charter for Ethical AI.\\n                                                                                                    Page 2\\n\\n\\n Strategy for the next ten years\\n Our future strategy aims to enhance research excellence, targets the delivery of global impacts,\\n encourages the development of new areas of intellectual leadership and increases opportunities\\n for commercial development. We will achieve this by supporting a collaborative and inclusive\\n research culture; inspiring support for future research leaders and promoting our world-leading\\n research.\\n Investing in People: We are continuously strengthening our themes by investing in high-quality\\n staff that understand our ethos and are passionate about our mission. We will focus on\\n expanding the equality and diversity of staff and have ambitions to create a gender-balanced\\n research centre. We support our ECRs to become future leaders with continued mentoring and\\n access to development programmes (Section 2). We will expand national and international\\n collaboration linked to strengths in AI, data science, and cyber security.\\n Sustaining excellence: We have an important role in helping businesses to recover from Covid-\\n 19. The impact of our research on the technological advancement and productivity of SMEs and\\n its link to the future skills agenda will be critical for Greater Manchester. We will develop a\\n ‘Research Institute for Future AI’ that will support the rapid and extensive uptake of AI-enabled\\n technology. Our work will be at the forefront of efforts to promote an ethical approach to AI, and\\n we will embed this approach across disciplines and sectors for the achievement of positive\\n economic and societal impacts. Postgraduate researchers are vital for the sustainability of our\\n research, and we will embed them into the full range of our activities so they are well prepared\\n and equipped for their future careers.\\n Engagement = Impact: Collaboration is vital for our intellectual and financial sustainability and is\\n the key mechanism for delivering economic and societal impact. We anticipate that future\\n funding will go to interdisciplinary projects that can harness the collective knowledge of diverse\\n teams of researchers, industrial partners and communities. The sustainable partnerships that we\\n are developing through our KTP pipeline and large-scale KE initiatives will ensure we play an\\n important role in these emerging opportunities. We will set ambitious targets for the growth of\\n research awards and deliver impacts with a global resonance.\\n Enabling impact\\n CfACS has an Impact and Engagement Manager who helps staff to embed impact across\\n research activities. The Impact Manager works with a group of seven KE members whose focus\\n is on the translation of research into activities that lead to impact.\\n We have an outstanding KTP portfolio supported by an award-winning team. In the assessment\\n period we have secured £2.3m for 17 KTPs that have transformed the productivity of North West\\n SMEs. We have delivered KTPs across all research themes, but they have played a particularly\\n important role as pathway to impact in cybersecurity (see ICS 2). Staff who act as KTP\\n supervisors are rewarded by a 10% workload allocation throughout the duration of their project.\\n Staff are supported by MetroPolis, the University’s research-led think tank (see REF 5a).\\n MetroPolis links our research into policy and provides funding for roundtable events and\\n resources that have helped us to respond to parliamentary enquiries.\\n Internal funding supports impact. Prof Liangxiu Han accessed £30,000 to develop drone\\n technology, which led to field trials to protect food crops from disease in China. Global\\n Challenges Research Funding (GCRF) is used for impact. For example, Dr Nawaz used GCRF\\n to support activities around gender-based violence in Pakistan (see ICS 3).\\n We collaborate closely with NHS Trusts on technology-enabled healthcare. For example, we are\\n working with the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust on AI applications for pathology and with the\\n Salford Royal Foundation Trust on AI for Health and Social Care.\\n                                                                                                 Page 3\\n\\n\\n Support for impact will continue after REF 2021. Our Impact and Engagement Manager is\\n already working with staff to make plans for the areas where we want to develop future benefits.\\n Interdisciplinary research\\n Our research structures and strategies encourage staff from different disciplines to undertake\\n collaborative research that would otherwise not be possible. We have a particular strength in\\n research that is at the interface of informatics, health and agritech, and our outputs report many\\n collaborations with healthcare providers and international partners. 30% of the outputs included\\n in the submission are interdisciplinary.\\n Examples include collaboration with ecologists on early warning systems which led to co-funded\\n work with the EPSRC (output 2347), an exploration into the decision-making processes of\\n physiotherapists that led to a large MRC grant on neuromuscular control in children (output\\n 2367) and research on machine learning with psychologists and media professionals. We have\\n won £955,000 from the BBSRC, EPSRC and Innovate UK for international interdisciplinary\\n research in precision agriculture with botanists from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the\\n Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International.\\n Open research\\n Our open access policy is fully compliant with REF requirements and 90% of our in-scope\\n outputs are fully open access compliant (without exceptions). Staff have access to resources for\\n both green and gold open access (see REF 5a). Our institutional repository currently includes\\n 700 items associated with CfACS. Some of the most downloaded work is on traffic-management\\n systems and interdisciplinary collaborations on micro-facial expressions, wrinkles and ageing\\n (over 1,000 downloads). We have UKRI and institutional funding available for article processing\\n charges as well as arrangements with various publishers such as an IEEE Deposit Account.\\n Twenty-two outputs were made immediately available through Gold Open Access resources\\n including impactful research on health informatics and data science.\\n We are fully compliant with the Concordat for Open Research Data, adhere closely to funder\\n policies and seek to make research data accessible and useful to others. Staff share their data\\n using the University repository (see REF 5a), and there are examples of the use of GitHub and\\n other systems to create datasets that have a big impact. For example, in output 2354 we report\\n the creation of the world’s largest dataset for the medical imaging of diabetic foot ulcers used by\\n over 50 institutions from 25 countries.\\n Research Integrity and Ethics\\n Researchers are aware of their responsibilities under the revised Concordat for Research\\n Integrity. Our unit has 3 ethics leads (Prof Han, Dr Yap and Dr Kharel) who represent computer\\n science at the Faculty Research Ethics and Governance Committee. All staff, PGRs and taught\\n students obtain ethical approval before commencing any data collection. Ethical approval is\\n managed through EthOS (see REF 5a). Our Research Ethics and Governance Manager\\n provides training and guidance and has expertise in healthcare-related research.\\n We participate in annual audits of compliance with the institutional expectations around research\\n ethics and governance. We are fortunate to have staff who provide academic leadership for\\n ethics across Computer Science disciplines. In 2019, Prof Crockett co-organised a special\\n session at the IEEE CEC on the Ethics of Computational Intelligence and in 2020, she co-\\n chaired a panel and workshop on Ethical AI at IEEE WCCI.\\n 2. People\\n Staffing strategy\\n Our staffing strategy is to attract high-quality researchers and to provide support to enable staff\\n to achieve their full potential. We have invested in staff development and infrastructure. This has\\n underpinned a large growth in critical mass and the number of staff included in our submission\\n has increased by 100% from 11.5 FTE in REF 2014 to 23 FTE in 2021. Our recruitment policy\\n                                                                                                Page 4\\n\\n\\n emphasises the importance of high-quality research, we have workload processes that\\n incentivise and reward good performance, staff development and training initiatives that\\n underline our commitment to the Concordat for the Career Development of Researchers,\\n support for early career researchers, and clear research-based academic pathways and\\n promotion routes.\\n Recruitment\\n We work closely with Heads of Departments and Faculty planners to recruit into areas of\\n expertise. The Director of CfACS and our theme leads are included in recruitment processes to\\n ensure that candidates meet our requirements for both quality and ‘fit’. Beyond like-for-like\\n replacement, recruitment is driven by our strategic plans. We have demonstrated world\\n leadership and reputation in specific areas and are using this leverage to attract new talent. The\\n reputation and profile of our research is evidenced by the fact that we attract high quality from an\\n international talent pool and we regularly receive a high volume of applications from around the\\n world. Principles of equality, diversity and inclusion are embedded throughout our recruitment\\n processes.\\n A series of new appointments has underpinned a growth in critical mass in all core areas.\\n Twelve staff were recruited during the assessment period including two professors (Profs Peng\\n and Aspin) and five early career researchers (Cavaliere, Drikvandi, Cunningham, Moretti and\\n Shardlow).\\n Our recruitment strategy in combination with staff development activities (see below) has led to a\\n large increase in overall research capacity, as reflected in our staffing contract profile (Table 1).\\n   Professor                      Reader               Senior Lecturer         Lecturer, Research\\n                                                                               Fellow\\n   17%                            26%                  48%                     9%\\n Table 1: Staff contract level profile\\n All of our submitted staff are on permanent employment contracts. 22% of our staff are ECRs.\\n Staff development and progression\\n We provide time for colleagues to engage in a minimum of ten days professional development\\n each year. We organise a vibrant programme of ongoing activity including seminars where staff\\n (including ECRs and PGRs) share findings and build collaborative networks. The University is a\\n signatory to the revised Concordat for Career Development of Researchers and has held the EU\\n HR Excellence in Research award for eight years (see REF 5a).\\n Workload allocation\\n All staff with a significant responsibility receive a minimum of 20% of their time allocation for\\n research and are full members of CfACS in line with our approved Code of Practice. Our\\n members have access to internal funds to produce high-quality outputs. They generate research\\n income, supervise PhDs and mentor ECRs.\\n Pay and career progression\\n Colleagues at the top of Grade 8, 9 or 10 (Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Reader) can apply for\\n additional increments to reward excellent research or impact activities. Professors have their pay\\n reviewed annually to provide the flexibility to reward outstanding contributions and retain our top\\n performers.\\n Promotion from Lecturer to Professor is delivered through two Academic Career Pathways:\\n Education, Pedagogy and Citizenship and Research, Knowledge Exchange, Impact, Education\\n and Citizenship. In the assessment period, five staff (22% of our submission) were promoted for\\n their contribution to the production of high-quality outputs and impact. This includes promotions\\n from Reader to Professor for Han, Crockett and Hammoudeh and from Senior Lecturer to\\n Reader for Yap and Kharel.\\n                                                                                                 Page 5\\n\\n\\n Mentoring and individual research plans\\n Mentoring from research leaders is a key part of our culture. All ECRs are assigned a mentor\\n who can help with their career development. Mentors provide input into the development of\\n individual research plans, publications and grant applications. Information from individual\\n research plans feeds into departmental professional development reviews (PDRs), ensuring that\\n individual research supports departmental strategies and goals.\\n Induction\\n All new staff (including ECRs) undertake an induction program, providing critical knowledge on\\n research conduct, integrity and ethics, the use of RKE Systems, health and safety, procurement\\n and grant management. Institutional training is provided on PhD supervision, postgraduate\\n examining and chairing assessment panels and our equality and diversity policies. All new\\n starters have a reduced workload during their probation period, with a 25% uplift in preparation\\n time for units taught in their first year at the University.\\n Our postdoctoral research associates (PDRA) and KTP associates are members of the UCRKE\\n and engage with seminars, training, funding and other aspects of research culture. They are\\n supported by the PDR system, are allocated mentors and are able to access internal funds to\\n attend conferences and research networking meetings in the same way as other staff.\\n Early career researchers\\n We currently have five ECRS (22% of our overall submission) who were all appointed during the\\n assessment cycle. ECRs are assigned a mentor and complete an individual research plan.\\n We have a number of internal funding schemes and training programmes to support the career\\n development of ECRs including Research Accelerator Grants and RKE Future Leaders. The\\n CfACS management structure includes a dedicated ECR Lead (Prof Crockett) who represents\\n our ECRs at an institutional ECR forum. Prof Crockett organises an annual ECR Showcase to\\n raise the profile of individuals and their research areas. We have an excellent record of\\n supporting ECRs to achieve their full potential, and we see this as a distinctive feature of our\\n culture. For example, Dr Yap was appointed as a lecturer in 2011 and was returned as an ECR\\n in REF 2014. She was promoted to senior lecturer in 2014, and subsequent participation in our\\n Future Leaders scheme helped her to develop larger funding applications such as the Royal\\n Society Industry Fellowship that she was awarded in 2016. This activity led to promotion to\\n Reader in 2017. Dr Yap is now benefitting from the University’s Good to Great programme that\\n is designed for advanced career development and progression.\\n Internal investment and support for professional development\\n We provide staff with access to resources to pursue their ideas and a range of internally funding\\n opportunities for career development.\\n Funding for conferences and events: CfACS members including ECRs and PGRs have access\\n to funding to attend international and national networking events and conferences, to run\\n workshops, to invite external speakers and for knowledge exchange and public engagement\\n activities.\\n Writing Retreats: CfACS organises a biannual writing retreat that has provided staff at all career\\n stages (including ECRs and PGRs) with mutual help and support in developing their personal\\n publication strategies and outputs.\\n Seed funding for the development of new activities: Staff can apply for seed funding (up to\\n £10,000) to develop RKE activities. This has been used variously to purchase equipment, to pay\\n for the costs of visiting research partners, to access external facilities and to support activity that\\n can leverage new funding opportunities and generate high-quality outputs or impact.\\n                                                                                                  Page 6\\n\\n\\n Sabbatical arrangements: Staff have access time and resources for sabbaticals that have been\\n used to support high-quality work. For example, Prof Hammoudeh’s sabbatical helped him to\\n develop a strong collaboration with Lab-STICC CNRS, Université De Bretagne\\n Occidentale, France, and Al-Balqaʼ Applied University, Jordan. This led to the creation of the\\n world\\'s first simulator for smart city digital twin and the production of over 10 publications. Dr Yap\\n used a sabbatical to establish new collaborations with University of Waikato. This led to an\\n EPSRC funding award (EP/N02700/1) and an international workshop in conjunction with\\n MICCAI.\\n Research Accelerator Grants: CfACS staff have been able to access research accelerator grants\\n (see REF 5a) to collect preliminary data for proof of the concept and feasibility. Staff have used\\n the funds to develop capacity in software agents and big data analyses.\\n Global Challenges Research Funding: GCRF is used to develop overseas links with a particular\\n emphasis on support for impact-related activities. Prof Han and Dr Nawaz have used £12,000 of\\n GCRF to extend partnerships around crop disease and gender-based violence in China and\\n Pakistan, respectively.\\n RKE Future Leaders Scheme: CfACS has five RKE Future Leaders (Yap, Latham, Dhajel,\\n Hammoudeh and Kharel) who have benefited from this scheme. Participants are selected\\n through a competitive application process and are given a £5,000 personal development\\n allowance and time allocation to attend the cohort-based learning opportunity. RKE Future\\n Leaders has helped Yap, Hammoudeh and Kharel to secure promotions during the assessment\\n period.\\n Good to Great (G2G): G2G is a competitive development scheme that provides an advanced\\n level of career development for staff who are moving towards the highest levels of academic\\n leadership. Each G2G participant undertakes a needs analysis that informs their learning\\n pathway. They receive internal and external mentorship and are able to access considerable\\n funds for personal and professional development. Dr Yap received £35,000 and teaching relief\\n that enabled her to participate in a series of funding sandpits that led to a successful award from\\n Cancer Research UK and EPSRC.\\n Strategic Opportunities Funding (SOF): SOF provides strategic investment into areas of growth\\n that align with our research ambitions. In 2018, we invested £65,000 for Prof Hammoudeh to\\n produce a prototype system for cybersecurity in the pharmaceutical supply chain (see ICS 2),\\n and Prof Han accessed £30,000 to extend field trials around agritech solutions for crop disease\\n in China (output 2363).\\n Staff exchange mechanisms\\n We have funded mechanisms in place to facilitate staff exchanges including the International\\n Visitor and Research Network Fund that staff use to develop strategic collaborations with\\n overseas partners. Dr Nawaz used the funding for a partnership with the National Centre for\\n Artificial Intelligence in Pakistan, and Dr Dhajel developed links with the University of Rennes\\n around research into smart transportation.\\n We also have a number of visiting professorships which staff use to develop new, externally\\n funded collaborations. For example, Prof Ana Fernández Vilas (University of Vigo) visited staff in\\n the Machine Intelligence group in 2018. This led to the successful award of the €64,600 grant\\n Magos (Secure sMArt Grid using Open Source Intelligence) funded by the Ministerio De\\n Economia, Industria Y Competividad, and joint supervision of a PhD student (output 2352).\\n 2.4 Research students\\n Strategy\\n                                                                                                  Page 7\\n\\n\\n Postgraduate Research Students (PGRs) are a vital part of our research community. Our\\n strategy highlights the importance of PGR quality and allocates funding to provide in-depth\\n personalised support to develop our PGRs’ research skills and career development.\\n A proportion of our UCRKE budget is ring-fenced to support PGR activities. In the 2019\\n Postgraduate Research Environment Survey (PRES) we were in the top quartile for the quality\\n of our supervision, and we have delivered 34 doctoral completions in the assessment period – a\\n 113% increase on REF 2014.\\n Recruitment and funding\\n Eighty students have enrolled with CfACS during the assessment period, and we currently have\\n a diverse community of 40 PGRs recruited from all over the world including China, Saudi,\\n Malaysia, India, Iran, France and Spain. CfACS leads the advertising, recruitment and\\n appointment process to ensure that we attract the right candidates. All PGRs are interviewed by\\n a gender-balanced panel who have completed equality and diversity training including a\\n mandatory module on unconscious bias. Our commitment to individual circumstances is\\n reflected in our PGR community. Fifteen percent of our PGR students have declared a disability,\\n 29% are female and 46% identify as Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME).\\n Studentships are funded from external and internal sources. We have been successful in\\n winning competitive funding such as the Royal Society PhD Studentship for Industry Fellows in\\n 2017 when we were awarded £86,000 for a joint studentship with Image Metrics (output 2339).\\n We were also the first modern University to win the EPSRC Dorothy Hodgson Postgraduate\\n Award to support research on the detection of glaucoma (output 2342). PhD student Dr Haleem\\n was selected as a finalist under the Transforming Society category in the UK ICT pioneer\\n competition 2015 as a result of this project. We have received full funding for studentships from\\n Service Power and matched funding from partners such as Intellicentrics and IBM (output 2385).\\n We are also able to access fully funded Vice-Chancellor Scholarships which are advertised on\\n an annual basis in high-profile global campaigns.\\n Monitoring and support\\n PGRs have a minimum of two academic supervisors including a Director of Studies who\\n supports the development of the student’s research including access to training and career\\n development opportunities. One hundred hours of annual supervision is usually divided between\\n the supervisory team.\\n The SkillsForge system supports student progress and development (see REF 5a). SkillsForge\\n generates automatic reminders about official milestones and records training and actions from\\n supervisory meetings. An Application for Registration takes place after three months (for full-time\\n study) and a Progression Review or Transfer of Registration takes place after 12 months full-\\n time). All PGRs are expected to submit within four years (pro-rata for PT students).\\n The most recent (2019) results of the Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES)\\n evidence our strong support for PGRs. We were ranked within the top quartile for the quality of\\n supervision in the Computer Science and Informatics category with 100% of respondents\\n reporting that they had regular contact with supervisors that was appropriate for their needs. We\\n have delivered 34 successful doctoral completions during the assessment period.\\n PGR Support and Training\\n All PGRs automatically become members of CfACS, which gives them access to funding,\\n research-focused events and the opportunity to contribute to our collaborative research culture.\\n We run a bi-weekly seminar series that integrates PGRs into our wider mission. A departmental\\n Research Degree Co-ordinator is assigned to provide dedicated support to PGR students.\\n CfACS has a PGR representative (Prof Crockett) who provides an opportunity for the PGR voice\\n to be heard and understood in CfACS meetings.\\n                                                                                              Page 8\\n\\n\\n We work with the University’s Graduate School to provide training for PGRs (see REF 5a).\\n CfACS hosts away days where we discuss research, career development and practical and\\n theoretical techniques. We encourage PGR students to join professional societies to develop\\n their academic networks, and we signpost opportunities to get involved in public engagement\\n activities, present at conferences, and encourage PGR representation on committees. For\\n example, 10 PhD students were involved in the 2018 and 2019 Manchester Science Festivals\\n supporting our events on AI. PGRs in their second and third year are encouraged to act as\\n mentors to new students. Regular teaching opportunities are available with the process de-\\n coupled from the Director of Studies in order to provide a range of academic experience and\\n viewpoints. PGRs have access to lockers, staff common rooms and desks, with the majority\\n using university laptops to allow flexible working.\\n Dr Ryan Cunningham provides a good ‘case study’ of how we support PGRs and how this, in\\n turn, feeds back into our research environment. In 2012, Ryan was awarded a fully funded PhD\\n studentship on a collaborative project with healthcare scientists. Following a successful\\n completion, we were able to offer a research fellowship in Healthcare Science and afterwards a\\n lectureship in Computing. As part of his development, we have been able to provide\\n approximately £20,000 internal funding for Dr Cunningham to attend conferences and to\\n purchase research equipment. In 2019, Ryan’s work with musculoskeletal scientists was\\n awarded £900,000 from the Medical Research Council (output 2383).\\n 2.5 Equality and Diversity\\n We have made progress in improving equality and diversity with a particular emphasis on\\n addressing levels of gender and ethnic representation at senior roles. The equality and diversity\\n of our submitted staff against the total eligible population is included in Table 2 below.\\n   Protected                  % of submitted           % of staff in overall eligible\\n   characteristic             staff (REF 2021)         population (REF 2021)\\n   Female                     17%                      13%\\n   Male                       83%                      87%\\n   Declared disability        0%                       5%\\n   White                      61%                      73%\\n   Total BAME                 39%                      27%\\n   Black                      0%                       0%\\n   Chinese                    13%                      7%\\n   Asian                      17%                      15%\\n   Mixed / Other              9%                       5%\\n Table 2: Equality characteristics of staff against the total eligible population.\\n Our submission is more representative then the total eligible population with more women\\n included in the return and more staff who identify as BAME. We are more representative than\\n the sector average in terms of ethnicity (39% of staff identify as BAME whereas the average\\n according to the latest HESA data for academic staff in relevant disciplines is 25%). Fifty percent\\n of our professors are female and all of our research themes are led by women. Three out of four\\n professors identify as BAME (compared with nil in REF 2014).\\n We have inspirational leaders of the sector’s approach to equality and diversity. Prof Crockett is\\n Chair of the IEEE Women in Computational Intelligence Committee and Chair of IEEE Task\\n Force on Ethical and Social Implications of Computational Intelligence. In 2019, Prof Crockett\\n was tagged as a “Woman to Watch” (IEEE Women in Engineering Magazine), and in 2020 she\\n was shortlisted as one of the 100 most influential women in UK Technology by Computer\\n Weekly. Dr Latham is currently the Chair of IEEE UK and Ireland Women in Engineering\\n Committee (serving since 2012) and is a committee member of IEEE Women in Computational\\n Intelligence.\\n                                                                                               Page 9\\n\\n\\n CfACS makes a contribution to the University’s equality and diversity agenda. We provided\\n leadership for activities that underpinned the award of Athena SWAN Bronze, and Dr Latham is\\n currently leading a team of academics, technicians and PGRs assembling an application for a\\n departmental submission.\\n Flexible working arrangements\\n Our flexible working procedure facilitates temporary part-time working, compressed hours, job\\n share, and career breaks, combined with a promotions scheme to ensure that colleagues are not\\n disadvantaged by career breaks (see REF 5a). We recognise the effect that equality-related\\n circumstances can have on an individual’s ability to research or on their productivity. Following\\n disclosure of an equality-related issue, we adjust our expectations for the production of research.\\n ECR colleagues have reduced expectations of research outputs.\\n Part-time and fixed-term staff have access to the same support and progression systems as full-\\n time staff including PDR, career development funds and opportunities. Additional training to\\n gaining academic qualifications is made available to all.\\n Support for staff and research students returning from leave\\n We have policies in place to support staff who are returning from leave or other long-term family\\n absence. We have a generous annual leave allowance with enhanced maternal, paternal and\\n adoption leave in addition to unpaid parental leave if required. We make adjustments for\\n colleagues with caring responsibilities; those with chronic disabilities; and those returning to\\n work after a period of sickness or leave of family-related absence (see REF 5a).\\n The wellbeing of staff and research students\\n All staff have access to the Lifeworks portal for counselling, confidential advice and support for\\n personal issues. Lifeworks is a fully integrated wellbeing platform that provides everyone access\\n to discounts and wellbeing assistance seamlessly via website and a mobile app. Regular\\n meetings with mentors and research theme leaders help us to identify staff that might need to be\\n signposted to support where appropriate.\\n Equality and Diversity and our REF 2021 return\\n In the process of preparing for REF 2021, the Unit of Assessment coordination team aimed to be\\n fair, transparent and inclusive, following the processes set out in our University’s Code of\\n Practice, which we have used to guide decisions around our submission. All colleagues with\\n significant responsibility for research are included in the submission. All staff involved in unit of\\n assessment co-ordination have completed training on ‘Managing Diversity’, ‘Equality and\\n Diversity Essentials’ and ‘Unconscious Bias and REF2021’.\\n All colleagues have been made aware of the processes surrounding requests for a reduction in\\n output expectations, and adjustments in expectations have been made where appropriate. We\\n studied EDAP’s guidance closely and decided that we could manage the cumulative effect on\\n our submission within the revised rules and therefore did not request a reduction in the number\\n of outputs.\\n We have paid particular attention to ensuring that equality and diversity are embedded into the\\n development and preparation of the submission. The Computer Science and Informatics\\n REF2021 Coordination Group featured one male and three female colleagues. We have taken\\n positive steps to share the attribution of outputs: 26% of the outputs are attributed to females\\n despite the fact that there are only 17% female staff in the overall submission.\\n 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n 3.1 Income\\n                                                                                                Page 10\\n\\n\\n Strategic investment in staff including development schemes as well as excellent support from\\n our Research Development Managers has resulted in 51 external research awards totalling\\n £5.26m. We have also secured significant knowledge exchange awards, principally for the GM\\n Cyber Foundry and AI Foundry projects (see below).\\n Research income is £3.58m (156% larger than the £1.4m we reported in REF 2014) with funding\\n from BBSRC, EPSRC, MRC, Royal Society, European Commission, Innovate UK and industrial\\n collaborators. There has been a sustained uplift in external income from 2013/14 (£142,000) to\\n 2019/20 (£863,000).\\n The scope of our funding portfolio remains diverse with 21% from UK Research Councils\\n (EPSRC and BBSRC are our main UKRI sources of income) and 15% from European Funders\\n (see table 3 below).

Experienced researchers are encouraged to bid more\\n selectively, for larger grants. Robust peer review processes, starting with formal CfACS-level\\n support and scrutiny, enhance the quality of bids and share expertise across the staff team.\\n A careful pathway of mentoring and support for ECRs: We support ECRs to identify\\n opportunities, write convincing cases for support and conduct rigorous peer review and\\n mentoring activities. We also provide internal investment through RKE Future Leaders and\\n Research Accelerator Grants.\\n Playing our part in the Industrial Strategy and future economy: We have won large awards\\n for knowledge exchange projects that translate research in cyber security and AI into tangible\\n benefits for the region’s economy and workforce. Our research and teaching nexus provides a\\n fantastic opportunity for us to feed research-led innovations into a new way of doing things\\n across Greater Manchester. Our large and expanding KTP portfolio is enabling us to translate\\n new ideas into impact that benefits North West SMEs, and we will continue to grow this activity\\n into the future.\\n Using knowledge of funders more strategically: Regular bidding workshops across\\n disciplines share specific funder knowledge. We have used this experience to work alongside\\n our Research Development Manager to provide critical appraisal of proposals throughout. This\\n has been a successful approach for us with BBSRC funding and with Royal Society funding in\\n particular.\\n Internal investment to support external income: As reported in section 2 we use internal\\n funding to support early-stage ideas from our staff. Schemes such as the Strategic Opportunities\\n Fund (SOF) and Research Accelerator Grants are used with precision to pump prime activities\\n that have been worked up into full external proposals. For example, Dr Yap has been able to use\\n internal investment to grow her research team and to develop collaborations with Image Metrics\\n Ltd (output 2339) and CSols Ltd into successful awards from The Royal Society (£146,381) and\\n Innovate UK (£218,486). This has resulted in more than 30 high-quality publications.\\n The development of new clusters of expertise: We have invested in the development of\\n significant new clusters of activity during the assessment period such as “Precision Agriculture”.\\n With £30,000 internal support from the SOF and GCRF, Prof Han has constructed a portfolio of\\n precision agriculture solutions for crop health management and monitoring, soil analysis and\\n crop site management, which has generated more than £900,000 to Manchester Metropolitan\\n and resulted in eight high-quality research papers.\\n                                                                                            Page 12\\n\\n\\n Exceptional support from the RKE Directorate: We have a strong relationship with our\\n Research Development Manager, who attends management meetings and works with us on\\n long-term funding strategy.

      "['Nottingham Trent University (NTU)\\n Unit of Assessment: B11 - Computer Science and Informatics\\n 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n The Computer Science and Informatics Unit of Assessment (UoA) at NTU is a highly\\n interdisciplinary UoA that delivers theoretically grounded and determinedly impactful research\\n that enables us to bring multiple computer science approaches to bear on issues of societal\\n concern. Our research coalesces under the theme of ‘Enabling Digital Technology’ and extends\\n to the following areas: health and wellbeing; physical rehabilitation; care of the elderly; education\\n through personalised learning systems; and intelligent transportation systems. Our\\n collaborations involve industrial partners across 18 countries, sharing our vision of bringing\\n together advanced technologies and digital systems to create smart innovative services and\\n intelligent business models for our end-user communities.\\n Building on the strengths documented in RAE2001/2008 and REF2014, we have created a vital\\n and sustainable research environment with significant levels of growth. Notable achievements\\n for this UoA include:\\n      \\uf0b7   grant income spend has increased to £3.06M in REF2021 from £1.26M in REF2014;\\n      \\uf0b7   PhD completions have more than doubled to 34 in REF2021 compared to 14 in\\n          REF2014; and\\n      \\uf0b7   414 outputs have been published with 84.8% in Q1 journals by SNIP and 62% with\\n          international co-authorship (Scopus/SciVal, 2014-2020).\\n 1.1 The UoA’s research structures\\n Professor David Brown is the Director of the UoA’s Computing and Informatics Research Centre\\n (CIRC), which is based within NTU’s School of Science and Technology (SST). Alongside\\n Brown are Dr Colin Wilmott as Research Coordinator and Deputy Director and Professor\\n Ahmad Lotfi as Head of the Department of Computer Science. Research leadership is provided\\n by the Centre’s Research Advisory Group, which is responsible for developing and implementing\\n our research strategy. CIRC comprises 14 research academics, 2 independent research fellows,\\n 35 post-doctoral and PhD researchers across four Research Groups: Interactive Systems (IS);\\n Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Robotics (CNCR); Computational Intelligence and\\n Applications (CIA); and, Network Infrastructures, Computing and Cyber Security (NICCS). Each\\n Research Group is led by two senior researchers (e.g., a professor and an associate professor)\\n to ensure expertise and sustainability. Since 2014, NTU has invested in an Associate Dean for\\n Research (ADR) in every academic school who mentors group leads. As a member of both the\\n University Research Committee and the University Leadership Team, this role links the UoA\\n directly to the strategic decision making of the University. SST provides a Postgraduate\\n Researcher Tutor who supports PhD student recruitment, selection, and training, as well as\\n supervisor training. CIRC also engages with NTU’s five strategic research themes (see REF5a)\\n which bring together researchers from across disciplines to address key societal challenges as\\n outlined in Section 1.3 on interdisciplinarity.\\n                           Figure 1: Research Group structure within the UoA\\n                                                                                                Page 1\\n\\n\\n 1.2 Research and Impact strategy\\n 1.2.1 Achievement of REF2014 research strategy\\n The UoA reviewed its research objectives at the start of this REF period before embarking on an\\n ambitious strategy to realise our Enabling Digital Technology vision. Highlight metrics include:\\n     \\uf0b7 £3.06M in grant income spend, representing a 155% increase over REF 2014;\\n     \\uf0b7 34 PhD completions, representing a 143% growth;\\n     \\uf0b7 414 scholarly outputs co-authored by UoA members, with 84.8% in Q1 journals by SNIP\\n         and the majority having at least one international co-author (Scopus/SciVal 2014-2020);\\n         and\\n     \\uf0b7 15 keynote speeches, 4 visiting professorships, participation on 20 journal editorial\\n         boards, 5 conference prizes, hosting of 6 international conferences and membership of\\n         16 research funding panels.\\n Our strategy was to enhance the quality of colleagues’ contributions in world class facilities, thus\\n growing our portfolio of grant income from high-quality sources. Strategic investments in people,\\n buildings and equipment, and utilisation of enlarged key University teams (Section 3.2), including\\n Research Operations (RO) and Research and Strategic Partnership Development (RSPD), have\\n driven a step-change in the UoA’s research environment since REF2014. In REF2014 (REF5),\\n we undertook:\\n     1.  To address societal needs with ubiquitous computing research, increase user\\n         engagement, diversify our funding portfolio, and grow our research base\\n   This REF period has seen the formation of CIRC where our Enabling Digital Technology vision\\n   has focused on applying computational research to areas of societal concern (Sections 1.2.2\\n   and 1.2.3).This has inspired a virtuous circle from innovation through to implementation, user\\n   engagement and impact, leading directly to high levels of grant capture from prestigious\\n   sources.\\n              Table 1: Data on income and PhD completions\\n                                                      REF2014             2014-2021\\n                 Grant Income Spend                    £1.2M               £3.06M\\n                 PhD Completions                         14                  34\\n     2.  To conduct interdisciplinary research and partnerships\\n  Investments in state-of the-art, interdisciplinary research facilities have pioneered new research\\n  areas and facilitated interdisciplinary research. These include: the £11M Interdisciplinary\\n  Science and Technology (ISTeC) facility for integrating computational techniques with cognate\\n  disciplines for applications to the real-world; and the £0.5M SmartNTU House facility (Section\\n  3.3). Examples of consequent interdisciplinary research encompass CNCR’s SiElegans project\\n  and NICCS’s REMOURBAN project involving 21 partners (Section 3.1). More recent\\n  investments, such as with Medical Technology Innovation Facility (MTIF) and Smart Wireless\\n  Innovation Facility (SWIFt) continue this trend of interdisciplinary research into the next REF\\n  cycle (Section 3.3).\\n     3.  To recruit and nurture excellent research staff and students\\n  Investment has strengthened senior leadership in CIRC with new professors and associate\\n  professors. Given sector challenges in recruitment, the development of early career\\n  researchers has been supported through two appointments under the SST Early Career\\n  Independent Research Fellowship (IRF) Scheme and through four academic associates who\\n  conduct PhD studies alongside a part-time teaching position (Section 2).\\n                                                                                               Page 2\\n\\n\\n     4.    To increase our national and international profile for research excellence\\n   Our external collaboration evidences our increased profile with nearly three quarters of our\\n   outputs having external collaborators. Staff in CIRC are now involved in a range of high-profile\\n   activities beyond NTU, from H2020 grant panel memberships to visiting professorships and\\n   delivering international summer schools in quantum computing (Section 4).\\n   5.      To improve our external standing in research strength and quality\\n   CIRC staff have maintained a record of publication in high-quality journals and the highest\\n   profile academic conferences, including IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, IEEE Internet of\\n   Things Journal, and IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.\\n 1.2.2 Achievement of REF2014 impact strategy\\n In REF2014 (REF3a), we aimed to: target wider engagement with end user communities;\\n influence government via our Research Centres, conferences, KTNs and equivalent networks;\\n embed the value and importance of impact into the foundations of our work; and engage in\\n consultancy and partnerships. These aims have been achieved across a range of initiatives set\\n out below.\\n We have developed impact with a range of end-user communities across all our research\\n activities (Section 4.2). This is exemplified by service users from Nottinghamshire MIND being\\n central to Brown’s EPSRC project to enable improved perceptions of mental wellbeing by\\n networked smart textile objects. Brown also engaged stakeholders across Europe, through two\\n H2020 funded projects (No One Left Behind and MaTHSiS), to improve the inclusion of students\\n with learning disabilities through accessible and adaptive learning technologies (REF3). As a\\n consequence, he has influenced government through giving oral evidence to the House of\\n Commons Education Select Committee in 2019 on the future of AI in the classroom (Section\\n 4.3). We have developed new end-user engagement through the award of three Innovate UK\\n projects; of particular note is Kanjo’s eNurture Project (TangToys) in partnership with the\\n Nottingham Schools’ Trust and the Ann Craft Trust.\\n In recognising the value and importance of impact, we have developed an extensive network of\\n partnerships within financial services, transportation, energy and education sectors with which\\n we have facilitated sustained knowledge transfer through explorations of new products and\\n services. Examples include Kanjo’s match-funded studentship with The Manufacturing\\n Technology Centre (Section 2.2.1), Peytchev’s REMOURBAN project involving 21 partners,\\n including local authorities and companies, and Wilmott’s quantum computing work with UK-\\n based banking institutions (Section 4.4).\\n Through our commitment to developing and strengthening partnerships with industry, we have\\n secured £0.8M competitive D2N2 Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) Local Growth Fund co-\\n funding to support the establishment of NTU’s new £1.6M Smart Wireless Innovation Facility\\n (SWIFt, Section 3.3). This will enable senior academics from CIRC to work ever more closely\\n with local businesses on the development and implementation of innovative 5G technology.\\n 1.2.3 Enabling, facilitating, and achieving impact\\n Building on the REF2014 strategy, CIRC has generated a range of sustainable mechanisms to\\n help incubate the best impact of our research at all stages. We have targeted resources,\\n including funds, studentships and sabbaticals, towards prioritising projects with planned impact\\n routes. This has included: practice-sharing workshops with RAND Europe; a ‘Fast Track Impact’\\n workshop by Prof Mark Reed; IP exploitation training by NTU’s Knowledge Exchange team; and,\\n funding for collaborative travel for all CIRC staff.\\n Examples of where investment has enabled impact include:\\n                                                                                              Page 3\\n\\n\\n     \\uf0b7  The realisation of the impact of Peytchev’s ‘Connected and Autonomous Vehicles i-\\n        Motors’ project with Control F1 was underpinned by a six-month research assistant (RA).\\n        This CIRC-funded RA provided critical stability of skills and expertise for impact\\n        development. The i-Motors project enabled a communication framework capable of\\n        improving autonomous vehicles’ awareness of surrounding traffic. It was described as\\n        ‘instrumental for development and economic impact’ (Dale Reed, Control F1) and has\\n        since generated £5M of economic impacts for Control F1 (see our Mobile Networking\\n        Case Study);\\n     \\uf0b7  The realisation of the impact of Brown’s co-creation project with Fujitsu and the\\n        subsequent co-development of the mobile app to improve the mental wellbeing of\\n        workers with autism, called ‘My-State’, was supported by a one-year RA. It was also\\n        underpinned by a formal strategic partnership between NTU and Fujitsu (see our\\n        Inclusive AI Learning Systems Case Study);\\n     \\uf0b7  Two NTU-funded RAs underpinned Lotfi’s research to assist regional companies to\\n        explore the use of emerging technologies within their business environment products.\\n        JustChecking Ltd deployed the group’s expertise in activity recognition and machine-\\n        learning for future product lines. Alcuris Ltd made use of our insight into activity\\n        recognition and abnormality detection for their elderly monitoring product ‘memo’; and\\n     \\uf0b7  Funding from the ‘Enabling Innovation’ project, jointly funded by European Regional\\n        Development Fund (ERDF) through the LEP and NTU, allowed CIRC to work on product\\n        and process innovation within SMEs in the D2N2 area. We supported over 150 local\\n        SMEs and companies, such as Digital Affinity, through design workshops, prototype\\n        building, and continuing support.\\n 1.2.4 Future research and impact objectives\\n Our future strategy synergises further our approach to research and impact and will continue our\\n Enabling Digital Technology vision:\\n     1. Exploit our interdisciplinary strength to explore ‘Smart Technologies’ for future living and\\n        working spaces.\\n        The University’s new £1.6M Smart Wireless Innovation Facility (SWIFt, Section 3.3) will\\n        allow CIRC, especially our CIA and NICCS groups, to introduce innovative technology\\n        onto the Clifton campus, allowing us to explore ‘Smart Places’ for the future. The £280K\\n        5G Connected Forest project, newly-awarded to Kanjo, will explore the potential for 5G\\n        applications to preserve forests and their environment. Similarly, our NICCS Research\\n        Group will work towards a smart cloud-based activity recognition system as a service for\\n        real-time monitoring and recognition. Our SmartNTU House facility will also provide a\\n        living lab facility to explore further research in improving people’s lives through the\\n        application of smart technologies.\\n     2. Address grand societal challenges, such as human health and an ageing society,\\n        through digital technologies, such as AI and data science.\\n        In terms of health and AI, our IS Research Group will explore the relationship between\\n        interaction and wellbeing of students with learning disabilities using tangible interfaces.\\n        For example, a €449K Erasmus+ project newly awarded to Brown will develop an AI tool\\n        to predict engagement and \\'Meltdown\\' events in individuals with autism. Our CIA\\n        Research Group will pursue further algorithms for human activity recognition in multi-\\n        occupant environments using new sensors, such as Infrared Thermal Sensor Array,\\n        alongside the application of entropy measures in activity recognition.\\n     3. Develop innovative and intelligent technologies for future medical devices and industrial\\n        practice.\\n        CIRC, through IS, CIA and CNCR Research Groups, is a collaborative partner in NTU’s\\n        LEP co-funded £23M new Medical Technology Innovation Facility, MTIF, that will\\n        specialise in healthcare-related commercial product development (Section 3.3).\\n        Furthermore, our Research Groups have expertise in cognitive and assistive robotics\\n        which will be explored for human-robot co-working scenarios in industrial digitalisation.\\n                                                                                                Page 4\\n\\n\\n     4. Recruit and support excellent researchers, embedding diversity, inclusion, and innovation\\n         in our ways of working.\\n         CIRC aims to build on our successes since 2014, enhancing sustainability and increasing\\n         research capacity. Our objective is to recruit and support the highest quality staff aligned\\n         to our Research Groups and further develop EDI policies and practices. We will also\\n         continue our drive to attract high-quality research awards and exploit new investments in\\n         research facilities (SWIFt and MTIF, Section 3.3). We are also committed to recruiting\\n         excellent and diverse PhD students and enabling their full research potential.\\n 1.3 Approach to Interdisciplinary Research\\n The structure of CIRC was designed deliberately to cultivate interdisciplinary and\\n multidisciplinary research within the UoA and across SST and NTU. This is further achieved by:\\n     \\uf0b7   Our shared research infrastructure (Section 3.3) supports excellent research with impact\\n         across all areas.\\n     \\uf0b7   CIRC groups coordinate weekly meetings where all members meet alongside our\\n         departmental seminar sessions allowing for frequent interactions and enabling cross-\\n         disciplinary work.\\n     \\uf0b7   CIRC encourages multi-disciplinary collaborations across NTU, which have led to joint\\n         publications including: Brown with Pockley and others in UoA A03; Shahtahmassebi\\n         with Liang in UoA B12; and Kanjo with Kuss in UoA A04.\\n     \\uf0b7   CIRC staff are involved in NTU’s five strategic research themes (REF5a), in particular\\n         with the Medical Technologies and Advanced Materials theme through work with the\\n         John van Geest Cancer Research Centre and with Liang on Global Heritage: Science,\\n         Management and Development. The latter has now been selected as NTU’s first\\n         Research Peak (REF5a), with £500k pa of investment to further development, it\\n         exemplifies NTU’s excellence in research and societal impact; CIRC is involved through\\n         Pourabdollah’s work on digital humanities.\\n     \\uf0b7   To encourage cross-disciplinary discussions, SST’s Annual Research (STAR)\\n         conference brings together speakers from across all the STEM disciplines.\\n 1.4 Strategy for an open research environment\\n NTU’s Publication Policy mandates the deposit of full text journal articles in our institutional\\n repository; this enables the sharing of research outputs and underlying data. A centrally-\\n managed open access fund was established in 2014 to increase our ability to provide immediate\\n open access to outputs via the gold route; within the UoA, funding of some £40k has supported\\n publications since 2014.\\n 1.5 Supporting a culture of research integrity\\n Matters relating to research integrity, including research ethics, are overseen centrally (REF5a)\\n and managed locally. The University Research Committee, chaired by the Deputy Vice-\\n Chancellor – Research and Enterprise, and reporting to Academic Board, is responsible for the\\n development and monitoring of research integrity policies and procedures. The Research\\n Integrity Committee provides support and advice to Research Centres, including CIRC. Robust\\n systems are in place to ensure research projects requiring ethical enquiry are thoroughly\\n scrutinised.\\n 2. People\\n 2.1 Staffing strategy and staff development\\n CIRC has an inclusive staffing strategy focused on strategic recruitment and supportive\\n retention. The UoA has targeted growth through strong research teams, with senior\\n appointments and internal promotions providing credible leadership and succession planning.\\n Key external appointments have been made at senior levels including 2 new professors\\n (McGinnity, Sanei) and 2 new associate professors (Cang, He). Through the SST Early Career\\n                                                                                                  Page 5\\n\\n\\n IRF Scheme (Section 2.1.3), launched in January 2016, we have appointed two individuals on\\n ascending research trajectories and provided them with time to get their research portfolio\\n established whilst building their teaching experience.\\n 2.1.1 Staffing and Recruitment policy\\n Staff retention. CIRC has actively facilitated existing researchers fulfilling their potential. As\\n already mentioned, the UoA has also recently piloted a doctoral fellow scheme (academic\\n associate), which has seen four new part-time lectureship/research associate posts leading to a\\n PhD award.\\n External recruitment. Recruitment has focused on the establishment of new robotics research in\\n addition to significant investments in our three existing Research Groups. CIRC has attracted\\n and promoted two internationally leading professors in robotic systems research, ambient\\n assistive technologies (McGinnity) and networking technologies (Sanei). The UoA has\\n benefitted from the SST IRF Scheme that supports increasing research capacity whilst providing\\n areas of research strength with succession planning. Two high achieving researchers (Shen\\n and Zhong) with outstanding potential were appointed in 2019 to 5-year positions with tenure\\n track routes to lectureships (Section 2.1.3).\\n In making new appointments, we ensure that each of our four Research Groups enjoy a mixture\\n of staff seniorities to allow for succession planning, mentoring and exchanges of ideas. Each\\n Centre has benefitted from new appointments and promotions as set out below:\\n      \\uf0b7   The CIA Research Group has benefitted from a promotion to professor for group lead\\n          (Lotfi), the external appointment of two associate professor posts (Cang and He) and\\n          the external appointment of a senior lecturer (Pourabdollah). The group has also\\n          received additional investment in an IRF (Zhong) in assistive robotics who is being\\n          supported to progress to permanent status.\\n      \\uf0b7   The NICCS Research Group’s strengths have been complemented by the recruitment at\\n          professorial level of an expert (Sanei) in signal processing with application to analysis of\\n          brain signals and images (particularly brain-computer interfacing). Additionally, the group\\n          has benefitted from an internal promotion to associate professor (Peytchev), and the\\n          recruitment of two senior lecturers (Sculthorpe and Kaiwartya).\\n      \\uf0b7   The CNCR Research Group was established in 2014 with the external appointment of a\\n          professor (McGinnity) in robotics research. It has been strengthened further by an\\n          external appointment at senior lecturer level (Ferreira) and the appointment of the UoA’s\\n          second IRF (Shen).\\n      \\uf0b7   The IS Research Group has been strengthened by an internal promotion to associate\\n          professor (Kanjo) and through the recruitment of a senior lecturer (Mahmud) with\\n          expertise in machine-learning that has led to the further development of the group\\n          around its commitment to user-centred approaches of enabling technologies.\\n This approach to ensuring mentorship and new ideas is underpinned by a programme of\\n international exchanges and visiting researchers, including Professor Muñoz-Organero\\n (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain) and Professor Jose Maria Sarabia (University of\\n Cantabria, Spain) who contribute to and enrich the research culture (Section 4.1).\\n 2.1.2 Staff Development Strategy\\n Staff development is coordinated by the Director of the UoA’s Computing and Informatics\\n Research Centre (Brown) in concert with the Head of the Department of Computer Sciences\\n (Lotfi). In line with the UK Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers, a\\n range of opportunities are offered, tailored to career stage. Our mentorship programmes provide\\n all staff below professorial level with a senior research mentor (professors or associate\\n professors), who has relevant research experience, to complement support through the\\n Department-run annual appraisal system that encompasses Individual Research Plans to\\n identify short-term goals and longer-term career objectives. Developing funding applications\\n                                                                                                    Page 6\\n\\n\\n through individual peer-review and sandpits aids colleagues to transform new ideas into stronger\\n project proposals.\\n CIRC invests in a portfolio of staff development initiatives that build strategic research capacity\\n in areas aligned to our Enabling Digital Technologies vision, including: staff research\\n sabbaticals; incoming and outgoing international researcher mobility; match-funded PhD\\n studentship scheme (Section 2.2.1); and financial support leading to grant capture (Section 3.2).\\n Sabbatical leave has been provided to allow concentration on research, impact and building\\n collaborations via the UoA\\'s funded study leave programme. Two types of sabbatical have been\\n funded based on research accomplishment and leadership and research career stage. During\\n the period, Wilmott and Shahtahmassebi have received periods of research leave.\\n 2.1.3 Early Career Researcher Support\\n ECR support is particularly important to our long-term strategy and the sustainability of the UoA.\\n A wide range of support for ECRs is available, including: the Winning Grant Funding Programme\\n (Section 3.2); new ECRs pairing with a research mentor; and ECRs being prioritised with NTU-\\n funded studentships. They have also benefitted from reduced teaching and administrative loads for\\n ECRs, typically, a reduction of 60% in Year 1, 30% in Year 2 and 10% in Year 3.\\n An exemplary case of our ECR strategy is the SST IRF programme: five year roles with reduced\\n teaching (initially 50 rising to 100 contact hours/year) and dedicated research support\\n (£10k/year) are intended as ‘tenure-track’ routes to permanent lectureships.\\n The UoA benefits from a vibrant community of research assistants and research fellows.\\n Postdoctoral staff are actively supported in their transition to academic or non-academic posts\\n by the School’s Staff Development Programme and via the University’s appraisal framework,\\n involving regular career development meetings with senior CIRC staff. Staff undertake a\\n bespoke programme, offered through NTU’s Researcher Development Gateway, to assist\\n career planning and grant writing. There are also opportunities to gain teaching experience and\\n qualifications.\\n 2.2 Postgraduate Researchers\\n Postgraduate researchers (PGRs) are an integral part of our research culture. The total number\\n of PhDs completed in the UoA has increased to 34 (4.9 p.a.) in REF2021 from 14 (2.8 p.a.) in\\n REF2014. CIRC has developed a research environment involving academic staff, research\\n fellows, PhD students, Erasmus students and summer interns in discussions that are inclusive\\n with the aim of promoting the sharing and exchange of research ideas with and through the use\\n of computing environments and facilities. CIRC also enjoys a number of cross-institutional\\n supervision collaborations, including McGinnity’s supervision of 7 doctoral candidates from\\n Ulster University (Professor Coleman), Pourabdollah’s supervision of 2 doctoral candidates with\\n the University of Nottingham (Professor Jon Garibaldi), and Shahtahmassebi’s co-supervision\\n of PhD research with University of Plymouth (Peninsula College of Medicine, Mr David Stell).\\n 2.2.1 PhD Funding and Recruitment\\n CIRC’s PhD student cohort: Support for, and the development of, the UoA’s expanded\\n postgraduate student community is core to the success of our research environment. Our current\\n cohort of 26 PhD students (31 July 2020) includes 50% Home/EU and 50% international students,\\n the latter from Libya, Nepal, Argentina, Iran, Nigeria and India. Our current PhD cohort includes 7\\n funded by overseas Governments, 6 that are self-funded, and 2 part-time PhD students who study\\n as academic associates with a concurrent 0.5 FTE 5-year Lectureship, promoting career\\n development. NTU’s PhD Studentship Scheme has provided competitive, fully-funded\\n scholarships that cover tuition and stipends to 13 CIRC PhD students since 2014. Collaborative\\n PhD research is promoted via NTU’s match-funded scheme (launched 2016) which covers half of\\n tuition fees and stipend, where an external sponsor contributes the other half. An example is\\n Kanjo’s project with The Manufacturing Technology Centre (Section 4.2).\\n Recruitment. Fair and consistent admission is ensured by the School Postgraduate Research\\n Tutors who chair PhD interviews. PhD applicants are required to have a Master’s degree (with\\n                                                                                                Page 7\\n\\n\\n Merit) or a first-class or 2:1 BSc Honours degree. EDI data on enrolled PhD students is available\\n at School of Science and Technology level; our gender balance is the same as the sector\\n (HESA) whilst our PhD population is considerably more ethnically diverse than the sector\\n (HESA).\\n Supervision. Supervisory teams include at least two NTU staff with experience of at least two\\n PhD completions between them. All supervisors attend a two-day training course and are invited\\n to meetings of SST’s Supervisors’ Forum, which supports best practice in supervision.\\n Monitoring. Students typically meet their supervisors weekly. Progress is formally monitored via\\n a supervisory panel and independent assessor, with annual monitoring as well as key\\n deliverables around Month 6 (Project Approval) and Month 18 (Transfer from MPhil to PhD).\\n Training and support. Training opportunities are covered during induction with the SST PGR\\n tutor and postgraduate representative and reviewed as part of annual monitoring. The NTU\\n Doctorate Plus Programme (see REF5a) maps PGR training to the Vitae Researcher\\n Development Framework and the requirements of the UK Research Councils and Quality\\n Assurance Agency.\\n SST-specific training supplements NTU-wide opportunities such that PGRs can create bespoke\\n packages of activities to support their development. There are workshops on research methods,\\n report writing, project management, research data management, equality and diversity\\n awareness, and additional English classes for researchers with English as a second language.\\n Our PGRs receive an annual research budget of £1K. In Year 1, this is expected to help fund\\n any additional specialist training requirements, equipment, or conference attendance, and in\\n Years 2 and 3, the funds are expected to contribute to conference attendance.\\n Throughout their degrees, PGRs also have opportunities to share their research and develop\\n presentation skills, including:\\n     \\uf0b7   In our annual SST STAR Research Conference PGRs typically present a poster in their\\n         first year and a talk in their second. In 2020, presentations were adapted to an\\n         online/virtual setting, incorporating a 3-minute thesis competition.\\n     \\uf0b7   The Department of Computer Science runs a weekly seminar series, with a mixture of\\n         invited external and internal speakers from Computer Science and related disciplines.\\n         PGRs are invited to present their work as a full seminar in their third year.\\n     \\uf0b7   CIRC groups coordinate their own research meetings, with informal opportunities for\\n         PGR presentations, such as practice talks for conferences.\\n     \\uf0b7   In 2019, SST established a biannual joint networking series with University of\\n         Nottingham for PGRs to share research ideas and grow sustainable collaborations.\\n     \\uf0b7   CIRC has hosted 6 international conferences this REF period which have provided an\\n         excellent platform for our PGRs to share their research (Section 4.4).\\n The success of our PGR strategy can be seen in our high level of on-time thesis submission\\n rates; 89% in 2017/18. The overall satisfaction for PhD students in the School of Science and\\n Technology in PRES 2019 was 84%, 3% higher than the sector as a whole. It is reflected also in\\n PGRs from CIRC winning awards at major conferences, including the recent best paper award\\n at ICACII 2020: XIV. We have appointed a number of our PhD community into postdoctoral\\n positions (Taheri, Sarsfield and Ortega).\\n 2.3 Equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI)\\n The University was awarded the bronze Athena Swan charter mark in April 2019 (see REF5a)\\n and targets a silver submission in 2023. Supporting this, our School strategy aims at\\n departmental Athena Swan submissions from 2022; the Deputy Head of the Computer Science\\n Department (Hartley) is leading on the delivery of an action plan towards a departmental Athena\\n Swan submission, which embeds staff and student mentoring, and includes initiatives such as\\n involvement by female members of academic staff in the creation of the \"Women in Tech\"\\n                                                                                             Page 8\\n\\n\\n network for East Midlands, and encouraging students (of all genders) to volunteer for Code First\\n Girls. Our School Athena Swan champion supports this initiative and coordinates School-level\\n EDI activities, including participation of six School staff in the Advance HE Aurora programme,\\n events for International Women’s week, international women in engineering day, Black History\\n month, LGBT History month, the installation of an on-campus nursing room for nursing mothers,\\n and maintenance of an EDI intranet with links to staff networks, policies and resources.\\n Recruitment across SST has transitioned through gender decoding of recruitment materials and\\n mixed-gender interview panels, to attract a more diverse staff pool. Specific training improves\\n understanding of equality and diversity within the workplace, including unconscious bias training\\n for all staff. Across all academic and research staff in SST in 2019: 32% identified as women;\\n 16% as being Black Asian and Minority Ethnic; and 4% declared a disability. Within CIRC, 19%\\n are women and over 45% of staff in the Department of Computer Science are from a BAME\\n background. CIRC supports NTU’s institutional target to increase the representation of women\\n within the professoriate to 35% by 2022. Presently, 50% of our associate professors are female.\\n Furthermore, we encourage a flexible and inclusive approach for staff working from home or\\n remotely. For example, the Support of Academic Returners (SOAR) scheme funds up to £5k\\n following a period of caring-related leave to support career pathway development.\\n Staff perception of EDI issues is very positive. The 2018 staff survey (run by an external\\n company) collected responses at departmental level. In the Department of Computer Science, of\\n which the majority of UoA staff are members, there was an aggregate average 92% positive\\n response to EDI questions on equality of opportunity, including EDI awareness and the\\n University’s approaches to respect and equality of opportunity.\\n 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n Our target for this REF period was to develop a portfolio of significant new grant income from\\n diverse, high-quality sources. This has been delivered with an income-spend of £3.06M,\\n compared to £1.26M in REF2014, and major grants from prestigious sources, including EPSRC,\\n BBSRC Innovate UK, The Royal Society, EU H2020, EU Erasmus+, and Leverhulme.\\n 3.1 Research income and funding strategy\\n The CIRC Advisory Group has consistently offered high levels of support to members to ensure\\n that all Centre-supported proposals are as competitive as possible through detailed grant\\n proposal assessments on a one-to-one basis, and multiple iterations of refinement from\\n conceptualisation to submission. We encourage all members to attend annual Research\\n Operations and Research and Strategic Partnership Development grant writing events (Section\\n 3.2) that focus on building a competitive bid, different types of research calls, and specific\\n funders. CIRC has also utilised direct University investment (approx. £80K p.a.) to pump-prime\\n research and grant submissions through 6-month research assistance, sabbatical cover, and\\n short-term research exchanges. We maintain a specific fund with a light-touch and responsive\\n application process so that we can react to immediate funding opportunities. Our €449K\\n Erasmus+ ‘An AI Tool to Predict Engagement and Meltdown Events in Students with Autism’\\n and £280K 2020 UK Government (Media, Culture and Sport) ‘5G Connected Forrest’ projects\\n are recent examples of how our strategy, research structures, support via studentships and\\n internal investment have led to major grant capture.\\n CIRC’s research funding portfolio consists of 11 projects, comprising funding from UK research\\n councils (EPSRC and Innovate UK) and EU research bodies (FP7, Horizon 2020 and\\n Erasmus+). There are significant awards in all Research Groups throughout our scope. For\\n instance:\\n      \\uf0b7   Within CNCR, Si–Elegans is a £1.2M EU FP7 project investigating performance\\n          discrepancies between artificial computational systems and brains.\\n      \\uf0b7   Within IS, No One Left Behind is a £457K EU Horizon 2020 project involves gaming\\n          toolkits that enhance student abilities across all academic subjects, MaTHiSiS is a £467K\\n                                                                                                Page 9\\n\\n\\n          EU H2020 on multimodal affect recognition for students with learning disabilities, and An\\n          AI Tool to Predict Engagement and \\'Meltdown\\' Events is a £430K EU Erasmus + project\\n          that focuses on helping individuals with autism.\\n      \\uf0b7   Within NICCS, REMOURBAN is a £300K EU Horizon 2020 multidisciplinary project\\n          centred on accelerating smart urban transformations.\\n      \\uf0b7   Within CIA, iCarer is a £250K EPSRC project offering adaptive platforms to carers\\n          support through a range of monitoring activities.\\n 3.2 Organisational infrastructure\\n Since 2014, CIRC has engaged with significantly expanded University teams, including our\\n Research Operations (Pre-Award, REF, Governance and Research Information Management)\\n (RO) and Research and Strategic Partnership Development (RSPD) teams. The RO team\\n provides bespoke advice and guidance to researchers with regard to external research grant\\n applications, including the Winning Grant Funding Programme. This team also ensures\\n compliance with terms of national and international research funders and provides support for\\n research integrity and research ethics policies. The RSPD team provides up-to-date knowledge\\n of funding bodies and supports academics to develop external partnerships, build research\\n consortia, and create high quality research and innovation funding proposals. CIRC engages\\n actively with NTU’s Knowledge Exchange Directorate (KED) for commercialisation support\\n where it is well practised in developing close partnerships with businesses to maximise\\n commercial potential. Working closely with KED, we have been able to identify, protect and\\n develop intellectual property assets arising from research with a clear and constant focus on\\n potential applications and markets. Other grant support infrastructure includes the £1.1m NTU\\n investment in ‘Worktribe’, a holistic research management system that is designed to support the\\n whole project proposal life cycle from proposal development to post-award management and\\n publication. Worktribe has been designed as a series of interconnecting modules: Pre-award;\\n Post-award; Contracts; Output Deposit; Staff Profiles; and Impact Recording.\\n 3.3 Infrastructure and facilities\\n Infrastructure. We have seen very major investment in state-of the-art, interdisciplinary research\\n facilities, including:\\n      \\uf0b7   The Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Facility (ISTeC, £11m including £5m from\\n          HEFCE/Research England, 800m2 research wing, completed 2017) that brings STEM\\n          subjects together to support collaboration between different subject areas, outreach\\n          activities, and industry engagement. This brings high specification spaces for\\n          collaborative and multidisciplinary research within one building, including, for example,\\n          our robotics research (CNCR).\\n      \\uf0b7   The £0.5M SmartNTU House facility (CIA Research Group) which takes the form of a\\n          typical home and is fitted with a wide-ranging collection of smart sensors (see detail\\n          below).\\n      \\uf0b7   CIRC is a collaborative partner in NTU’s Medical Technologies and Innovation Facility\\n          (MTIF, £23m including £9.7m from D2N2 Local Growth Fund, 3318m2 on two sites;\\n          completed 2020) which aims to enable early stage research and development in medical\\n          technology and medical devices. The Boots Enterprise Zone component supports our\\n          CNCR and IS research activities in medical design and research, providing an\\n          unprecedented new product development facility in the Midlands for partners. The MTIF\\n          building on the NTU Clifton campus enables early-stage innovation and impact-\\n          generation activities from our researchers.\\n The provision of significant and innovative new facilities is continuing into this REF cycle. The\\n University’s £1.6M Smart Wireless Innovation Facility (SWIFt), again co-funded by the LEP, will\\n turn Clifton Campus into a smart and sustainable ‘living laboratory’ for businesses, academics,\\n and policy makers. The project heralds a range of innovations, such as intelligent wayfinding and\\n virtual assistants, smart parking and building controls. SWIFt will also examine the application of\\n 5G and other smart technologies in industry, logistics and agriculture and explore how to create\\n ‘Smart Places’ for the future.\\n                                                                                               Page 10\\n\\n\\n Lab facilities. All our UoA members are located on the Clifton Campus. Our doctoral community\\n is co-located with research staff and supervisors. Every PhD researcher is allocated a desk and\\n computer workstation. The UoA has dedicated research labs within ISTeC, the Engineering\\n Building, and the SmartNTU house facility. The main facilities include:\\n      \\uf0b7  a 75m2 robot arena that has a VICON tracking system and state-of-the-art humanoid\\n         robots engaging human-robot/robot-human object handovers where we utilise a range of\\n         high specification robots, including iCUB, Sawyer and Robotniq robots, equipped with\\n         robot hands and the best tactile robotic sensors currently available (BioTac sensors from\\n         Syntouch). Other sensor systems include an AR10 hand and a DAVIS spiking neuron\\n         camera;\\n      \\uf0b7  a VR Interaction lab equipped with a range of sensors connected to sensing the affective\\n         state of learners (Tobi eye gaze, EEG – Open BCI);\\n      \\uf0b7  a 300 core HPC cluster;\\n      \\uf0b7  a 400 board FPGA computing cluster based on Altera (Intel) Stratix 5 devices. This\\n         system is one of the largest FPGA clusters in the country and each FPGA processing\\n         board incorporates an Intel/Altera Stratix 5 FPGA device, and is complemented by a\\n         separate embedded CPU processor board, memory, and high-speed interconnect. The\\n         overall system was developed with a budget of approximately £1M. Recent purchases of\\n         Stratix 10 devices from Terasic maintain the currency of the system;\\n      \\uf0b7  a 3Brain multi-electrode array system and a BioBot 3D bioprinter which enhances\\n         multidisciplinary computational neuroscience projects; and\\n      \\uf0b7  SmartNTU house, which is a living lab facility equipped with a range of ambient sensors\\n         including PIR motion sensors, thermal cameras, depth sensors, pressure and presence\\n         sensors.

Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society\\n CIRC is inherently interdisciplinary, with members of the UoA having backgrounds in\\n mathematics, physics, engineering, and bioscience. We have worked with more than 30\\n organisations across 18 countries such that that over 70% of the outputs submitted by this UoA\\n involve co-authors from other institutions, and over 50% of the outputs submitted by this UoA\\n involve international institutions. This has been enabled by: internal funding for research\\n visits/exchanges; match-funded PhDs (Section 2.2.1); supporting conference attendance\\n particularly for ECRs; support for pump-prime projects with strategically important collaborators;\\n and organising series of conferences (Section 4.4) in areas of strength and priority.\\n 4.1 Research collaborations, networks, and partnerships\\n The Computational Intelligence and Applications group enjoys a number of ongoing national and\\n international collaborations. Examples include Lotfi’s fruitful collaborations with Prof Mario\\n Muñoz-Organero (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid) on the topic of applied machine learning for\\n wearable and mobile sensor data, and Prof Naoyuki Kubota (Tokyo Metropolitan University) on\\n assistive robotic and community-centric system for elderly care. Members are collaborating with\\n the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tokyo, Japan on\\n assistive robotics, and, through Cang, we have ongoing links with Chiang Mai University\\n (Thailand) through our involvement in the €3M EU Erasmus Modus ‘FUSION’ project. In terms of\\n other international projects, the group enjoys on-going strong links with the Chinese Academy of\\n Science (China) through three other major projects (the €900K H2020-MSCA-RISE ‘SMart\\n rObOTs for fire-figHting’, the €310K H2020 ‘RABOT - Real-Time Adaptive Networked Control of\\n Rescue Robots’ project, and the £152K Royal Society and National Natural Science Foundation\\n of China funded project entitled ‘Adaptive Learning Control of a Cardiovascular Robot using\\n Expert Surgeon Techniques’). Pourabdollah is engaged on a major international collaborative\\n endeavour, ‘AI-FML International Academy’, whose aim is to promote the IEEE 1855-2016\\n                                                                                               Page 11\\n\\n\\n standard (Fuzzy Markup Language) through real-world applications, including organising\\n educational activities, workshops and competitions for different audiences. The work of the AI-\\n FML International Academy has led to the establishment of the IEEE CIS Content Curation\\n Subcommittee in collaboration with 7 international institutions, including Tainan, Tokyo\\n Metropolitan, Naples, and Santiago de Compostela. Jun He has international collaborations with\\n researchers from Sun Yat-sen University, China (Professor Yuren Zhou) on optimization and\\n evolutionary computation, and the University of Nottingham Malaysia (Dr Siang Yew Chong) on\\n co-evolution systems and computational intelligence. Both collaborations have produced journal\\n outputs in leading journals, including IEEE transactions on Cybernetics, Evolutionary\\n Computation, and Artificial Intelligence.\\n The Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Robotics group has engaged in an innovative\\n collaboration with the international SiElegans project consortia to deliver an enhanced\\n understanding of retinal ganglion cell visual processing. In particular, McGinnity collaborates\\n with the Istituto Italiano di Technologia (Neuroscience), University of Ulster (Intelligent Systems),\\n Vicomtech-IK4 (eHealth and Biomedical Applications), and the National University of Ireland.\\n Ferreria has been engaged in two Portuguese National Innovation Agency projects (ANI\\n Portugal 2020) with the University of Coimbre, Portugal: SEMFIRE provides for the development\\n of a robotic system designed to reduce the accumulation of combustible material in forests for\\n wildfire prevention, and CORE which centres on fundamental robotics research. More locally,\\n the group has ongoing collaborations with researchers from the University of Birmingham on\\n topics including machine-learning and data science.\\n The Network Infrastructures, Computing and Cyber Security group and Peytchev have\\n collaborated with 21 partners across 7 countries in the €25M Horizon2020 REMOURBAN project\\n which aims to showcase sustainability and future cities. Shahtahmassebi is engaged on 2\\n multinational projects (DigiLab and Swarm-VIP), and was responsible for the delivery of\\n intensive summer training courses on the R Software Package over the period 2016-2018\\n (attended by 50 researchers from 7 universities (including Nottingham, Imperial and Bristol) and\\n professionals from the NHS, Boots, PepsiCo and E.ON.\\n The Interactive Systems group has engaged with an extensive range of academic partners and\\n SMEs. On the group’s research in Digital Game Making through their EU H2020 No One Left\\n Behind grant, Brown collaborated with 7 partners from the game industry and the education\\n sector from 4 European countries - Austria, Germany, Spain and United Kingdom, including\\n Graz University of Technology, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Stuttgart Media University,\\n INMARK Europa (ES), and Grupo ZED Pyro Studios (ES). This work has led to internationally\\n co-authored papers in Sensors and in Computers and Education. The group’s research in\\n Robotics and through their EU Lifelong Learning Programme grant has engaged 7 partners from\\n third sector, industry and education sectors from 6 European countries, including the\\n Pedagogical University of Crakow Department of Psychology, and Aias Bologna Onlus (IT). This\\n partnership has led to internationally co-authored work in British Journal of Educational\\n Technology. The group’s Research in AI approaches to personalisation through EU H2020\\n MaTHiSiS engaged 18 partners from 9 EU countries, compromising European leaders in\\n business, technology, research and ethics including University of East London, Maastricht\\n University, and Vrije Universiteit Brussel. The project has led to internationally co-authored work\\n in British Journal of Educational Technology. A second strand to the group’s Research in AI\\n approaches to personalisation has, through EU Erasmus Pathway+, seen partnerships with 7\\n partners from 5 EU countries, representing education, local authority, third sector and industry,\\n and led to an ICACII 2020 best paper award (International Conference on Affective Computing\\n and Intelligent Interaction 2020) for ‘Modelling Engagement with Multimodal Multisensor Data\\n Using the Continuous Performance Test as an Objective Tool to Track Flow’.\\n During this REF period, members of the UoA were supported in visits to over 50 overseas\\n institutions. CIRC funds have been used for research visits to and from NTU, nationally and\\n internationally: examples include exchanges with Masaryk University, Czech Republic to build\\n an EU consortium, and collaborations with van Binsbergen (Royal Holloway, London), Moses\\n                                                                                                Page 12\\n\\n\\n (Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands), the University of Cantabria, Spain (Professor\\n Jose Maria Sarabia) and the University of Waterloo, Canada (Professor Mu Zhu).\\n These research exchanges have helped to expand the international collaboration links within the\\n UoA, including visiting professorships. Professor Mario Muñoz-Organero (Universidad Carlos III\\n de Madrid) was a visiting professor leading to journal outputs with our CIA group, and Professor\\n Jose Maria Sarabia (University of Cantabria, Spain) who was a visiting professor in 2014, also\\n leading to a number of journal outputs. The UoA supports staff to attend international\\n conferences and staff were also active in organising over 20 international conferences, including\\n 3 international conferences hosted by the UoA (see Section 4.3).\\n 4.2 Collaborative creation of research impact\\n Our Enabling Digital Technology vision has involved extensive engagement with research users\\n from diverse sectors including financial services, transportation, energy, healthcare, education\\n and security with whom we have facilitated sustained knowledge transfer through explorations of\\n new products and services. Specific examples include:\\n     \\uf0b7 Our IS group (Brown) has developed AI-based algorithms which can infer users’\\n         affective states (Horizon 2020 MaTHiSiS and Erasmus Pathway+ projects) that have\\n         been adopted by Fujitsu.\\n     \\uf0b7 The EPSRC ‘An Internet of Soft Things’ (Brown) project investigated how networked\\n         smart textile objects could improve perceptions of mental wellbeing in partnership with\\n         service users from Nottinghamshire MIND.\\n     \\uf0b7 Our NICCS group (Peytchev) is part of the €25M Horizon2020 REMOURBAN project\\n         (REF3 case study), which is a large-scale, international collaborative venture involving\\n         hundreds of research users across three lighthouse cities (Valladolid in Spain,\\n         Nottingham in United Kingdom and Tepebasi/Eskisehir in Turkey).\\n     \\uf0b7 Wilmott has engaged with UK-based banking institutions on quantum computing and\\n         associated security implications such as Deutsche Bank UK (Andrew Wray COO),\\n         Deutsche Bank Labs, Palo Alto (Aleksandr Oysgelt, Director for Technology and\\n         Innovation), and Santander UK (Ceri Godwin CIO). Wilmott’s ‘Quantum Readiness\\n         Programme’ which assesses robustness levels of current banking security against\\n         quantum technology, is due to be delivered at Refinitiv’s three Gravitate Global Summits\\n         (NY, Singapore, London in 2021/2).\\n     \\uf0b7 Our collaborations with research users extend to engaging the public as the ultimate\\n         users of our research. We hold annual conferences at NTU to engage teaching staff and\\n         Special Educational Needs Coordinators from the Nottingham Schools’ Trust to involve\\n         them in research on enabling technologies that support education.\\n     \\uf0b7 Our match-funded PhD programme (Section 2.2.1) also prioritises collaboration,\\n         industrial sponsorship, and networking opportunities. Partners include The Manufacturing\\n         Technology Centre that is part of the High Value Manufacturing Catapult, supported by\\n         Innovate UK.\\n 4.3 Contributions to the economy and society\\n Our REMOURBAN project in sustainable energy solutions improves the quality of life for\\n residents and smart energy usage initiatives have reduced energy costs. The energy monitoring\\n systems developed through REMOURBAN have impacted on the supply chain for SMEs\\n involved in the production of sustainable energy products, leading to the development of more\\n cost-efficient methods of housing retrofit, thus increasing the size of the potential market for\\n these products. Further, this increased quality of life and reduced fuel poverty for over 460\\n households in a deprived area.\\n Interactions with research users through our collaborative projects have led to economic and\\n societal impacts. Specific examples are reflected in our UKRI eNurture Project (TangToys) in\\n partnership with the Nottingham Schools’ Trust and the Ann Craft Trust. TangToys examines\\n how the digital world is changing the way young people with learning disabilities interact with\\n family, school and peers and what these changes mean for their mental health.\\n                                                                                               Page 13\\n\\n\\n Our IS research in multimodal affect recognition has informed UK policy debates. In May 2018,\\n the House of Commons Education Select Committee launched its inquiry into the Fourth\\n Industrial Revolution. Based on his published research, Brown gave oral evidence to the\\n Committee in January 2019. Brown’s appearance in front of the Committee led to an invitation\\n from David Davis MP to meet in Westminster to discuss how his research would enable changes\\n in the role of the teachers in the classroom and help to increase the effectiveness of education.\\n Other contributions to society delivered by the UoA include: our work on improving the\\n accessibility of Digital Game Making for students with disabilities involving 6 key European\\n partners; and our AI research to create personalised learning pathways for students with\\n learning disabilities and autism (EU H2020 MaTHiSiS and Erasmus+ Pathway+) involving 18\\n international partners from industry and academia including the aerospace and gaming sectors,\\n education, local authorities, and disability charities. The MaTHiSiS project focused on the real\\n issue of teachers not having enough capacity to attend to individual learning needs. Our\\n engagement detection algorithms addressed this issue and have been adopted by Nottingham\\n City Council’s Educational Psychology Service in its wider toolkit developed to support children\\n with social, emotional and mental health needs across 66 schools.\\n 4.4 Contributions to the research base\\n Our members have delivered 15 keynotes at international conferences and have chaired 21\\n conferences, secured 4 visiting professorships, acted on 20 journal editorial boards, and\\n assisted 16 research funders through peer reviews. Over the REF period, our UoA hosted 6\\n international conferences: iTAG 2014-2016 which was attended by 100 participants each year;\\n the 18th UK Workshop on Computational Intelligence (UKCI 2018) which was attended by 108\\n participants and led to the publication of 32 peer reviewed research papers as part of the\\n Workshop’s edited book (Advances in Computational Intelligence Systems: 18th UKCI,\\n Nottingham UK 2018, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 840 Cham, Switzerland:\\n Springer); and Recent Advances in Industrial Digitalisation, Robotics and Automation (Smart\\n Industry) Workshop 2019 comprising 13 keynote lectures. Recently, CIA group members with\\n researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have co-hosted the international conference on\\n community-centric systems.\\n In terms of peer review three of our staff are current members of the EPSRC peer review\\n college; one is on the ESRC review college; four sit on the European Science Foundation peer\\n review college; and a further three sit on other international peer review colleges (including,\\n EURAMET and Marie Curie Fellowships). We are active in journal editing with eight staff holding\\n 23 editorships, including Brain Informatics; Soft Computing; IET Intelligent Transport System;\\n EURASIP Journal of Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience; IEEE Signal Processing\\n Magazine. Eight staff have organised or chaired 21 conferences. Sanei had several visiting\\n professorships during the REF cycle (Imperial College London since 2016, King’s College\\n London 2016–2018, University of Surrey 2016-2018 and Shahid Beheshti University, Iran since\\n 2014. A further five staff have delivered 15 keynote lectures.\\n CIRC members have secured best paper awards. For example, Brown at JAT 2014 and ICACII\\n 2020: XIV, Cang at 10th Int. Conf. Software Knowledge Information Management and\\n Applications Chengdu China 2016, and Mahmud at ICEEICT2014 and IEEEHealthCom2018.\\n Other recognition awards include Peytchev’s Best Reviewer award at EURASIP 2014, Diploma\\n of Honour from the Romanian Biomedical Engineering Council and EPSRC (Recognition of\\n Major Contribution) award in 2018.\\n In addition to contributions to academic publishing as members of editorial boards, CIRC\\n members have acted as guest editors on 8 Special Issues including: Brain Informatics (Machine\\n Learning Techniques for Neuroscience Big Data); Cognitive Computation (Advances in Brain-\\n Inspired Cognitive Systems) 2016; and Virtual Reality (Virtual Reality for Therapy, Psychological\\n Interventions, and Physical and Cognitive Rehabilitation).\\n                                                                                              Page 14\\n ', 'w_env']\n",

Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n Context and Structure\\n The Unit’s research at The University of Huddersfield is centred in the Department of Computer\\n Science within the School of Computing and Engineering, with all staff entered being members\\n of that department. The Unit has grown significantly in research mass within the census period,\\n with 27.2 FTE staff being entered compared to 14.4 FTE in 2014. The Unit benefits from strong\\n ties to the School’s other department, Engineering and Technology, with which it shares some\\n research groups and funded projects.\\n Computer Science research submitted to the Unit is organised in several groupings:\\n     1. PARK: (Planning, Autonomy and Representation of Knowledge), the largest and longest\\n          running group, with specialisms in Automated Planning and Semantic Web, led by\\n          Antoniou and McCluskey. It developed our Impact Case Study “New AI technologies for\\n          enriching and recovering value from urban data with applications to traffic management\",\\n          and recently opened two application-focussed Centres with external partners, the Centre\\n          for Intelligent Transport Management (CITM), and the Centre of Artificial Intelligence for\\n          Mental Health (CAIMH).\\n     2. CVIC: (Centre for Visual and Immersive Computing), with specialisms in real-time CCTV\\n          analysis, augmented reality and machine vision for smart factory automation, led by Xu,\\n          who developed our Impact Case Study \"Enabling commercial impact from innovations in\\n          visual computing\".\\n     3. CCS: (Centre for Cyber Security), a recently established Centre with specialisms in\\n          applying AI techniques to intrusion detection and access control, led by Parkinson;\\n     4. CIndA: (Centre for Industrial Analytics), a recently established Centre with specialisms in\\n          IoT and Cloud Architectures, and strong links to CERN, led by Hill and Lane.\\n     5. CMDS (Centre for Mathematics and Data Science), a joint venture with Engineering and\\n          Technology to support mathematical research and teaching within the School, whose\\n          members include Murtagh and Titarenko.\\n     6. TAML (Technology Acceptance and Mobile Learning) research group, whose leaders\\n          Ward and Lu created our Impact Case Study \"Enabling better mobile learning for digital\\n          skills development\".\\n Development of the Unit’s Research and Impact Strategy\\n The Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy first issued a policy document in\\n 2013 outlining their envisioned global grand challenges. In September 2019 this document was\\n updated with primary grand challenges. The University’s long term strategy has been based on\\n supporting “areas of strategic research importance” (ASRIs), consistent with these global grand\\n challenges, to foster an interdisciplinary societal underpinning of research throughout the\\n University.\\n The ASRIs relevant to the Unit must be viewed in a multi-disciplinary context, and include\\n Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security, Internet of Things and Cloud Computing, Intelligent\\n                                                                                               Page 1\\n\\n\\n Manufacturing and Maintenance, Autonomous Systems, Data Science, Big Data\\n Analytics and Visualisation. The University has published a 5-year strategy map with\\n clear aims in each area of the University’s activities (cf Institutional Level Statement -\\n ILS). The University’s long-term vision has research growth at its core, influencing our\\n objectives below. The ILS contextualises this research focus: no academic members of\\n staff are on teaching only contracts, and 100% of all academic staff are to be publishing\\n at international excellence levels. For the Unit’s staff this translates to the following\\n strategy with clear objectives:\\n 1) Structure research around Research Centres with an ASRI focus: the structure of the Unit\\n      into a group of subject-related Centres provides the intellectual support for academics to\\n      grow within an environment which fosters collaborative research. The Unit initially had two\\n      centres covering ASRIs (PARK and CVIV) at the start of this census period and since then\\n      we have sought to expand these to include other ASRIs. This leads to our first 2 objectives:\\n      \\uf0b7    obj-a) consolidation and further investment in established research centres.\\n      \\uf0b7    obj-b) cultivation of new interdisciplinary areas of both research and impact, in line with\\n           University ASRIs.\\n 2) Steer research activity to being pervasive and outward-facing among academic staff: actions\\n      such as internal funding and new staff recruitment are focussed around the research centre\\n      ethos, with all staff being attached to existing centres, or research groups with the potential\\n      to achieve centre status. Collaboration with national and international partners will be\\n      encouraged to augment internal support and mentorship. This leads to our third objective,\\n      which is a direct mapping of the University KPI on academic staff:\\n      \\uf0b7    obj-c) increase the number of academic staff active at international level in computer\\n           science research to include all academic staff.\\n 3) Focus the activities of Centres on achieving both academic, economic and societal impact:\\n      centres primarily must be based on the research of international excellence, from which we\\n      will then seek to achieve societal economic impact, utilising an interdisciplinary focus. This\\n      leads to our 4th and 5th objectives:\\n      \\uf0b7    obj-d) increase significantly the societal and economic impact of our research activities\\n           both through established and through new research centres.\\n      \\uf0b7    obj-e) increase significantly the academic impact of our research activities both through\\n           international collaboration and quality and quantity of outputs.\\n Quantitatively, we equate the success of our strategy and the achievement of our objectives to\\n the doubling of metrics (funding, PhDs, internationally excellent publications, etc) between 2014\\n and 2021, and commit to a similar increase for the next period.\\n Current Research Growth and Vitality\\n To measure whether we are succeeding, firstly we can compare our performance using the\\n aspirations within the REF5 template for REF2014, and secondly, we show how during this\\n census period we are meeting our strategy objectives.\\n                                                                                                  Page 2\\n\\n\\n Our UoA 11 REF5 submitted to REF2014 stated that we would double our research outcomes\\n by the end of the subsequent REF period. We have achieved these aims in good measure as\\n follows:\\n          \\uf0b7 the number of PhDs awarded per year has more than doubled\\n          \\uf0b7 the amount of external research income per year has more than doubled\\n          \\uf0b7 the FTE of staff being submitted to REF2021 has almost doubled - 14.4 to 27.2\\n          \\uf0b7 the number of research students enrolled in July 2020 was at least 50% higher\\n              than the beginning of the current census period.\\n As an illustration of how we are meeting objectives obj-a) and obj-e), during the census period,\\n at least 44 outputs at CORE A / A* rated Artificial Intelligence conferences were published by\\n University staff from the PARK research centre alone. The table below details the year (first\\n row), the conference venues (second row) and the total publication numbers each year (third\\n row), with multiple papers at the same venue also shown. This gives clear evidence of the vitality\\n within PARK’s research environment which is leading to research of the highest quality.\\n      2014          2015              2016       2017         2018         2019           2020\\n    3*ICAPS         AAAI,          2*AAAI,      AAAI,        2*AAAI,       AAAI,         AAAI,\\n                  3*IJCAI,           ICLP,    2*ICAPS,       2*ICCS,      ICAPS,       2*ICAPS,\\n                    IROS             IEEE-      IJCAI,       2*IEEE-     AAMAS,          ICLP,\\n                                  CDC, KR,    2*K-CAP,        FUZZ,       2*ICCS,        ICCS,\\n                                    IJCNN       ESWC          ICLP        4*IEEE-        IEEE-\\n                                                                         FUZZ, K-        FUZZ\\n                                                                            CAP\\n        3              5                6          7            7            10             6\\n To illustrate our progress on obj-b), we started the assessment period with existing\\n strengths in Artificial Intelligence and Visual Computing (PARK, CVIC). Initial applications\\n of automated planning to security led Parkinson to create the CCS which now includes\\n areas of block chain, cryptography, and network security, and has supported the creation\\n of new degrees in BSc Cyber Security with Computer Science and MSc Cyber Security\\n and Digital Forensics. New professorial appointments Hill and Lane initiated research in\\n cloud architectures and IoT and their application to complex industrial data, and forged\\n the creation of the CIndA. New initiatives also include interdisciplinary research, for\\n example two new Computer Science Department Professorial appointments Murtagh\\n and Lee (Lee is submitted to UoA 12) have led to the establishment of the CMDS, a joint\\n venture with Engineering. The School’s composition of Computing and Engineering has\\n also led to interdisciplinarity, for example 4 staff in PARK are being submitted to UoA 12.\\n An exemplar illustrating the effect of our strategy’s focus on interdisciplinary research is the new\\n £1.8M Smart Rolling Stock Maintenance project funded via the European Regional Development\\n Fund and supported by the Northern Powerhouse. The project is led by the University’s Institute\\n of Railway Research (IRR) (UoA 12) in collaboration with PARK, and involves a range of key\\n industry partners including Northern Trains Ltd, Porterbrook and Unipart Rail over the course of\\n its three-year run (2020-2023). PARK leaders Antoniou and McCluskey are Co-Is with\\n responsibility for delivering automated planning and scheduling solutions for rolling stock\\n maintenance management, autonomy for the robotic devices involved in maintenance, and for\\n ontology development underlying system and process models within maintenance depots.\\n                                                                                                 Page 3\\n\\n\\n With regard to obj-c), we can point to the body of staff being submitted to REF to indicate\\n degree of pervasiveness of research culture through the department: of academic staff in\\n the Department not REF-submitted, either their research falls into a different Unit, they\\n are yet to secure a PhD, and/or they are at a teaching assistant or research assistant\\n status.\\n We are delivering on obj-d) as evidenced by our three Impact Case Studies (named\\n above, in Transport Management, Mobile Learning and Computer Vision and\\n Visualisation), as well as delivering significant impact to Health (Antoniou) and Security\\n (Parkinson), detailed in the sections below.\\n Support for Research Growth\\n Researchers apply for funding via a wide variety of mechanisms as shown by our REF period\\n funding profile in Section 3. To help researchers engage in these activities University\\n investments in the School include a Research and Business Development team (the RBD team)\\n which include two Business Development staff, a Research Development Manager, and an\\n Impact Officer. Coupled with the growth of pre- and post-award teams to support\\n academics/researchers in securing and delivering new research projects, these investments in\\n supporting infrastructure have helped to deliver research income and consequent research\\n impact (described in more detail in Section 3 of this document). The Unit (primarily though the\\n RBD team) also draws heavily on the University central resources to support technology transfer\\n activities, as well as the growing legal and contracts teams that help facilitate\\n contractual/collaboration arrangements with industry partners to achieve impact.\\n Three particular factors guarantee the sustainability of our progress in growth of research and\\n impact:\\n Institutional Support: Over the census period, the University has invested ~£7.9M institutionally\\n in supporting delivery of its Research Strategy (via the “University Research Fund” or URF), and\\n examples of the effectiveness of these funds are given in this document. This will continue into\\n the next research period (cf ILS).\\n New Application-Focussed Initiatives: 2020 saw the creation of several new, exciting initiatives in\\n terms of interdisciplinary positioning of the Unit’s research outputs:\\n     ●    the creation of CITM (cf Context and Structure), a collaboration between members of\\n          PARK and staff from Kirklees Local Council, SimplifAI Systems Ltd, to deploy AI\\n          technology to autonomously perform urban transport management;\\n     ●    the creation of CAIMH (cf Context and Structure), a collaboration between members of\\n          PARK and the University’s School of Human and Health Sciences and South-West\\n          Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, in the application of AI techniques to\\n          ADHD, autism and suicide prevention;\\n     ●    the coordination of a Framework Research Collaboration Agreement by members of\\n          CindA with CERN’s Beam Instrumentation Group to deploy novel opto-electronic sensing\\n          and associated signal detection and processing.\\n New Significant Research Awards: As well as the interdisciplinary £1.8M Smart Rolling Stock\\n Maintenance award mentioned above, in 2020 Vallati received a prestigious UKRI Future\\n Leaders Fellowship award (FLF) entitled “Artificial Intelligence for Autonomic Urban Traffic\\n                                                                                              Page 4\\n\\n\\n Control“. The FLF, in partnership with Transport for Greater Manchester, Kirklees Council, and\\n SimplifAI Systems Ltd, will last four years, will last four years initially with the opportunity to\\n extend to seven years, with a grant of £1.4M.\\n Research Governance\\n Research activity in the School is overseen by the School Research and Enterprise Committee\\n (SREC). Membership of SREC includes all professors and others in the School with a strategic\\n role. Day to day research management including allocation of University funding and oversight of\\n REF activity is coordinated by the School-wide REF Operations Group. In the Unit, Centre\\n Leaders are members of the SREC and the REF Operations Group, and with the Unit Co-\\n ordinator and Head of Department are responsible for developing Unit-level strategies such as\\n those in this document.\\n Open Research\\n The Unit is committed to ensuring publicly funded research is openly accessible, transparent,\\n collaborative and efficient. We use systems the University has invested in to promote open\\n research and open access to research outputs, and research data management (e.g. Elsevier’s\\n PURE information system). Where conflicts may occur (e.g. industry funded research, new IP\\n requiring protection prior to publication) support is provided to researchers from the RBD team to\\n proactively manage issues within the context of the Institution’s policies.\\n An example of open access is the Phishing Database set up by McCluskey’s research student\\n Rami Mohammad in the UCI Machine Learning repository, with 100-200 downloads every month\\n in the last year as evidenced in http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/24330/.\\n An example of open research is Antoniou’s EU-funded project Semdata www.semdata-\\n project.eu/ won under the FP7 Marie Curie International Researcher Exchange Scheme, in the\\n area of semantic data management.\\n Research Integrity\\n The Unit is committed to having a culture that promotes research integrity, in line with the\\n University’s commitment to the Concordat to Support Research Integrity. An institutional Code\\n of Practice for Research provides the framework under which researchers operate, and all new\\n projects and proposals are subject to ethical review and approval as part of a standard sign-off\\n process prior to project approval. Where specific ethical concerns may exist, the School\\n Research Ethics Committee provides guidance and support to researchers, as well as a link to\\n the Institution’s University Research Committee which has overall governance of research\\n integrity. As an example of this approach, Antoniou recently obtained IRAS approval for a\\n project he is leading with South-West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust on suicide\\n risk assessment.\\n 2. People\\n Staffing Strategy\\n Staffing strategy within the Unit has underpinned our research strategy, with an ambition to\\n grow high quality research with impact. Therefore, a successful research track-record is a pre-\\n requisite for all new academic and researcher staff appointments, with all expected to have a\\n PhD, and to have a research record that fits into our Centre-based culture (at the time of the\\n                                                                                                     Page 5\\n\\n\\n census, 90% of computer science academic staff had PhDs). In the case of senior\\n appointments there is an expectation that track-record will include significant high-quality\\n research outputs, evidence of securing competitively awarded research funding, and of\\n successful collaboration with external partners. In the case of early career appointments,\\n evidence of the potential to develop these outputs is a key element of the recruitment process.\\n In order to achieve the increase in research over this REF period we have applied this strategy,\\n increasing the number of full time Professors from 3 at the end of REF2014, to currently 9\\n Professors, and making in total 13 new appointments out of the 29 (head count) submitted staff.\\n These new appointments have built up strength in existing Centres, and enabled creation of\\n new Centres such as the CindA and CMDS. Over the REF period our REF2014 QR funds and\\n Central internal research funding support (URF) have been used predominantly to pay for\\n research fellows to assist research centres deliver on their research growth. Three of these\\n research fellows initially supported by internal funding are now members of the Full Time\\n Lecturing staff (Chen-T, Tachzimidis and Bargiannis).\\n The University introduced a Research Excellence Scheme (RESS) in 2016 which aims to\\n provide opportunities to excellent research staff from other Institutions to join the University on\\n indefinite contracts. During the REF period this has amounted to two professorial appointments\\n in this Unit, linked to specific ASRIs: Murtagh (Data Science) and Lane (IoT and Cloud\\n Computing). Murtagh subsequently formed the cross-school Mathematics Group which has\\n added substantially to teaching and research and supports the CMDS.\\n Staff development strategy for all staff pursuing a career in research\\n In terms of staff development and advancement, the Unit adheres to the national Concordat to\\n Support the Career Development of Researchers, which sets out the seven key principles for\\n funders and employers of researchers in the UK. The Unit aims to support staff according to\\n these principles whatever their career stage and believes a supportive culture enhances\\n researcher performance, improves staff retention, and aids recruitment of both staff and post-\\n graduate students. All staff undergo an annual personal development review/appraisal which\\n includes consideration of research performance and planning, including identification of specific\\n training and development needs/opportunities. Research performance is an important metric for\\n successful career progression of all academics, with indicators such as research outputs,\\n income and successful Post Graduate Researcher (PGR) supervision essential for progression\\n to senior academic/researcher positions. During the current REF period 4 staff were promoted\\n internally to Professor (Faber, Ward, Crampton, and Xu) and 3 to Reader (Parkinson, Vallati,\\n and Venters).\\n In terms of development and training, the Unit has access to a large institutional staff\\n development portfolio which is mapped against the Vitae Researcher Development Framework.\\n The Unit has actively engaged with the University’s initiative – for example, in an initiative with\\n the Chartered Management Institute for senior and mid-level staff to achieve Level 7\\n management qualifications and obtain Chartered Manager status. In the REF period 5 senior\\n academics – Hill, Antoniou, Carter, Ward, and Crampton in the Unit have so far achieved this\\n goal.\\n The School’s RBD team has also established a Researchers’ Network (aimed primarily towards\\n early career staff but open to all) and are running regular seminars and workshops on topics of\\n interest and value to the community (e.g. the funding landscape, IP protection and exploitation,\\n how to build industry partnerships, maximising impact from research, etc.). These are designed\\n                                                                                                 Page 6\\n\\n\\n to supplement centrally provided training and are practical/operationally focussed, encouraging\\n researchers to share their own experiences and challenges with colleagues. The team are at the\\n heart of support for staff: their effectiveness was recognised by the University as they won the\\n Outstanding Contribution to Research and Innovation Support award in 2015.\\n Support for Career Development of Researchers\\n All new academic staff appointees are provided with an introduction to the various support\\n structures with regards to research such as Pre-Award, Post-Award, PURE and the RBD team.\\n Each member of staff is assigned a mentor, and a research group (normally part of a Research\\n Centre). Staff benefit from mentoring within the context of their respective research groups, all of\\n which hold regular (typically weekly) seminar series where researchers can present and discuss\\n their work with peers and their senior group members and by providing help as appropriate to\\n identify key collaborators, establishing likely funding sources and assisting in drafting bids. Staff\\n early in their career are actively encouraged and supported in gaining experience of supporting\\n undergraduate and/or postgraduate teaching activities. Both Parkinson and Vallati, in\\n particular, achieved success supported by the Department’s development infrastructure: both\\n won Researcher in Residence awards from The Catapult Network. Within the University, Vallati\\n was nominated for Outstanding Early Career Researcher (2015), and Parkinson won University\\n research supervisor of the year 2020.\\n There is much evidence for the success of our early career support: all three ECRs from the\\n Department submitted in REF2014 (Vallati, Batsakis and Chrpa) now have teaching\\n responsibilities, and two of them have senior positions - Vallati is Reader in the Department, and\\n Chrpa is now Assistant Professor at Prague Technical University. Parkinson was an\\n undergraduate and doctoral student at The University: subsequently he became a lecturer and\\n has attained Readership status, and now is leader of the CCS. The University runs\\n interdisciplinary sandpits which are aimed particularly to encourage early career staff, and have\\n supported Bargiannis, Valatti and Tachmazidis. The School has a Research Development\\n Manager (Dr David MacDougal) to guide staff in their early career on the path to grant\\n application success.\\n The School supports Sabbatical Leave and Leave of Absence where it would enable an\\n academic to carry out a specific programme of research and development, or the completion of\\n a commissioned book or research paper or the preparation of a major research grant\\n application. For example, Ward developed the iDEA method during a 12-month sabbatical\\n leave within Buckingham Palace, leading to TAML’s Impact Case Study.\\n The Unit takes advantage of the University’s Collaborative Ventures Fund (CVF) which provides\\n up to £2,500 of internal funding for academics to work on short feasibility projects for external\\n companies at no cost to them. This has led to key relationships being developed resulting in\\n KTP projects, sponsored PhDs, Innovate-UK funded projects, with more details in Section 4.\\n Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity\\n The Unit is committed to creating and maintaining a culture of research diversity and recognises\\n that a positive and supportive environment where researchers from all backgrounds can flourish\\n will significantly support the Unit’s future ambitions.\\n                                                                                                 Page 7\\n\\n\\n Similarly, the University is committed to EDI and has robust policies and codes of practice to\\n guide and support staff and PGRs. In 2020, the University signed up to the Race Equality\\n Charter (REC) and completed the Investing in Ethnicity Maturity Matrix to inform the REC action\\n plan. In 2018, the University was accredited as a Disability Confident Employer and was a\\n signatory to the Mindful Employer Charter; it is also a Stonewall Champion and participated in\\n the Stonewall Equality Index in 2019. The University has four staff networks (LGBTQI+, BAME,\\n Women and Disability) run by members with support from the University EDI Officer. The\\n University has Athena Swan Bronze accreditation and the School in which the Unit sits is also\\n working towards an Athena Swan Bronze award.\\n EDI is also a priority within the University’s REF2021 Code of Practice, and a detailed Equality\\n and Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed as part of the process of selecting staff\\n outputs for inclusion within the REF assessment process. EDI influences our behaviour in the\\n Unit, for example it is mandatory for senior staff to undertake the University’s on-line\\n ‘unconscious bias’ and ‘diversity in the workplace’ modules.\\n An equality impact assessment was undertaken for the Unit and was used in the final\\n identification of output pool prior to submission. The most significant factor in UoA11 affecting\\n SRR/IR selection was postgraduate qualification, for example more than one third of staff who\\n were identified as not-SRR are still studying for a doctorate degree.\\n Regarding PGR students, personal learning support plans (PLSP) are developed for all who\\n require one. This is written following an interview between the PGR and the central University\\n Disability Team. Support is provided for those who declare a disability and is determined by the\\n content of the PLSP, whether this be specific display screen equipment or support from the\\n School Guidance Team.\\n PGR Student Recruitment, Development and Progression\\n Student Recruitment\\n At the end of the census period the Unit had 64 doctoral research students enrolled (43 FT and\\n 21 PT, a rise of 50% from the start of the census period), with nearly two thirds of them being\\n international. Recruitment of PGRs follows a robust recruitment process with all\\n projects/potential projects being advertised through a variety of channels, including the\\n University’s main application platform ‘Coursefinder’. The Unit follows the University wide\\n recruitment process for all of its doctoral research students, which includes a review of the\\n proposals by the research group/supervisor, interviews, completion of a Pre-Enrolment Form\\n and ensuring all the relevant checks are completed before the applicant is offered a place at the\\n University.\\n Internal funding has been provided to accelerate growth in research and enterprise and one\\n scheme which is available to potential research students is the fee waiver, where University fees\\n are fully or partly waived on the basis of merit. Since the beginning of the census period, 46 fee\\n waivers have been awarded to PhD and Masters by Research students. Examples of external\\n funding include Murtagh’s 4-year EPSRC NPIF award “Mathematical Foundations of Optical\\n Nano and Micro Mass Spectroscopy” which commenced October 2018. The Unit also benefits\\n from opportunities to collaborate within our sister engineering department’s EPSRC Doctoral\\n Training Programme, which fully funds a number (currently 12) of PhD studentships each year.\\n                                                                                                Page 8\\n\\n\\n Details of monitoring and progression-support mechanisms:\\n All doctoral research students are required to submit a Research Plan and Skills Audit after three\\n months (pro rata for part time and after two months for Masters). The purpose of this is to enable\\n students to develop a clear plan for their research project, to explore the skills and training which\\n will be required, gain any required ethics approval, to perform an initial literature search and from\\n this to identify their research question.\\n Records of supervisions are kept by both students and supervisors in the University’s SkillsForge\\n platform. Progression vivas are held after 9 and 21 months, for which students are required to\\n submit an annual report detailing their progress, and then give a short presentation to a panel\\n consisting of two academics from the subject area who are not involved in the student’s\\n supervision (this allows also for frank discussion of the student’s level of satisfaction with the\\n supervision provided). For progression to be approved, the examiners must be satisfied that the\\n student has made sufficient progress both intellectually and in terms of timescale for completion.\\n Research training needs form part of the discussion in these vivas.\\n Continued support in the preparation for these milestones is provided primarily by the supervision\\n team; generally comprising of a main supervisor, second supervisor and personal tutor. Additional\\n provision is available within the Unit by our Academic Skills Tutor and from a central provision\\n within the Academic English Centre, which provides a variety of targeted workshops and courses.\\n Organised courses on areas such as academic writing, plagiarism and reviewing literature are\\n complemented by tailored one to one support if required. For example, the five half-day sessions\\n of the Essential Journal Writing Skills Course are mandatory for all full-time doctoral research\\n students and introduces the art of producing original research articles with a focus on crafting\\n introductions and reviewing literature with detailed guidance on paraphrasing, referencing and\\n avoiding plagiarism. All doctoral research students receive an electronic newsletter which\\n provides an overview of the upcoming courses and workshops.\\n To ensure that the voice of the doctoral research student is heard and considered, the Unit runs\\n a PGR Student Forum twice per annum with membership comprising of the Director of Graduate\\n Education (DoGE), four student representatives (across all Units within the School of Computing\\n and Engineering), one Student’s Union representative, two academics, one library representative,\\n one technician and one secretary. The Forum has a Terms of Reference and is formally recorded.\\n All School and University Committees have representation from a doctoral research student, again\\n to ensure the voice of the PGR is heard and considered.\\n In addition to the high-level academic support and development as described above, examples of\\n additional resources available include training on research ethics and integrity in our on-line\\n Researcher Environment, our Teaching Assistant Preparation Programme and the University\\'s\\n Careers and Employability Service. Research students are encouraged to engage with internal\\n events such as our Three Minute Thesis competition and the annual PGR Conference as well as\\n presenting at external conferences and academic meetings. The Unit provides financial support\\n to each doctoral research student in the form of a £300 contribution towards a national conference\\n and £500 towards an international conference, through our Conference Presentation Fund. For\\n an example of its effectiveness, during the UK PlanSIG Workshop in 2020, out of the 11 papers\\n presented, 3 had current PhD students in PARK as first authors (R.Reba, S.Mund and H.Jaazaa).\\n 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n                                                                                                 Page 9\\n\\n\\n Strategy for generating income\\n Utilise the Research Centre structure: the Research Strategy detailed in the first section of this\\n document hinges on growth in research and impact. The structure of the Unit into a set of ASRI-\\n related Centres provides the intellectual support for academics to grow within an environment\\n which fosters mentorship and collaborative research. The success of the PARK group is\\n evidence of this, and the other, new Centres are likewise providing the same kind of\\n environment. As an example, the CCS became a standalone research centre in 2017 (formally\\n the academics were part of PARK research centre). This has resulted in more focus on cyber\\n security research and a total of £260k of income has been generated by Parkinson via a variety\\n of different grants and sources including UKRI, government, Innovate UK, KTP and industry\\n investment.\\n Reinvest Research Income into Centres: in order to help grow research and research income\\n within each centre, the School has a strategy of reinvesting any research surpluses back into\\n that research centre. This has supported obj-a) in our strategy, with research centres\\n (particularly PARK) being enabled to grow their resources by employing new research fellows\\n and offering PhD bursaries.\\n Provide close mentorship and bid development advice: as covered in Section 2 above, the\\n School and University have a range of support mechanisms for supporting grant bidding,\\n particularly those relatively inexperienced. With 13 new academic appointments in the census\\n period, developing the bid-winning potential of each member of staff is of paramount importance.\\n For example, Vallati’s successful bid for a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship started years before\\n with mentorship and subject assistance within PARK, as well as the benefit of international\\n collaborations. The identification of this particular mechanism was recommended and assisted\\n by our Research Development Manager (see Section 1) with industrial connections cemented by\\n our RBD team. While every external bid in the School has to be peer reviewed and signed off\\n before submission, the development of Vallati’s bid in particular was monitored, reviewed and\\n supported by his mentor, the Research Development Manager, and other School-wide senior\\n staff, to maximise his chance of success.\\n Develop and grow commercialisation opportunities: the School and Unit has been increasing\\n support for achievement of societal impact (strategic objective obj-d)), and the development of\\n more user-led research. This is consistent with University Strategy map KPI of 15% of research\\n outputs by 2025 to be generated in collaboration with end users. Progress has been facilitated\\n by the increased support within the RBD team (with two new appointments since 2014) as well\\n as the development of a Research Finance Support Team. This extra support has been\\n particularly important in the commercialisation of our Urban Transport Management research\\n (more details in PARK’s ICS). Also, Lane has secured £50k from the ERA foundation and £30k\\n from the Royal Academy of Engineering to develop both education activities and technical\\n engagement with manufacturing SMEs to support them with the adoption of Industrial Digital\\n Technologies.\\n Submitted Unit’s Income\\n UoA 11 has had a steady portfolio of research income year on year underpinned by a combined\\n investment in new academics, new research centres, research support infrastructure, mentoring\\n and development of academic staff. The research funding for the census period has increased\\n                                                                                             Page 10\\n\\n\\n compared to the last REF period by a per-year factor of more than two (total income for the\\n REF2014 period was £589K and total income for the current census period is £1,983K).\\n We continue to maintain a strategy of developing a mixed portfolio of grant funding resulting in a\\n balance between Industry, UKRI, EU and Government funding. While EU income has declined,\\n commercial income has increased, and with recent funding successes, Research Council grant\\n income should also rise to compensate for this (see Table below).\\n There has been a significant increase in bids during this REF period from a greater number of\\n academics. Our bidding portfolio has also increased from £2.5M worth of bids in academic year\\n 15/16 to £3.7M of bids in academic year 19/20. This aligns with the increased support both\\n centrally and with the School to facilitate the bidding process, provide training and support and\\n the increased academic mentoring with research centres.\\n   Percentage Income per Annum and Income Sources\\n                 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 2019/20 Total\\n   BEIS            25.9%     41.9%        63.7%        7.0%     6.9%      14.2%      12.5% 22.2%\\n   Research\\n   Councils,\\n   The Royal\\n   Society etc\\n   UK-based          0.0%      0.0%         0.0%       0.0%     0.0%        3.3%     19.7%    3.3%\\n   charities\\n   (open\\n   competitive\\n   process)\\n   UK central      10.8%       2.7%         6.7%     25.2%     61.4%      55.1%      19.7% 29.8%\\n   government\\n   bodies/local\\n   authorities\\n   UK industry,      0.0%      0.0%       11.5%      29.2%     14.7%      14.3%      40.2% 15.6%\\n   commerce\\n   and public\\n   corporations\\n   UK other          0.0%      0.0%         0.0%       9.0%     0.0%        0.0%      0.0%    1.0%\\n   sources\\n   EU              63.4%     55.4%        18.1%      29.5%     17.0%      13.2%       6.1% 27.9%\\n   government\\n   bodies\\n   EU-based          0.0%      0.0%         0.0%       0.0%     0.0%        0.0%      1.8%    0.3%\\n   charities\\n   (open\\n   competitive\\n   process)\\n Exemplars of Success in Grant Income and Commercialisation\\n As part of growing commercialisation opportunities in the Unit, five Knowledge Transfer\\n Partnerships have been awarded within the census period (growing from zero) and totalling\\n £800K of current and potential future research grant income.

By the end of this REF period the Unit has successfully achieved this outcome (current\\n KTPs with ValueChain, Brandon Medical and Andel Ltd).\\n Alongside the KTP target, there has been a focus on working with our company partners to\\n apply for Innovate UK grants and to look at commercialisation opportunities. An exemplar is\\n McCluskey and Vallati’s collaboration with Transport Consultants which led to grants of\\n progressive size: starting with an internal CVF of £5000, this led to a consortium project\\n including British Telecom and Transport for Greater Manchester winning funding from the\\n Innovate UK Competition “Solving Urban Challenges with Data” (2015 - 2016). This resulted in\\n a Transport-Consultants-led Innovate UK First of a Kind collaboration of approximately £1M, of\\n which PARK secured £150,000. This further led to the establishment of a joint venture company\\n (SimplifAI Systems Ltd), between PARK and the Transport Consultants, of which the University\\n owns 15% of shares, and the establishment of the collaboratively-run CITM detailed in Section 1\\n above.\\n Infrastructure and facilities\\n The School has invested in a dedicated state-of-the-art space for PGR students including hot-\\n desking facilities for over 50 students, lockers, meeting rooms, chill out area, kitchen facilities,\\n and a dedicated admin team. A new Technical Services Manager has also been appointed\\n bringing all the technical and IT technicians under one management structure resulting in more\\n joined-up support for our researchers.\\n Staff and research students have access to a wide range of computer facilities, humanoid and\\n other robots, servers and specialist computer software. For example, the deterministic track of\\n the 2014 IPC (International Planning Competition) which was organised by Vallati, McCluskey\\n and Chrpa, and attracted 86 entries (i.e. planning software) from all continents of the world,\\n would not have been technically possible without the use of the School’s inhouse high\\n performance computing facilities. Apart from the contribution to the discipline, this infrastructure\\n provided the foundation for a huge amount of empirical investigation, resulting in a substantial\\n article by the organisers in Knowledge Engineering Review 2018 and an earlier AI Magazine\\n article that together have attracted well over 100 google cites by December 2020.\\n The University’s Innovation Centre (the “3M BIC”) is housed opposite our Department\\'s building\\n and contains an Industrial Digital Technology demonstration laboratory. Lane, for example, has\\n used this facility to support his ERA Foundation funded initiative, in collaboration with National\\n Physical Laboratory staff, to engage with manufacturing SMEs to foster the adoption of Industry\\n 4.0 technologies.\\n 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society\\n Overview of Support for Collaborations\\n Collaborations in the widest sense are an essential ingredient in achieving all 5 of our research\\n strategy’s objectives, where the Unit is seeking to rapidly raise its research profile nationally and\\n internationally. Consequently, as well as winning direct external funding, we have at our disposal\\n both Central University mechanisms and School mechanisms to help us deliver them. These\\n collaborations range world-wide, are often interdisciplinary in nature, and often provide the basis\\n for the academic and societal impact of the pioneering research undertaken within the Unit.\\n                                                                                                Page 12\\n\\n\\n Our School’s impact strategy is strongly aligned to the Unit’s overall strategy (c.f. obj-d in\\n section 1). Its aim is to foster close collaboration with industry partners to accelerate knowledge\\n transfer and the adoption of new technologies to deliver impact. This includes extensive support\\n for the use of funded mechanisms such as KTPs, Innovate UK Collaborative R&D programmes\\n (e.g. SMART grants). Seed-funding grants such as the CVF detailed in Section 2 are often used\\n to lead to these larger collaborations, being the prime collaborations with research users (e.g.\\n the PARK’s involvement in Urban Transport Management started using a University\\n Collaborative Funding Voucher of £5000 and led to over a million pounds of investment in this\\n area from Innovate UK and Venture Capitalist funding – more details are given in PARK’s Impact\\n Case Study “New AI technologies for enriching and recovering value from urban data with\\n applications to traffic management”).\\n For collaborative support in general, the Unit has received:\\n      ●  Support for collaboration from the University Centre. URF is competitively obtained\\n         and is predominantly used to support collaborations. URF funds have been used for\\n         promoting interdisciplinary groups (e.g. CAIMH led by Antoniou detailed below), and for\\n         promoting international collaboration (e.g. the Robotics Centre led by McCluskey\\n         detailed below). For example, URF strand “Research Networking Fund” supports full-time\\n         and part-time postgraduate researcher visits to centres of research excellence.\\n      ●  Support mechanisms for collaboration from the within School include use of support\\n         staff (described in the People section above), and the use of funding devolved from\\n         Quality Related income (for example research fellow Franco was funded via QR to\\n         support PARK’s Urban Transport Management research).\\n Exemplars of Collaboration - Academic Networks led by Unit Staff\\n The EU-funded project Mirel (https://www.mirelproject.eu/) under the H2020 Marie Sklodowska\\n Curie Research and Innovation Staff Exchange scheme in the area of AI for law, was led by\\n Antonoiu as PI. The project was important in advancing the research agenda and state of\\n mining and reasoning with legal texts and is currently producing a reference book on AI and\\n Law. University of Huddersfield researchers visited institutions including University of Bologna,\\n University of Luxembourg, CSIRO, Stanford University and Zhejiang University, and hosted\\n international researchers and research students from China, Australia and Argentina. For\\n example, Vallati visited the Universidad Nacional del Sur (Argentina), leading to a jointly written\\n Scimago Q1 journal publication. Funded by Mirel, he also gave invited talks on knowledge\\n engineering for AI Planning at the University of Tokyo, Japan (June 2019), and at Universidad\\n Nacional del Sur, Argentina (July 2017).\\n The EU-funded project Semdata www.semdata-project.eu/ under the FP7 Marie Curie\\n International Researcher Exchange Scheme, in the area of semantic data management, with PI\\n Antoniou, was important in advancing the research agenda and state-of-the-art of open data\\n curation and quality, stream data querying and reasoning with big data. University of\\n Huddersfield researchers visited international institutions such as Stanford University, Wright\\n State University and RMIT, and hosted international researchers and research students from\\n China, Australia and Ukraine.\\n The COST European Network in “Autonomic Transport Support Systems” (TUD 1102, 2011 -\\n 2015), chaired by McCluskey, had the participation of scientists from 24 European countries.\\n                                                                                                Page 13\\n\\n\\n Departmental staff and students participated through scientific visits and participation in\\n workshops and competitions. The main outputs of the network were an edited, refereed book\\n “Autonomic Transport Support Systems” published by Springer (DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-25808-\\n 9), two international competitions, two training schools, various focussed workshops, and 45\\n short term scientific visits. As an example of the latter, in June 2015, the Network funded Vallati\\n to visit the TU Delft university in The Netherlands. The visit led to a number of subsequent\\n publications, including one in the AAAI-2016 conference, and eventually led to a patent\\n described below filed by SimplifAI Systems Ltd.\\n University Research Funding supported the Department’s Robots Research Initiative [2014-\\n 2017] with £86,986 supporting a sequence of high profile international collaborations,\\n underpinned by purchases of humanoid robots and support staff. The project funded the visit of\\n Dr Tiago Vaquero from MIT/CalTech in June 2016 to collaborate on robot research; in 2015\\n Chrpa visited the Robotics labs at LSTS, University of Porto, and the Icelandic Institute of\\n Intelligent Machines (IIIM), applying PARK’s expertise in Automated Planning to robotic\\n applications. The visits led to joint publications, including a publication at the premiere robotics\\n conference IROS, and joint Huddersfield - MIT organisation of the 2016 international competition\\n ICKEPS [https://ickeps2016.wordpress.com/] at ICAPS 2016, London.\\n Exemplars of Collaboration - Interdisciplinary Research led by Unit Staff\\n Lane is Technical Coordinator for a Framework Research Collaboration Agreement with\\n CERN. This has led to three PhD projects between CERN and CIndA, and a successful bid for\\n EU ATRACT funding for €100k in total. He holds a Visiting Scientist post at CERN in the Beam\\n Instrumentation Group in the Beams Department and works on novel opto-electronic sensing\\n and associated signal detection and processing for the CERN accelerator complex. He is also\\n the lead investigator of Huddersfield\\'s association with the ATLAS experiment at CERN as a\\n Technical Institute providing software, simulation and system design support to the trigger and\\n data acquisition activity. Huddersfield is the first UK university to be accepted by ATLAS as a\\n Technical Institute.\\n Antoniou received support from the University Research Fund to drive interdisciplinary research\\n across campus, with the aim of establishing an AI Institute. Based on this funding, he was able\\n to reach out and establish a lasting working relation with South-West Yorkshire Partnership NHS\\n Foundation Trust. Co-funded initiatives between the University and Trust developed world-\\n leading AI solutions in the areas of suicide risk assessment and adult ADHD diagnosis, while a\\n new initiative started in 2020 towards developing an AI algorithm for diagnosing autism. Potential\\n benefits include more accurate prediction of suicide and cost-effective decision support solutions\\n for diagnosing ADHD and autism providing significant cost savings to the NHS through higher\\n productivity per specialist clinician. These cost reducing effects are also the foundation for\\n funding received by Research England through Grow MedTech towards possible\\n commercialisation of the ADHD solution.\\n McCluskey was PI and overall manager of the EPSRC project “Machine Learning and\\n Adaptation of Domain Models to Support Real Time Planning in Autonomous Systems\\n (EP/J011991/1 and EP/J011800/1, 2012 - 2016), collaborating with Prof Austin Tate of the\\n University of Edinburgh, and Schlumberger at Schlumbeger-Gould research Centre at\\n Cambridge.

Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n 1.1 Context\\n Since 2014, the University has invested in research and has provided an infrastructure to expand\\n and support strategic areas, of which this UoA is one. The plan for growth and improvement is\\n articulated through our two last strategic plans (Ambition 2013-2018; Achievement 2019-2023),\\n and the related research strategies which require Schools to plan research in ways that reflect the\\n main objectives of the institutional strategies (see institutional statement, section 2). This UoA was\\n submitted in REF 2014, and it is strongly embedded in the School of Computing and Engineering,\\n where research in Computer Science was first submitted in RAE 2008. Over the present REF\\n period, the direction of research for the UoA has been refined - three clear clusters have been\\n nurtured - and the main strategic aim has been to increase quality and reach, particularly by\\n engaging with industry partners. The University has invested in this UoA; we have acquired new\\n facilities, created an interdisciplinary research centre, and invested in staff and funding\\n opportunities for doctoral students (see institutional statement, section 2.1.2). This unit has\\n therefore significantly matured and focused its research.\\n 1.2 Structure and Description of the UoA\\n Currently, 10 (9.8FTE) academics and 20 research students comprise the computer science and\\n the associated fields. The composition of the unit has changed significantly since December 2013;\\n 75% of academics have joined this UoA since 2014. The academics who left were replaced by\\n leading/promising world-class researchers, allowing us to bring maturity to the research areas\\n identified for growth whilst ensuring sustainability for the years ahead. Of the 10 current members,\\n six hold Associate/Full Professor positions. Four are more junior members. We have also identified\\n six members starting their career who have been identified as ‘next generation’ researchers (see\\n section 2).\\n     Academic                    Position & Research Area/Expertise          Year Appointed/Left\\n     Jose Abdelnour-Nocera       Associate Professor, HCI                    2003\\n     Junaid Arshad               Associate Professor, Cybersecurity          2015- 2020\\n     Waqar Asif                  Lecturer, Cybersecurity                     2020\\n     Wei Jie                     Associate Professor, Cybersecurity          2009\\n     Elahe Kani-Zabihi           Senior Lecturer, HCI                        2015\\n     Jonathan Loo                Professor, Cybersecurity & AI               2017\\n     Christian Sauer             Lecturer, AI                                2011- 2019\\n     Shanyu Tang                 Professor, Cybersecurity                    2017\\n     Ikram Ur Rehman             Lecturer, AI                                2019\\n     Hui Wang                    Professor, AI                               2020\\n     Xinheng (Henry) Wang        Professor, Cybersecurity & AI               2017- 2019\\n     Scott Yang                  Lecturer, AI & Cybersecurity                2020\\n     Massoud Zolgharni           Associate Professor, AI                     2018\\n The principal focuses of research are reflected in three multi-disciplinary themes. Each theme links\\n to a research centre/group that provides the coordination and infrastructure/expertise for targeted\\n                                                                                                  Page 1\\n\\n\\n research. Academics involved are not limited to just one theme, and many work collaboratively\\n across a number of these thematic areas.\\n       Figure 1. Our main research themes: Cybersecurity, Intelligent Computing, and Human-\\n                                          Computer Interaction.\\n Cybersecurity research, supported by the Cybersecurity and Criminology Centre (CCC),\\n addresses research and public engagement in cybersecurity, crime and their intersections. This\\n Centre became fully operational in 2017 to focus on cybersecurity research and research in other\\n forms of criminality and security issues, with a view to be an interdisciplinary resource for internal\\n and external collaborators. It has a wide research scope: in computer system and network\\n security, Loo has recently been supported by the Innovate UK and the Department for Digital\\n Culture, Media and Sports (DCMS): i) to develop Cyber monitoring and Defence for IoT (04/2018-\\n 02/2019), and ii) to investigate an intelligent threat hunting system based on Linux security\\n hardening and mandatory access control policies (04/2020-07/2020). In communication\\n security, Tang secured an Innovate UK grant (1026790, 12284 GOL) in May 2020 to develop a\\n secure mobile apps universal converter using cybersecurity and automation technology (10/2020-\\n 03/2023). Asif, a more recent addition to the CCC, has been involved in multiple EU projects\\n focusing on data privacy. Currently, 7 PhD students are attached to the Centre. Key researchers\\n in this stream are:\\n     •    Loo, Tang, Jie, Arshad, Asif, Yang\\n     •    Also from UoA20: Brooks, Harding, Henry, Murji and Wakefield\\n Intelligent Computing research is supported by the Intelligent Sensing and Vision Research\\n Group (IntSaV), which is a specialised group coordinating advanced research in all aspects of\\n Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. It covers a range of topics in machine learning and computer\\n vision/sensing, encompassing various applications in industry and healthcare. IntSaV has fostered\\n interdisciplinary research by providing a framework for cross-faculty collaborative working beyond\\n the School. The group has pursued a successful strategy of growth in several key areas: in\\n biomedical image processing, Zolgharni was awarded a British Heart Foundation (BHF) grant\\n to develop computer-aided diagnostic technologies (01/2020-12/2022). The area of signal\\n processing has been revitalised with the recruitment of Yang whose novel methodologies for\\n biometric recognition has attracted attention. IntSaV has recruited 8 PhD students. In 2020, this\\n group introduced a new MSc in AI as a one-year bridge between undergraduate and PhD degrees.\\n Key researchers in this stream are:\\n                                                                                                 Page 2\\n\\n\\n     •   Zolgharni, Loo, Rehman, Yang, Wang and Sauer\\n     •   Contributary members: 2 ‘next generation’ colleagues, and Chousidis from UoA12; and\\n         Brew from UoA3\\n Human-Computer Interaction research, supported by the Sociotechnical Group for Innovation\\n and User Experience (SCIUX), addresses the design and development of systems that meet the\\n needs of end-users globally. It investigates the sociotechnical and cultural differences inherent in\\n the process and product of design, and development, of interactive systems. SCIUX has\\n developed strong relationships with industry, national and international partners, and has been\\n supported by several funding bodies. In HCI, Abdelnour-Nocera is funded and working closely\\n with Heathrow Airport on improved decision-making in the deployment of automation in terminal\\n airside operations. In exploring various dimensions of quality of experience, Kani-Zabihi has\\n focused on human factors in multimedia systems. Currently, 5 PhD students are attached to the\\n group. Research at SCIUX also feeds into our postgraduate courses in Information Systems,\\n Health Informatics, and Software Engineering. Key researchers in this stream are:\\n     •   Abdelnour-Nocera, Kani-Zabihi\\n     •   Contributory members: 4 ‘next generation’ colleagues.\\n 1.3 Research and Impact Strategy\\n With the appointment of an Executive Dean in late 2014 (Professor Amir Alani), and under his\\n direction, the UoA has grown strategically to occupy a strong position in a number of niche\\n research fields. Four major goals were set in 2015:\\n     1) Focus on strategic research areas to increase quality and impact.\\n     2) Strengthen the environment to generate a long-term and stable research community and\\n         culture within the UoA, including through the establishment of Research Centre/Groups.\\n     3) Increase bid activity and secured funding, improving our national and international reach\\n         and recognition.\\n     4) Develop industry-related links, and identify and develop impact communities, and impact\\n         monitoring mechanisms for long-term impact engagement.\\n These goals were achieved as follows:\\n     1. Developing strategic areas of research\\n     It was agreed that we would reduce our focus from five to three main research areas; AI,\\n     Cybersecurity, and HCI. Early in the cycle, the School set out its strategy to support staff in\\n     the UoA, to be able to produce high quality research and strong impact in the field. We\\n     recruited staff with cybersecurity expertise that brought additional STEM weight to our UoA.\\n     This provided us with an opportunity to impact directly on sector-wide technological\\n     developments in the areas related to cybersecurity, as our third major research theme.\\n     2. Strengthening the environment\\n     The CCC was established in 2017 to address current and future security threats in a cross-\\n     disciplinary approach, contributing to the areas of cybersecurity and information security. The\\n     Centre has recruited and promoted world-class researchers (six professors from this UoA and\\n     other schools within the University). IntSaV, opened in 2018 to provide the expertise and\\n     support for our AI research, and includes seven members. HCI research, supported by the\\n     SCIUX group, has six members.\\n     3. Improving our reach\\n     Over the period, the UoA has established collaborative links with many industrial and clinical\\n     partners, including the following partnerships with:\\n                                                                                              Page 3\\n\\n\\n     •    Secure Technologies UK Ltd and Imediavan, funded by the Innovate UK (Loo, to develop\\n          cyber monitoring and Defence for IoT (CYMOND)).\\n     •    AB5 Consulting Ltd, through a KTP fund (Tang, to develop a secure mobile apps universal\\n          converter predicting apps security strength with a new fractal algorithm against security\\n          metrics).\\n     •    SALMAC: ‘Security Assessment tool for Linux Mandatory Access Control’, project funded\\n          by Innovate UK/DCMS, led by Middlesex University with Loo as a CI, (April 2020 to July\\n          2020) investigating an intelligent threat hunting system based on Linux security hardening\\n          and mandatory access control policies\\n     •    The National Heart and Lung Institute (Zolgharni, funded by BHF Project to develop\\n          cardiovascular diagnostic tools).\\n     4. Impact\\n     The University holds an Impact Group which has supported academics with their ICSs, and is\\n     presently focusing on upcoming impact opportunities beyond REF2021. Group members meet\\n     monthly to identify promising early-stage research projects which could potentially be\\n     impactful. From this UoA, Zolgharni serves as a group member.\\n     The two impact case studies submitted illustrate the UOAs approach to impact. One shows\\n     how we have developed an innovative approach to protecting internet-connected consumer\\n     devices from cybersecurity threats, winning financial development support from Innovate UK /\\n     DCMS and then taking this forward towards commercialisation. The second shows how our\\n     Sociotechnical Research Group for Innovation and User Experience has contributed to the\\n     effective adoption of Human-Centered Systems Design in Asia and Africa, as well as in the\\n     UK. This builds on well-established research at the University and extended it to benefit new\\n     partners, particularly in South Africa.\\n 1.4 Strategic plan for the next 5 years\\n Based on the University Research Strategy for 2025 (see institutional statement, section 2.1) the\\n principal aim for this unit is to further develop the quality and reach of its established areas of\\n research, to continue focusing on applied interdisciplinary projects, and to pursue quality research\\n spanning from underlying theoretical studies to transformative applications in the scientific,\\n commercial, and social domains. We will develop and pursue collaborative research, engaging\\n across the institution, and with regional and international partners, based on existing partners and\\n impact communities – with a view to expand. This is the basis on which will continue to develop\\n and grow this UoA towards the next REF, as we intend to produce research that impacts social\\n (in HCI research), medical (see collaborations with hospitals in Section 4.1), environmental and\\n scientific (see AI and Cybersecurity) aspects of our field. Our main objectives are:\\n     1. Expansion of existing research capacity\\n     The recent pandemic has accelerated digital transformation as people work remotely. This\\n     paradigm shift will not be completely reversed in post-COVID era. CCC will be addressing the\\n     profound questions posed by these changes to enhance cyber resilience and improve data\\n     security distributed across private and corporate systems.\\n     Similarly the rapid development of new online teaching and learning approaches in schools\\n     and universities will engage HCI in the design of online learning platforms, and study wider\\n     socio-political and economic implications on learning.\\n     The Government’s Industrial Strategy identifies AI as one of its four Grand Challenges. This\\n     will be a key focus area for us. It is envisaged that an AI Research Centre will emerge from\\n     the IntSaV research group, spanning the breadth of its interdisciplinary research areas.\\n                                                                                                Page 4\\n\\n\\n     2. Transformative multidisciplinary research\\n     We will sustain and expand our problem-driven and interdisciplinary research in the relevant\\n     areas of AI, Healthcare, Security, and Ageing Society. We will do this by building on the\\n     strengths of different disciplines at UWL already engaged interdisciplinary research, and grow\\n     externally to tackle complex computer science problems.\\n     3. Emerging research challenges in the discipline\\n     We will focus on fast emerging challenges and shifting paradigms - including AI ethics,\\n     explainable AI, cloud computing, and human-centred systems design - to meet the evolving\\n     needs of industry, healthcare, and society.\\n     4. Growth and diversification of research income\\n     We will grow and diversify our research income portfolio, from commercial and non-\\n     commercial sources, ensuring high-quality submissions and effective management of awards.\\n     We aim to double our present research income by focusing on large and longer-term projects.\\n     5. Training the next generation of researchers\\n     We will continue to include the ‘next generation’ of researchers, and ensure they are targeted\\n     for UoA and University funding and support opportunities. We will continue to attract high-\\n     calibre PhD students, including securing further industry-based PhDs.\\n     6. Pathways to impact\\n     We will further engage with existing identified impact communities and end-users, as well as\\n     identifying new ones, deploying systematic mechanisms to monitor and collect evidence. We\\n     will further establish and generate new highly effective collaborations (including KTPs),\\n     through consultancy work to industry.\\n 1.5 Support for Standards and Ethics\\n 1.5.1 Academic research infrastructure to support standards\\n The University Research, Scholarship and Enterprise Committee (URSEC) chaired by the\\n Deputy Vice-Chancellor, receives reports on matters of University-wide interest, including\\n regular updates and annual reports from schools on research, scholarship, and knowledge\\n transfer activities. URSEC also advises on research governance within the individual Schools. It\\n oversees key performance indicators and their fitness for purpose in the context of the\\n University’s Strategic Plan. A University Research Degrees Sub-Committee oversees\\n progression by postgraduate research students to registration to MPhil status, and onward to\\n doctoral (PhD) completion.\\n 1.5.2 Ethics\\n The University Research Ethics Committee (UREC) – also a subcommittee of the University\\n Research, Scholarship and Enterprise Committee (URSEC) - has overall responsibility for ethics\\n approval of all staff and students’ applications. This UoA’s staff and student approvals are\\n scrutinised by the School’s Research Ethics Panel (SCREP), chaired by Abdelnour-Nocera.\\n SCREP reports regularly to UREC. UREC subgroups are convened where ‘high risk’ applications\\n are identified by any School/College SCREP.\\n In UoA11, all research activities are also assessed rigorously for the health and safety under the\\n University’s established directives and protocols. The equipment being used for research\\n purposes are regularly inspected and tested to ensure it meets the technical and safety\\n requirements.\\n                                                                                              Page 5\\n\\n\\n 1.6 Open and Interdisciplinary Research\\n All researchers in this UoA are ORCiD registered, and 386 publications are associated with this\\n UoA and openly accessible through repository, out of which 304 (80%) publications have full text\\n associated with the record. At UoA level, we do the following to support open research:\\n      •  In the wake of open science, the priority in this UoA has been the full publication of details\\n         of all methods developed in research, so that they can be reproduced, criticized, and\\n         improved upon.\\n      •  Crucial to the field of computer science, where not only publications but also other research\\n         materials can be usefully shared, industry-standard code-sharing utilities, such as GitHub,\\n         is used to make the datasets, code of experiments, and analyses freely available.\\n      •  To stimulate faster impact, when possible, the scholarly research outputs are also openly\\n         available by publishing in open access journals and arXiv repository.\\n As indicated earlier, this UoA has a strong interdisciplinary make-up. This is sustained through\\n regular meetings and seminars, and through expansive engagement with a range of industry\\n partners (see section 4).\\n 2. People\\n 2.1 Staffing Strategy\\n In 2015, UWL introduced an Academic Employment Framework (AEF) which addresses the\\n recruitment, management, development and support of all academic staff. In this framework all\\n academic staff can focus (in addition to teaching) on research, scholarship and/ or knowledge\\n exchange activities (see institutional statement, section 3.1). Academic staff agree targets for\\n these activities which form part of their annual appraisals. Through this framework, SCE has\\n benefitted (as explained in section 1) from the addition of new research-active staff. Over the REF\\n period, seven key appointments were made to strengthen the areas of AI and Cybersecurity.\\n The unit’s current diverse level of seniority (Professors, Associate Professors, and more junior\\n SRR) is supported through different mechanisms, and ensure we have succession plans within\\n the unit. Research expectations and publications in peer-reviewed reputable journals, and\\n participation in bids applications, are at the core of this UoA’s activities. All new members of staff\\n are allocated mentors to enable them to adapt well to the School culture. This process ensures\\n that talent is spotted early to allocate research responsibilities that will contribute to the future\\n shape of the UoA. Where relevant, new members of staff join a supervisory team as ‘observers’,\\n and later - after training (which is mandatory at UWL) - as second or third supervisors. Our UoA is\\n diverse, in terms of gender, race, religion, and age. Our academics originate from over nine\\n different countries on three continents, with 80% being of BAME background.\\n 2.2 Staff Development\\n There is a broad-ranging staff development provision, both at University and at School level (as\\n described in the institutional statement section 3.2). Several services contribute to research-based\\n staff development, which has involved staff in this UoA. The AEF framework provides a 5-day\\n annual allowance for CPD and development.\\n At University level, Research and Enterprise Operations (REOps) offer lunchtime seminar\\n sessions on research issues including knowledge exchange; impact; collaborative projects;\\n commercialisation; managing research budgets; funding opportunities, industry and user\\n engagement. REOps also support applications for research funding. This UoA has greatly\\n benefited from this training and support, and been supported by REOps with funding applications.\\n HR provide training on equality and diversity, managing stress, appraisals, preparing for\\n promotion, working with external collaborators, and leadership. They hold a budget for\\n conferences, sabbaticals, and other staff development programmes. For instance, Abdelnour-\\n                                                                                                 Page 6\\n\\n\\n Nocera spent one year at the IT University of Copenhagen as part of a University’s sabbatical.\\n Staff on this UoA staff have also been supported for attending international conferences. The\\n University also pays for internal and external courses, and for staff to study additional\\n qualifications, including MAs and PhDs. For example, staff who take up studying for a PhD are\\n supported financially (no fees are paid) and through a 100-hour reduction in their teaching load.\\n Five members of staff have benefitted from this over the period; and another is presently\\n completing their PhD. The Library has provided training and one-to-one support on Open Access;\\n and has trained members of the UoA on understanding open access and compliance rules. They\\n encourage staff and research students to sign up to and use ORCiD ID. The Communications\\n department offers advice on media; public engagement; engaging with diverse audiences; social\\n media. The University also runs impact workshops, with access to impact advice (described in\\n section 1). It has provided training on impact; outputs planning; REF guidance; REF Code of\\n Practice. The annual University Research Conference led by the PVC (Academic) provides\\n opportunities to disseminate research findings, and network with potential new research partners.\\n This UoA has played a strong role in the conference, with regular attendance and presentations\\n (e.g., Abdelnour-Nocera in 2018, and Zolgharni in 2019 and 2020). Members of the UoA have\\n attended sessions on impact, public engagement, interdisciplinary research, mentoring, new\\n career researchers, at the annual conference.\\n At School level, the School of Computing and Engineering organises its own monthly research\\n seminars. Each session includes up to three internal (staff and doctoral students) or external\\n (visiting researchers) speakers presenting their latest research plans/findings. The seminars are\\n well-attended (>50 attendees each month) and attract audience from beyond SCE. It provides the\\n opportunity for junior researchers to benefit from detailed discussions and feedback on their work\\n with senior researchers. The UoA has been very active, accounting for ~70% of the speakers.\\n Other School-based support includes:\\n      •   Junior academics are encouraged to meet with their link/mentors at least twice a year. This\\n          may be on a one-to-one basis, and many discussions also occurred informally or during\\n          the monthly research surgeries. Some junior staff have submitted joint bids with their\\n          mentors.\\n      •   Staff are supported with research and scholarly activities through regular developmental\\n          workshops: e.g., introductory sessions to ‘Research Professional’; Research Data\\n          Management and Data Management Plans.\\n      •   All staff including junior staff are supported for attending internal and external conferences\\n          and contribute to the research centre/groups.\\n  Regular events include:\\n      •   Peer review groups where colleagues review each other’s research outputs and doctoral\\n          students’ proposals, prior to submission.\\n      •   Monthly School’s Research Meetings during which research ideas, projects, and research-\\n          related concerns are discussed.\\n      •   Twice-yearly Research Showcases, an all-day event which showcases the research work\\n          of all students and selected academics within the School.\\n All these initiatives are well embedded in the activities of the UoA, and have been sustained for\\n several years.\\n                                                                                                   Page 7\\n\\n\\n 2.3 Research Students and Supervisors\\n Community\\n All our doctoral students benefit from a formal centrally-run research training programme (see\\n institutional statement, section 3.2) based on the VITAE Researcher Development Framework and\\n delivered by the Graduate School, with contributions from senior academics from across the\\n institution. On this programme, PGRs complete a series of Research Development Units (RDU)\\n throughout the entire period of their registration, with embedded Epigeum interactive online\\n activities. At School level, our current 20 registered research students are an integral part of the\\n UoA, and we engage them in seminars and meetings where we discuss their research and that of\\n staff. We run monthly research seminars where attendance is mandatory for doctoral students.\\n They are also required to present their research at least twice throughout their PhD journey: once\\n in first year of their studies when are forming their research ideas and plan, and can benefit from\\n feedback/comments provided by Schools’ academics and from practicing their presentation skills;\\n and closer to completion they present their final research findings, to get feedback from colleagues\\n as part of good preparation for their Viva. These activities are considered as required milestones\\n for progression, and are monitored via regular updates and annual progress reports. We also run\\n twice-yearly School Research Showcase full-day events within the School to enable doctoral\\n students to showcase their research work to the wider University and to the invited guests from\\n industry/media/charities (e.g., speakers/guests from Royal Academy of Engineering in January\\n 2020). Showcase exhibits include research posters and oral presentations. Ten prizes are\\n awarded (through visitors and staff vote) each year for the best exhibit in different categories.\\n Prizes are in the region of £100 (in the form of Amazon vouchers or Students’ Union goods such\\n as quality clothing items).\\n Expansion has been a key priority. Fifteen of our students have gained Vice-Chancellor’s PhD\\n Scholarships (on a competitive basis) to study towards a PhD over the period; seven are current\\n students. During the period of assessment, there have had 20 successful PhD completions. This\\n compares favourably when contrasted with the previous REF period with just three awards. In\\n parallel, supervisory capacity has also increased from 10 to 14.\\n Training\\n The Graduate School also runs a mandatory training course for all supervisors on topics including\\n good supervision management, regulations, equality and diversity issues, student support, using\\n the VITAE framework, and helping students through the various progression stages and\\n milestones. We also discuss in these sessions the University’s Code of Practice for Research\\n Students and Supervisors. This policy sets-out the main principles for successful supervisory\\n arrangements, and the University’s main priorities for doctoral research (see institutional\\n statement, section 3.2). Quite a few senior colleagues contribute to this training from across the\\n University, including Zolgharni from this UoA. It also has also run a comprehensive SEDA-\\n accredited programme on Supervising Postgraduate Research for training new and experienced\\n PhD supervisors to enhance their practice of supervision (e.g., one member of the UoA\\n successfully completed the course in 2020, a school colleague also completed in 2019). The\\n Graduate School runs an annual doctoral conference across all subjects. The annual doctoral\\n conference is always very well attended by academics and PhD students in this UoA. We play a\\n significant role in supporting the event, and students presenting their latest research findings; at\\n least 15 PhD students from this UoA have presented in the last 5 years (2015-2020).\\n PhD students are each supported by a sizeable group of people. Each student is assigned a\\n principal supervisor who is a subject specialist, and a second supervisor. In case of\\n multidisciplinary research projects, a third supervisor from a different discipline may also be\\n assigned, when needed. Ensuring the next generation of researchers are confident in\\n                                                                                                Page 8\\n\\n\\n disseminating their knowledge we provide teaching opportunities with a limit of 6\\n hrs/week (including preparation). Students engage with groups according to their evolving degree\\n of expertise. Supervisors acts as mentors to support them in delivering those teaching duties.\\n Pastoral support is provided through the University’s central student support services.\\n Our students present regularly, and we support them in preparing for their presentations. They\\n have access to a central conference fund; e.g. a PhD student from IntSaV, was funded to attend\\n and present his research at ICRMIRO2020, for which he was awarded the ‘Best Presentation\\n Award‘. The doctoral students are also encouraged, and supported, to publish in discipline-specific\\n journals and the UWL University Press publication, New Vistas (see institutional statement,\\n section 3.2).\\n 2.4 Equality and Diversity\\n Training\\n The HR department delivers a mandatory programme of face-to-face and online training on all\\n aspects of equality and diversity which has been attended by all members of the UoA. Supervisors\\n have been trained on these issues through the compulsory programme of training run by the\\n Graduate School.\\n Research development opportunities\\n The research development opportunities available to staff – e.g. research funding, sabbaticals,\\n conference funding - always state the conditions and criteria that are applied. There is a\\n transparent process for these applications. Academic staff are actively encouraged to attend\\n briefing sessions on research funding opportunities, such as our regular lunch seminars and our\\n triannual research events. Access to other research support, such as conference attendance\\n support, sabbaticals and “seed grants” follow established procedures and are open to all staff\\n meeting the relevant criteria.\\n Recruitment and progression of research students\\n The recruitment of doctoral students is based on regulations that specify entry requirements, and\\n their application is supported by a written statement and an interview by a panel including\\n supervisors and a Graduate School Director of Studies to ensure fairness and consistency across\\n the institution. Progression is monitored by the Graduate School through a set of staggered\\n milestones, and final registration to PhD status (transfer) is overseen by the University Research\\n Degrees Sub-Committee. We aim to support completion within 3 to 3.5 years and have\\n mechanisms (e.g. regular supervision meetings, milestone presentations; regular reports) to\\n support all students in achieving this (see institutional statement). We subscribe to the\\n Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES) and this shows that students are satisfied with\\n this support; UWL is ranked 7th out of 103 institutions on progression in PRES 2020.\\n REF\\n As a UoA, we have received training on recruitment, promotion, appraisal; and the UoA leads and\\n reviewers have received specific training on equality and diversity, and unconscious bias to\\n support them in their role. They have been advised to access to practical advice and support from\\n HR if needed.\\n 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n 3.1 Income\\n The strategy in the unit is to support applications to both external income (Research Councils,\\n industry, government agencies, consultancy) and internal investments. The internal funding is\\n used to support active researchers with travel and equipment, and to provide funding for bursaries\\n                                                                                              Page 9\\n\\n\\n for PhD students. The University has a responsive structure - the Research and Enterprise\\n Operations (REOps) – to identify relevant funding opportunities and support bids.\\n This UoA has used REOps to identify funding opportunities and been supported to produce strong\\n applications. The UoA has its own panel of expert reviewers, composed of academics from various\\n research themes, to support each other with peer-review of the bids under development, to ensure\\n high quality research proposals are submitted to the funding bodies. This model, established\\n during the census period, has seen annual income generation of c£650k for the REF2021 period.\\n We have been successful at attracting research income in all main themes in this UoA, and the\\n diversity of funders reflects the multidisciplinary nature of our research. The main sources of\\n research income for Cybersecurity include Innovate UK and industry (e.g., Amazon), realised via\\n our close collaboration with the industrial partners. The AI research has benefited from support\\n provided by Innovate UK, whilst we also target specialist funders and medical funding bodies (e.g.,\\n BHF). The HCI research theme has been supported by the national academies (e.g., British\\n Academy) and industry (e.g., Heathrow Airport). This has allowed the expansion of our research\\n capacity in our three strategic areas of research.\\n Below is a brief account of funded projects started during the REF2021 period:\\n Cybersecurity (£381,140):\\n     •   A Self-organizing Community Detection Algorithm for Large-scale Social Networks (in\\n         AWS credits) $10,000 (£7,400)\\n         Funded by Amazon Research Grant (Jie), 2016\\n     •   A Provenance Framework to Minimize Malleability Risk in Blockchain, approx. £23,000\\n         Funded by Ministry of Science and Technology, Pakistan (Arshad), 2017\\n     •   CyMonD: Cyber Monitoring and Defence System for Internet of Things, £9,446\\n         Funded by DCMS & Innovate UK’s Cyber Security Academic Startup programme.

It offers a suite of tools to assist researchers in managing their research\\n data. Our online tools enable simple and secure collaboration, and are aligned with requirements\\n our Data Management Policy and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\\n     1. Support for Research Data Management and Storage\\n     The University has a workflow to support for research data management of funded research,\\n     and a package of Microsoft programs, both desktop and web-based, for collaborative\\n     document editing and data management. OneDrive is used for data storage, which has a\\n     desktop syncing application.\\n     2. Research Software\\n     The UoA is equipped with a set of free and specialised commercial software packages (e.g.,\\n     Matlab Mathworks, Microsoft Visual Studio, Deep Learning Frameworks), necessary for model\\n     developments and data analysis in research. The unit benefits from access to a Research\\n     Programming Platform which is a browser-based service providing access to Python, R and\\n     Julia through Jupyter Notebooks, Jupyter Lab, for general purpose code development.\\n     3. Research Data Resources\\n     Due to the long-standing relationships with several NHS Trusts and hospitals, IntSaV has\\n     access to the clinical data, in accordance with the ethical regulations. Complementary to\\n     information access, the group holds strong relationship with leading clinicians and medical\\n     scientists – important for guiding research directions and providing ‘ground truth’\\n     interpretations for AI developments. IntSaV also has participated in the development of, and\\n     therefore has access to the UK’s largest biobank of echo expertise (http://unityimaging.net),\\n     under the aegis of the British Society of Echocardiography.\\n 3.2.2 Research facilities and equipment\\n In addition to a significant investment programme on campus that has created social and open\\n learning spaces; advanced simulation spaces for research; a library without boundaries; and a\\n large flexible performance auditorium, the University has built a Sports Centre and a postgraduate\\n building for doctoral students. It has also built a number of laboratories and specialist facilities.\\n This UoA enjoys fully equipped computer labs and studios available to support ongoing research\\n with assistance of two full-time computing officers. We also have a dedicated Cybersecurity lab to\\n support research in the CCC. Researchers including permanent academics, postdoctoral\\n researchers, and research students have access to these resources. The CCC is also equipped\\n with Titax RTX GPU servers for high performance computations. These considerable in-house\\n computing and communication systems are enhanced by the extensive network infrastructure\\n                                                                                                Page 11\\n\\n\\n provided by the University IT Service. The SCIUX lab has several servers, cameras, and software\\n licences for usability testing in HCI research. It also benefits from an eye tracking specialised room\\n to conduct research on human cognition and perception.\\n IntSaV’s laboratory equipment and infrastructure includes several ultrasound imaging machines\\n (General Electric, Philips, Ultrasonix) for data collection, deep learning servers equipped with\\n NVIDIA GPUs for model training and developments, RAID severs for data management, 3D\\n motion tracking systems (Polhemus), medical imaging test equipment (Blue Tissue Mimicking\\n Phantoms, and GAMMEX Precision Resolution Phantoms), and 3D printers.\\n The facilities and infrastructure strategies are based on a mix of institutional investment,\\n philanthropic donations, and capital investment through bid income (where applicable). Our next\\n research strategy has factored in the acquisition of HPC facilities and state-of-the-art GPU-\\n equipped servers, reflecting our view of emergence of an AI Research Centre from the IntSaV\\n research group, and expansion objectives for Cybersecurity and HCI research themes.\\n 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society\\n 4.1 Nature and scope of research collaborations\\n Much of the UoA’s success in research has been realised via collaborative research. We\\n collaborate with other disciplines and divisions of UWL (e.g., Biomedical Sciences, Hospitality and\\n Tourism, Law and Criminology, Nursing, Midwifery and Healthcare). Externally, we engage and\\n collaborate with academia, industry and government, both at national and international levels.\\n The research grants we participate in are multi-institutional and involve industrial/clinical\\n collaborations. We are partners on these grants with other HEIs (e.g., Imperial College and UCL).\\n Strong industry links ensure that our research remains at the forefront of the computing fields,\\n allowing us to contribute meaningfully to national and international challenges in cybersecurity and\\n HCI areas, where we are partners with many companies (e.g., Amazon, Imediavan Ltd, AB5\\n Consulting Ltd, Heathrow Airport). A considerable body of the work being carried out in this unit\\n has also focused on healthcare applications and clinical research, where we have strong ties with\\n researchers in many NHS sites (e.g., St Mary’s Hospital, ULCH, Kings College, London) and\\n industry (e.g., KYMIRA Ltd). Examples of research collaborations which were initiated - or matured\\n - during the REF2021 period, and have been identified as promising and potentially impactful\\n projects by the Impact Group (see section 1), are provided below.\\n Collaborations with other HEIs\\n We collaborate with >15 UK academic institutions, including KCL, UCL, Imperial College,\\n University of Lincoln, University of Swansea, Brunel University, University of Salford, Ulster\\n University, University of Leicester, Queen Mary University of London, University of Birmingham,\\n London Metropolitan University, University of Derby, University of Huddersfield, and University of\\n Manchester. Examples of collaborative work include Zolgharni’s joint efforts with the Laboratory\\n of Vision Engineering at Lincoln to develop AI-driven solutions for oesophageal cancer detection\\n from endoscopic images/videos, and the work with the School of Medicine at Imperial on\\n myocardial deformation imaging from echocardiograms. In the area of Internet of Things, Asif has\\n been working closely with City, University of London, to develop prediction and control models for\\n energy management in sensor networks. In HCI, and in collaboration with Brunel University, Kani-\\n Zabihi has been conducting a large experimental study to establish the impact of the fundamental\\n dimensions of scent intensity and valence on user experience in multimedia environments.\\n The academics in this UoA have also developed close working relationships with a number of\\n Non-UK academic institutions, including Aalto University in Finland, University of Oulu,\\n Copenhagen Business School, IIT Bombay in India, IT University of Copenhagen, KU Leuven in\\n Belgium, Instituto Superior Tecnico Lisbon, University of Madeira, ITI / Larsys in Portugal, Dalian\\n Maritime University in China, Columbia University in the USA, University of Verona and University\\n                                                                                                 Page 12\\n\\n\\n of Florence in Italy. For instance, in collaboration with KU Leuven, Zolgharni is developing\\n innovative ultrasound strain imaging applications. A joint research proposal is being drafted.\\n Another example is the collaboration between Sauer and Aalto University, Finland, which focused\\n on the use of AI in selection of cyanide-free hydrometallurgical gold ore processing. More recently,\\n Zolgharni has been working with the Heart and Vessels Department within the University of\\n Florence to develop machine learning algorithms for automated clinical measurements.\\n Abdelnour-Nocera has been working closely with Cape Peninsula University of Technology and\\n University of Fort Hare, supporting them in service design and student retention. Loo has been\\n working closely with a number of universities in cutting edge technology; for instance, i) Beijing\\n University of Post and Telecommunications (BUPT) funded by Ministry of Education China in AI\\n and Machine learning in telecommunication technology (5G and beyond), and deep learning\\n technology for natural language processing and image processing, ii) University of Engineering\\n and Technology (UET Taxila) in wireless communication and antenna design, and iii) University\\n Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) in advance wireless resource management with AI.\\n Collaborations with Industry\\n Collaboration with the local and global industries involves joint formulation of challenging and\\n relevant research agendas of our research strategy, they include:\\n      •   A partnership with the Heathrow Airport that aims to address improved decision making in\\n          the deployment of automation in terminal airside operations (Abdelnour-Nocera).\\n      •   In collaboration with Secure Technologies Ltd and Imediavan Ltd, research has been\\n          carried out to exploit Cyber monitoring and defence for IoT which was developed under\\n          the Innovate UK and DCMS funding (Loo).\\n      •   Partnership to develop a novel framework for online marketplaces to facilitate safe, secure\\n          and dynamic multi-party interactions, in collaboration with MyPocketSkill which funded a\\n          PhD student (Loo).\\n      •   Joint venture in IntSaV developing deep learning models for monitoring and detecting atrial\\n          fibrillation using wearable ECG recordings, in collaboration with KYMIRA Ltd. Mobile apps\\n          are being developed to deploy the developed models for clinical pilot studies (Zolgharni).\\n The UoA also meets quarterly with SCE Industrial Consultative Board, comprised of several\\n major companies, including SEGA, Amazon, Oracle, Fujitsu, Huawei, Heathrow Airport,\\n PE.fiberoptics Ltd, Ratcliffe Groves Partnership, EMEA at Birst, Acumin Consulting Ltd, Digital\\n Service, Enterprise Services PLC, Masagi Ltd, SAS UK, Katchup, and Lombard Street Research.\\n The Board provides opportunities for both academics and industry practitioners to discuss and\\n receive feedback about current industry best practice, current changes and needs, and inform the\\n unit’s research agenda.\\n Collaborations with Hospitals/NHS\\n The IntSaV’s research profile, in many respects, is aligned with the government research agenda\\n on global societal impact and healthcare aspects. Most of the research carried out is focussed on\\n issues that have direct practical implications on quality of life. For instance, involvement in\\n healthcare relates to the advancement and exploitation of medical imaging from understanding\\n clinical needs to assisting in medical diagnosis. IntSaV has established strong research\\n relationship with several clinical partners, such as St Mary’s Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital, and\\n West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust. A recent example of collaborative research with the\\n clinical partners is the development of “Echognition” (http://unityimaging.net), a user-friendly\\n image annotation platform for collecting and building a large biobank of cardiac expertise, working\\n closely with cardiologist and physiologists from many NHS sites across the UK, including Glasgow,\\n Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, Oxford, Cambridge, Luton, Watford, Ealing and London\\n (Imperial, Kings College, London, UCLH, Bart’s Heart Centre, St Thomas’s Hospital).\\n                                                                                              Page 13\\n\\n\\n 4.2 Academic leadership and wider contributions to the research base\\n We publicise our research strengths regionally, nationally, and internationally to ensure that the\\n valuable work of individual academics is recognised by the local community, and on the world\\n stage. The research academics within the Computing subject and the associated fields have\\n produced 386 peer-reviewed journal and international conference papers since 2014. The majority\\n of these publications are journal papers. Our staff also provide academic leadership nationally and\\n internationally, influencing research agendas and strategy.\\n Editorships and membership of editorial boards\\n Academics in this unit hold editorial roles on the major journals:\\n      •  Editor-in-Chief.

      "[\"University of East London (UEL)\\n  Unit of Assessment: 11 Computer Science and Informatics\\n  1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n1.1      Overview\\nThe Computer Science and Informatics UoA is based in the Department of Computer Science &\\nDigital Technologies, within the School of Architecture, Computing and Engineering at the University\\nof East London (UEL) and supports internationally leading applied research with a clear focus on\\nknowledge transfer to government and industry. We firmly believe the vital role of research in\\nour academic life and support UEL’s key strategic objective of increasing the economic, social and\\ncultural impact on communities through our education, research & enterprise activities. Since 2014\\nthe Unit has pursued the following strategic aims:\\n•    Develop solutions for economic and environmental challenges [SDG Goal 9], while searching for\\n     opportunities of application and commercialisation\\n•    Increase the income generation of external research collaborations and knowledge exchange\\n     projects\\n•    Prioritise the recruitment of new staff who produce high-quality research in common with our\\n     focus of 'responsive’ research and knowledge transfer\\n•    Increase our research focus by extending our existing areas of strength – software engineering\\n     and cybersecurity – and to build two new research groups (Enterprise Computing group and\\n     Intelligent Systems group)\\n•    Taking advantage of the School’s diverse range of subject expertise and their synergy to conduct\\n     interdisciplinary impactful research\\n•    Improve the impact and dissemination of our work\\nDespite our small scale, with 12.2FTE research-active staff members, increasing from 4FTE in our\\n2014 REF submission, we are pleased we have tripled the size of our research-active staff.\\nResearch in the Unit has been structured around the following research groups:\\n• Secure Software Engineering [1]\\n• Enterprise Computing [2]\\n• Intelligent Systems [3]\\nThese groups have a mentoring and peer support role rather than a formal management function\\nand encourage inter-disciplinary research, mentoring of early career researchers and the\\ncollaborative supervision of research students.\\nSince 2014, our portfolio of funded research has grown to all-time high levels, with over GBP1.97M\\nof newly announced awards in this period. We regularly publish the outputs of our research in top-\\nrated conferences and journals. We have focused our internal and external funding to improve our\\nresearch environment, supporting high impact public engagement events, sabbaticals, research\\nsupport, journals and conferences, and equipment.\\n1.2 Research Strategy\\nOur performance in REF2014 (UoA11, 4% 4*, 33% 3*, 33% 2* and 30% 1*) was good considering\\nit was our first submission with just 4FTE. Over the last seven years, the institution has invested in\\npeople, specialist resources, and research infrastructure, to enhance capabilities and ensure a\\nsupportive and sustainable research environment.\\n                                                                                               Page 1\\n\\n\\nInformed by the feedback from our submission to REF2014, our research strategy during this period\\nwas adjusted to include the following:\\n• Build on our track record of excellence in cybersecurity that was recognised by the REF2014\\n    panel as an area of strength, with the creation of the Secure Software Engineering group.\\n• Sustain the growth in important areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence with the\\n    creation of two new research groups, the Enterprise Computing research group and the\\n    Intelligent systems research group.\\n• Use our expertise to develop solutions to economic and environmental challenges, as outlined\\n    in UN SDG Goal 9 of the Sustainable Development Agenda [16]. The outcome has been artefacts\\n    used for knowledge transfer with government and industry.\\n• Support the development of our new staff members through targeted investment, reduced\\n    teaching loads and mentoring.\\n• Enhance the research environment through internal investment in the recruitment of high-quality\\n    research students with PhD scholarships.\\n1.3      Plans for Research Support\\nTo foster academic collaboration, a series of research seminars have been delivered by research-\\nactive staff members to inform teaching-focused staff and PhD students on their research and to\\nstimulate internal discussion and collaborations across various research topics. PhD students were\\nalso invited to present their projects to get feedback and prepare for their annual reviews and PhD\\nviva. To foster external collaboration, a range of guest speakers have been invited from industry and\\nacademia to deliver lectures and participate in networking sessions. Furthermore, we have regular\\ninput to the Department from our industrial advisory panel and we have recently appointed a senior\\nindustrialist as a Visiting Professor, Lex Coors from Interxion, who will support our Enterprise\\nComputing group, in particular.\\nLex is a veteran key international figure in data centres, where he serves as the Chief Data Centre\\nTechnology and Engineering Officer for Interxion / Digital Realty, one of the world’s largest data\\ncentre providers (who provide data centre services to large organisations, including Microsoft, IBM,\\nUber, etc.). Interxion has major data centres in the UK, particularly in East London. Working with\\nLex, we will explore opportunities for industrial placements within Interxion data centres and PhD\\nscholarships. Lex holds key positions in organisations such as The Green Grid where he chairs\\nvarious committees, as well as the European Commission where he serves as advisor on the subject\\nmatter. This collaboration will give us the opportunity to work with Lex on some of the major research\\nissues currently being addressed in this field, particularly around Energy Efficiency KPI’s,\\nSustainability and Reliability. This relationship would be valuable for our future research funding bids\\ngiven Lex’s standing. Lex could be very helpful in attracting major industry in any future attempts to\\ncreate a major UEL data centre hub, not the least being a C level executive in one of the largest data\\ncentre organisations globally, with budget responsibility of $500M.\\nAcross the unit, institutional funding was provided to research-active staff to cover research\\nexpenses, such as software and hardware equipment, training, and ranked conferences. We\\ninvested significantly (over GBP0.5M) in new computer labs: a private OpenStack cloud computing\\nplatform, a Digital Security and Forensics Lab, a specific lab for post-docs and PhD students, a\\nrecently approved GBP300K multipurpose digital learning hub, and a new Cyber Security and\\nArtificial Intelligence Research and Application Centre which will formally open in 2021.\\n1.4 Research strategy for the next five years\\nBuilding on our achievements since 2014, and reflecting the expansion of our research base, our\\nfuture strategic aims from 2021 is in line with the institution’s ‘Future Life’ strategic objective. The\\ngoals of this objective are for UEL to be in the top quartile of REF2028 impact; to achieve sector-\\nrecognition for leading economy 4.0 innovation; while encouraging our economic and societal impact\\nwithin our East London community. To achieve this, we will work towards improving the key\\nperformance indicators of research quality, research impact, innovation growth and international\\ngrowth, by facilitating impact-led research and knowledge exchange, outreach activities, while\\n                                                                                                  Page 2\\n\\n\\nmaintaining an emphasis on civic engagement in our department. We propose to achieve this in the\\nfollowing ways:\\n•    Invest in emerging multi-disciplinary and established research areas. We will further invest in\\n     staff and infrastructure that will help to position us as a recognised department for delivering\\n     innovative solutions to both economic and environmental challenges.\\n•    Manage and deliver impact from our research and communicate this to scientific, business and\\n     public audiences. Alongside investment in research areas that can generate impact, we will\\n     monitor and facilitate impact, and embed impact delivery into our research training.\\n•    Increase our current collaboration and knowledge exchange with industrial partners on real-world\\n     applications of Computer Science and AI. This enables us to produce impactful and real-world-\\n     based research, per the institution’s long-term strategy for advancing knowledge and innovation.\\n•    Continue the use of internal and external funding to provide a useful budget for all research-\\n     active staff.\\n•    Increase the number of PhD scholarships, and set aside funding for PhD students to buy\\n     equipment and attend conferences and doctoral summer schools.\\n•    Increase our research focus by utilising the expertise in the department held by our more\\n     teaching-focused staff and early career researchers. We propose to establish a fourth research\\n     group, namely the Technology Enhanced Learning research group.\\n1.5 Proposed Research Group\\nTechnology Enhanced Learning (TEL) comprises a variety of innovative technological solutions to\\ndeal with numerous evolving educational challenges, including improving the experience of learners,\\nacademics, and institutions; providing adaptive, effective, and personalized learning to learners,\\nmanaging and meeting users’ requirements, etc. Overcoming these challenges can empower\\nlearners and consequently society and contribute to improving the community quality of life. This\\ninterdisciplinary group will focus on the following three key themes:\\n•    Technology for learning and teaching, assessment, and learner experience.\\n•    Best academic practices to support effective formal and informal learning policies.\\n•    Domain-specific education.\\nExpertise from the current research groups will support this new research area. Technology\\nAdvanced Learning artefacts are enabled by various AI technologies and techniques, which can be\\nused to customize the learner’s e-learning process, predict their performance, recommend learning\\nactivities, etc. Other distributed computing models such as Cloud Computing allow further flexibility\\nso that e-learning scenarios/processes can be enacted/orchestrated using a series of web services.\\nFinally, the substantive rise of adopting Technology Enhanced Learning software systems in real-\\nlife scenarios (e.g., academic organisations, lifelong learning, formal/informal learning, etc.)\\nnecessitates these software systems to be properly architected using various Enterprise Architecture\\nconcepts, standards, and frameworks.\\n  2. People\\nOur research-active staff are divided into three research groups, see Figure 1. Whilst it is not possible\\nto elaborate in detail all our researchers and their work, we have selected a few individual stories to\\nhighlight instead.\\n                                                                                                  Page 3\\n\\n\\n                                     Figure 1 Research groups\\n2.1 Research Group 1 - Secure Software Engineering\\nThe Secure Software Engineering research group currently has three staff members: Paolo Falcarin\\n(working on software protection and security), Shareeful Islam (risk management and security\\nrequirements), and Ameer Al-Nemrat (cybercrime and digital forensics).\\nHere is an example of a research project from this group:\\nDr Paolo Falcarin, Reader in Computer Science, led as principal investigator of the UEL team in the\\nproject ASPIRE (Advanced Software Protection: Integration, Research, Exploitation) [5], a 36-month,\\n3M Euro project funded by the EU FP7 programme (UEL quota GBP390,897), where he worked with\\nsix partners across Europe on developing advanced software protections for Android apps against\\nreverse engineering and software piracy.\\nFlacarin’s contribution to the ASPIRE software toolchain [18] is the first software freely offering\\nvarious code protection techniques against software piracy and copyright infringement, allowing\\nSMEs to improve their software security without paying the exorbitant license fees of the current\\nmarket leaders. The ASPIRE toolchain has been integrated in commercial products of companies\\nsuch as Thales and NAGRA-Kudelski.\\nIn particular, the ASPIRE Code Renewability Framework plugin [17] of the ASPIRE Toolchain, led\\nby Paolo Falcarin UEL’s team and Ghent University, has helped NAGRA-Kudelski addressing the\\nchallenge of dynamically updating crypto-libraries in their digital TV products, deployed across the\\nglobe in around 200 million devices, and in 2017 it also helped Thales in improving the security of\\nthe first version of the Alicem application, used by the French government to authenticate citizens\\nthrough their mobile phones.\\nAll the software developed by UEL in ASPIRE has been published open-source and is freely\\navailable as part of the ASPIRE toolchain. A YouTube channel [19] was created with thirty\\ndemonstration videos of all the ASPIRE protections, industry use-cases and security assessments,\\nreaching more than 10,000 views worldwide.\\n                                                                                             Page 4\\n\\n\\nFigure 2 highlights our collaborative efforts within UEL, with other Universities, with Industry and with\\nGovernment.\\n                       Figure 2 Internal and external collaborative relationships\\n2.2 Research Group 2 - Enterprise Computing\\nThe Enterprise Computing research group is led by Rabih Bashroush, working on the design and\\nimplementation of energy-efficient systems, especially in Cloud and data centre environments.\\nHere is one example of their world-leading research:\\nDr Rabih Bashroush, Reader in Distributed Systems and Software Engineering, is Global Head, IT\\nInfrastructure Advisory at the Uptime Institute, whilst leading this research group at UEL. He plays a\\nkey role in driving energy efficiency in the design and operation of data centres and computer\\nservers. Rabih provides strategic advice to public and private sector IT Infrastructure transformation\\nprojects covering consolidation, cloud adoption, resiliency and sustainability. He was named in the\\nUK Universities top 100 Best Breakthrough list for his work on energy conservation in ICT and was\\nthe recipient of the Industry Initiative of the Year DCD Global Awards 2018. The Breakthrough list\\ndemonstrates how UK universities are at the forefront of some of the world’s most important\\ndiscoveries, innovations and social initiatives. It was compiled by Universities UK, the umbrella group\\nfor the country’s universities, as part of the MadeAtUni campaign to show how lives are transformed\\nthrough research and practical applications of theory and knowledge.\\nThe work conducted by Rabih in the EU-funded EURECA project [6], which examined the energy\\nefficiency of data centres across Europe, provided the policy team with solid data. It demonstrated\\nthat IT servers in Europe remain idle for about 80 per cent of the time, making the introduction of\\nenergy caps the right thing to do. His research has impacted various other European policies such\\nas the EU Environmental Management Audit Scheme (EMAS) for Telecommunications and ICT\\nServices sector and the new EU GreenPublic Procurement (GPP) Criteria for Data Centres. Annual\\nsavings of over 27 thousand tons of CO2 equivalent emissions can be attributed to research and\\ninnovation projects led by him. He has led other European initiatives such as the European\\nCommission DG CONNECT SmartCities research cluster and has advised and supported various\\ngovernments including the UK, Ireland, and the European Commission.\\n                                                                                                  Page 5\\n\\n\\nOther group members are Dr Fahimeh Jafari and two lecturers who recently left (Dr Syed Islam and\\nDr Joseph Doyle) whose outputs are part of this submission.\\n2.3 Research Group 3 – Intelligent Systems\\nThe Intelligent Systems Research Centre is led by Professor Mansour Moniri and focuses on\\napplying innovative AI solutions to real-world business problems. Research topics include video,\\nimage, audio processing using AI techniques such as natural language understanding, machine and\\ndeep learning, big data analytics, mixed reality and recommendation systems.\\nHere is one example of their research projects:\\nDr Julie Wall, Reader in Computer Science, investigates research along the theme of designing\\nintelligent systems for processing and modelling temporal data. She has explored neural network\\narchitectures, ranging from biologically inspired modelling to computationally efficient machine and\\ndeep learning, to process a variety of data structures from numerical, audio, images, video, to 3D\\nfeature data from virtual and augmented reality environments. Julie has a close working R&D\\nrelationship with industry, which has involved joint industry-relevant research projects, internationally\\nleading publications and sponsorship for research interns and PhD candidates.\\nThis ongoing successful collaborative R&D history has led to the submission of successful grant\\napplications to Innovate UK, with a combined value of GBP2.2M. One of these projects is one of the\\nfour large Innovate UK grants awarded in 2019. This grant funded a post-doctoral research fellow\\nand two research assistants, two of whom are UEL alumni. The work of Julie’s team in this project\\nhas focused on the development of an explainable AI-based software pipeline that will identify and\\njustify the behavioural elements of a fraudulent claim during a telephone report of an insured loss,\\nusing statistical data science approaches and machine/deep learning models. The software\\ndeveloped in this Innovate UK project is being deployed in the insurance sector to tackle insurance\\nfraud. It has also been trialled by the emergency services to tackle hoax calls. In both sectors, the\\naim is to reduce expensive fraud and unnecessary resource deployment. This work has already\\nbeen published at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPs), the top-ranked conference in\\nArtificial Intelligence, amongst other top-level conferences. The technology is also patent pending.\\nOther group members are Dr Saeed Sharif, Dr Amin Karami, Dr Mustansar Ghazanfar, Dr Seyed Ali\\nGhorashi, Dr Sin Wee Lee, and Dr Fadi Safieddine.\\n2.4 Staffing strategy\\nWe have invested in high-quality research staff, and our REF submission from 4 FTE in 2014 has\\ntripled to 12.2 FTE in 2021. We have recruited research-active lecturers to join our three research\\ngroups, who produce high-quality research in common with our focus of applied research and\\nknowledge transfer. We have invested significantly in the intellectual and creative capital of our\\nresearch community and value the contributions of all colleagues by:\\n• providing an environment that stimulates innovation and minimises constraints\\n• ensuring fairness in the allocation of research support\\n• recruiting talented, outstanding researchers to bring competence on new technologies\\n• retaining and rewarding staff who are central to our research strengths.\\n2.5 Staff Development\\nWe have followed a policy of recruiting, retaining and rewarding high-quality ECRs. For example,\\nAmin Karami and Fahimeh Jafari were hired as lecturers and they are now Senior Lecturers; Julie\\nWall was hired as a senior lecturer and she is now a Reader and Director of Impact and Innovation\\nfor the School of Architecture, Computing and Engineering, Rabih Bashroush, Paolo Falcarin and\\nAmeer Al-Nemrat, who were senior lecturers in REF2014, are now Readers.\\n                                                                                                 Page 6\\n\\n\\nWe try to provide tailored support to our ECRs. During their first academic year, all ECRs are\\nprovided with a reduced administration workload that provides time for developing research ideas\\nand preparing funding proposals. ECRs are identified as PhD supervisors whenever appropriate,\\njoining a supervision team that includes an experienced colleague, ensuring effective staff training\\nand supervision. New staff members since REF2014, Fahimeh Jafari, Amin Karami, Saeed Sharif\\nand Julie Wall, all supervise PhD students, following a well-run mentoring programme supporting\\ntheir supervision skills base and passing on best practice.\\nEvery ECR and research staff member joins one of the three active research groups, whose leader\\nacts as a mentor providing support for career development, the formulation of publication and\\nnetworking strategies, and help in preparing research bids. ECRs and research staff are encouraged\\nto gain experience of organising conferences and workshops, supported by their mentor where\\nappropriate. ECRs and research staff are also supported in grant application development by senior\\nstaff who provide feedback on proposals before submission. All eligible ECRs have been mentored\\nby senior staff for preparing EPSRC First Grant applications.\\nAlso, the institution's research support team support the impact of projects driven by leading\\nresearchers. For example, a post-doctoral researcher was co-funded by the institution to support the\\nworld-leading research of Dr Rabih Bashroush. This support has enabled some ECRs to improve\\ntheir research profile and move to other positions elsewhere: Dr Joseph Doyle moved to Queen\\nMary, University of London, while Dr Syed Islam moved to JP Morgan. They still collaborate with\\nUEL researchers in writing research bids and co-supervising PhD students.\\n2.6 Research students\\nUEL has taken significant steps to improve the experience of our research students as our\\ncontribution to developing the next generation of researchers.\\nIn 2015, UEL launched a four-year programme of investment in fully funded PhD scholarships. The\\npublicity generated by this new initiative has resulted in an increase of student applications to the\\ndepartment since 2015. Our knowledge exchange activities have resulted in the initiation of match-\\nfunded studentships with industry partners, resulting in challenging research projects that are\\ndesigned to find bespoke solutions to real-world problems.\\nAll PhD students automatically join one of our three research groups, based on their research topic.\\nHowever, the supervision team may be made up of staff from different research groups to ensure\\nthe required expertise is covered for each project. Like the research carried out by our research staff,\\nour PhD topics focus on developing solutions for economic and environmental challenges. On\\ngraduation, our PhD students have been employed by various industries in software development,\\ncybersecurity, digital information, intelligent systems and finance, at leading businesses such as\\nMicrosoft, Thomson Reuters, Deloitte, Accenture, Atos, and RBS.\\nResearch supervisors help students develop a full training needs analysis, supported by the\\nGraduate School that manages all applications and recruitment, monitors progress, and organises\\nuniversity-wide training programmes. Formal training is provided through UEL Researcher\\nDevelopment Framework: all new PhD students are required to demonstrate learning from core units\\non research methods, project planning, research ethics and Intellectual Property laws. Further\\ndevelopmental opportunities for our students arise through participation at UEL’s Annual Research\\nConference, which provides a collegial, cross-disciplinary and supportive environment in which to\\ngather feedback and responses to ideas in their very early stages.\\nComputer Science staff have supervised 19 PhD students to completion from 2014 to 2020, and 21\\nPhD students are going to graduate in the next couple of years.\\n2.7 Equality and diversity\\n                                                                                                Page 7\\n\\n\\nAll appointments adhere to UEL’s Equality and Diversity (EDI) Policy. Training on EDI is strongly\\nencouraged for all staff, and additional equalities training is embedded within management training.\\nUEL was awarded an Athena SWAN Bronze Award in 2015, and more recently, the School of\\nArchitecture, Computing and Engineering received the Athena SWAN Bronze Award in 2020. UEL\\nholds the Level Two Disability Confidence award recognising our commitment to equality of\\nopportunity for people with disabilities. UEL is also a Stonewall Diversity Champion in recognition\\nof the continuing efforts in creating an inclusive and accepting environment for our LGBT colleagues.\\nIn October 2019, UEL established the Office for Institutional Equity, the first of its kind in a UK HEI,\\nto lead UEL's work on equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). It was created following an extensive\\nreview of UEL’s demographics and student outcomes, as well as its existing EDI activities. One of\\nits key aims is to ensure that the gender and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic mix of UEL senior staff\\nwill be representative of the population of London by 2020 (as stated in EDI policy). The OIE\\nadministers a mentoring scheme, staff networks and the Many Voices reading group which focuses\\non giving participants the opportunity to engage with essays and narratives by African diaspora\\nauthors, ensuring that both text-based and practice based research is informed by a more diverse\\nknowledge base.\\nThis unit did not submit any female academics for REF2014. The department went through a major\\nreorganisation during the 2013-14 academic year. As a result, 40% of the full-time, existing staff left\\nUEL. Whilst this process was extremely difficult for all concerned, it was necessary to ensure that\\nthe Subject Area was ‘fit for purpose’ and would not just survive but thrive in a highly competitive\\nREF and Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) focused environment. The re-organisation left a\\nvery gender imbalanced area, however, with no female staff remaining. It was important to try and\\nredress this in subsequent recruitment rounds. Since that period 5 female members of staff have\\nbeen recruited but, unfortunately, 3 of those members of staff have since moved on, leaving two\\nfemale members of staff in the department. As with every recruitment round, this remains an on-\\ngoing concern that we are keen to address, and we make efforts to encourage applications from\\nunder-represented groups.\\nUEL’s REF2021 Code of Practice includes an EDI section as required and to tackle several of the\\nissues mentioned above, and UEL’s Research Excellence Manager has been working closely with\\nthe department. Since REF2014, UEL now has an annual research review which includes an equality\\nanalysis of research outputs, which helps to identify these issues in preparation for REF.\\nUEL does not view itself as research-led but as teaching and research-focused, and our research-\\nactive staff are also involved in outreach. UEL’s borough of Newham and the neighbouring borough\\nof Tower Hamlets have one of the highest levels of poverty amongst older people and children in\\nEngland. With over 70% of its students from the BAME (Black Asian Minority Ethnic) background,\\nUEL is transforming lives and de-surfacing talents of its local communities and at a global stage.\\nCollaboration is at the heart of our outreach effort and we work with a range of partners across East\\nLondon, such as schools and colleges, organisations working with young people, young people\\nthemselves, their families, local employers and professional/trade bodies, and widening participation\\norganisations and networks to ensure we are delivering fit for purpose outreach. We have a diverse\\nstaff for this diverse student body, and our research informs our teaching and outreach, and our\\ncollaborative networks are beneficial for our students.\\n  3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\nIn this section, we describe some of the large-scale, nationally and internationally funded research\\nprojects that we worked on. We also describe the micro-level internal funding scheme which has\\nplayed a vital role in supporting small-scale research activities and internships in our department.\\nWe highlight the significant ongoing investments we have achieved in our computing infrastructure\\nand the physical environment.\\n3.1 Funding Portfolio\\n                                                                                                  Page 8\\n\\n\\nDuring the current REF period, there has been a rapid increase in external grant capture. We have\\nwon just over GBP1.97M in external income, mainly from the EU FP7 and H2020 programmes and\\nInnovate UK. Some examples of these concerning our core research themes include:\\nExample 1 – Secure Software Engineering\\nDr Paolo Falcarin worked as principal investigator in the project ASPIRE (Advanced Software\\nProtection: Integration, Research, Exploitation) [2], a 36 month, EUR3M project funded by the EU\\nFP7 programme (UEL quota GBP390,897). Paolo worked with a consortium of three market leaders\\nin security ICT solutions and four academic institutions, from 6 European countries to develop\\nadvanced software protections for Android apps against reverse engineering and software piracy,\\nwhich have been adopted by companies such as Thales and Nagra-Kudelski.\\nExample 2 – Enterprise Computing\\nDr Rabih Bashroush was the principal investigator and coordinator of EURECA [3], a 36 month,\\nEUR1.5M project funded by the EU H2020 programme (GBP308,422 UEL quota), where he worked\\nwith partners across Europe on supporting the development of European standards, best practices\\nand policies related to energy efficiency in data centres and green public procurement by providing\\nscientific evidence and data.\\nExample 3 – Intelligent Systems\\nDr Julie Wall is the principal investigator of a 24 month, GBP2M project funded by Innovate UK (UEL\\nquota GBP473,479). This work, in collaboration with the SMEs Intelligent Voice Ltd and Strenuus\\nLtd, is developing an AI-based explainable pipeline that will identify and justify the behavioural\\nelements of a fraudulent claim during a telephone report of an insured loss.\\nExample 4 – Knowledge Transfer\\nTo develop more flexible funding streams, Professor Mansour Moniri, Director of Research and\\nKnowledge Exchange helped our unit in funding the following KTP projects with Innovate UK:\\n•    Rabih Bashroush helped Techbuyer Ltd by developing scientific capabilities to model and\\n     simulate complex data centre environments (value: GBP194K).\\n•    Shareeful Islam helped Mediprospects Ltd in improving best practices in training by using data\\n     analytics (value: GBP160K).\\n•    Julie Wall helped Intelligent Voice Ltd to enhance their video-conferencing services with virtual\\n     and augmented reality technology (value: GBP268K).\\nMicro-Level Internal Funding\\nAll staff have the opportunity to apply for UEL’s Funded Internship Scheme, which provides a funded\\nstudent intern for 3 months, to support pilot studies or contribute to the processing and analysis of\\nresearch data. The process also provides students with valuable skills and experience of working on\\nreal-world Computer Science projects.\\n3.2 Infrastructure and facilities\\nUEL has made significant ongoing investments in computing infrastructure and the physical\\nenvironment since 2014, circa GBP5M.\\nComputing Labs\\nThe research environment has benefited from significant infrastructure investment including a major\\nrefurbishment of the Knowledge Dock Building in 2015, which hosts PhD students and teaching labs.\\nThe refurbishment includes the research laboratories, a specialist OpenStack private cloud\\n                                                                                              Page 9\\n\\n\\ncomputing platform, as well as refurbishment of the cybersecurity labs. The labs include about 88\\ncomputers, and 6 switches (also used for teaching). We have 5 racks, hosting our servers and the\\nnetworking equipment; one of the racks is hosting our OpenStack cloud (10 nodes), which is used\\nby many students and staff for teaching and research.\\nThe school invested in a new lab, the “Chip Forensic Laboratory” managed by Dr Ameer Al-Nemrat,\\nwhere research is carried out on the latest techniques for decapsulating all types of plastic\\nencapsulated parts in integrated circuits. This lab supports academic study and research, and we\\noften assist law enforcement in data recovery from devices, repairing of damaged chips, and\\nrepairing of damaged memory devices.\\nFrom 2018 – 2020, another major upgrade took place in all our specialist labs in the Knowledge\\nDock. A brand-new lab was set up with 60+ machines to support teaching and research activities.\\nFunding has recently been agreed with UEL to develop additional space in the Knowledge Docks\\ninto a state-of-the-art Enterprise Tech Hub, consisting of another 100+ machines and a flexible multi-\\nfunctional lab set up.\\nIn May 2018, Computer Science students (with the support of staff) launched a student-led\\n“transformation lab. They were given a previously disused Computing lab in the Knowledge Dock to\\nuse for this purpose. The IT equipment for this lab was sourced by students from UEL’s IT services\\nand refurbished and upcycled by these students. The transformation lab is peer-led and provides a\\nspace for senior students to mentor and train their peers in current in-demand industry skills, work\\non their research projects, and to provide peer-assisted study support sessions.\\n  4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society\\nThe core ethos of our research is to develop innovative solutions for economic and\\nenvironmental challenges, in line with Goal 9 of the Sustainable Development Goals, while\\nsearching for opportunities of application, commercialisation and knowledge transfer. Our staff\\nare involved in collaborations internationally and nationally, and our submitted outputs are co-\\nauthored with non-UK-based partners from 18 different countries.\\n4.1 Our research impacts public policy\\nMembers of our staff are involved with world-leading research which impacts public policy. One such\\nexample of this is the work of Dr Rabih Bashroush, who has played a key role in driving energy\\nefficiency in the design and operation of data centres and computer servers. His research has\\nimpacted various European policies such as the EU Environmental Management Audit Scheme\\n(EMAS) for Telecommunications and ICT Services sector and the new EU Green Public\\nProcurement (GPP) Criteria for Data Centres. Annual savings of over 27 thousand tons of CO2\\nequivalent emissions can be attributed to research and innovation projects led by Rabih.\\nSimilarly, Dr Ameer Al-Nemrat’s research on child exploitation has impacted specifically on digital\\nforensics methods to investigate child exploitation images at the Metropolitan Police. Internationally,\\nadvice has been sought by national security agencies, ministry administrators, including the\\nPortuguese National Security Cabinet, the Slovakian National Security Authority during the EU\\nSlovakian Presidency, and the Ministry of Interior in the United Arab Emirates.\\n4.2 Our research is innovative and collaborative\\n                                                                                             Page 10\\n\\n\\nOur principle of encouraging knowledge exchange has enabled us to enter collaborative research\\nwith industry. We have maximised this knowledge spill over into industry using patents. One such\\nexample is from Professor Mansour Moniri, who submitted a patent on his Spectral-360 system. This\\nwork aimed to address the issue of illumination variation in change detection algorithms. This\\nchallenge was addressed using a physics-based approach to model the spectral reflectance of\\nsurfaces. This novel technique (called Spectral-360) was patented [15] and rated amongst the top\\nfour best algorithms by IEEE Change Detection Workshop 2014.\\nThis research work was also substantiated through applications undertaken for London\\nUnderground, Staffordshire Police, Leicestershire Police and Defence Science and Technology\\nLaboratory (DSTL). For example, Spectral-360 enabled Staffordshire police to efficiently &\\naccurately prepare evidence to go to the court, this involved CCTV and video footages with severe\\nchanges in illumination conditions.\\nShareeful Islam has been funded by the Innovate UK academic start up accelerator programme to\\ndevelop a Cyber Insurability toolkit that can manage cyber-risk by assisting with decisions on suitable\\ncontrol strategies to mitigate cybersecurity risks.\\nOur staff have active research collaborations with international universities and industries:\\n• The Secure Software Engineering research group is collaborating with Ghent University\\n    (Belgium), Aalto University (Finland), Politecnico di Torino (Italy), Technical University Munich\\n    (Germany), NAGRA-Kudelski, and Thales.\\n• The Enterprise Computing research group is collaborating with Green IT Amsterdam, University\\n    of Leeds, Data Centre Trade Association, Carbon3IT, CBRE, Centre for Environmental Policy at\\n    Imperial College, KTH Stockholm (Sweden), and TU Wien (Austria).\\n• The Intelligent Systems research group is actively working with University of Southampton,\\n    University of Taxila (Pakistan), Queen Mary University of London, Intelligent Voice Ltd, King’s\\n    College London, NHS Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, University College London (UK), and\\n    Brunel University London.\\n4.3 Our research has international media reach\\nMany of our staff are highly active in engaging with the media. One such example is Dr Ameer Al-\\nNemrat who has frequent media appearances [21] and published articles on Sky News , BBC, Al-\\nJazeera [14], BBC Radio 4, The Times [13], providing commentary and opinions on the problems of\\ncybercrime and digital forensics.\\nAnother example involves Dr Rabih Bashroush who was invited by Dispatches (Channel 4's award-\\nwinning investigative current affairs TV programme) in 2020, as an expert on ICT sustainability for\\nthe episode “Is Your Online Habit Killing the Planet?” [4].\\nSimilarly, Dr Sin Wee Lee has been invited to be the subject expert on data analytics and the dark\\nweb on numerous occasions. He has been interviewed for his work across multiple media outlets,\\nincluding a front-page article in The Times [7], and further articles on BBC morning news\\nprogrammes, The Guardian [8], New Statesman [9], Daily Mail [10], International Business Times\\n[11], and the Express [12].\\n4.4 Our publications, invited talks and awards\\n                                                                                              Page 11\\n\\n\\nWe publish the outputs of our research in top-rated conferences (Conference and Workshop\\non Neural Information Processing (NeurIPS), IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural\\nNetworks, Interspeech) and journals including IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, IEEE Internet of\\nThings Journal, Elsevier Future Generation Computing Systems, Elsevier Expert Systems with\\nApplications, Elsevier Information Sciences, Elsevier Journal of Systems and Software, ACM\\nTransactions on Privacy and Security, IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing, and Springer’s\\nEmpirical Software Engineering.\\nOur staff are regularly invited to deliver talks and participate as panel members at research\\nconferences and major industrial forums. Some examples of these include:\\n•   Dr Paolo Falcarin was an invited speaker at the OWASP (Open Web Application Security\\n    Project) conference (2017), the Infosecurity conference (2018), and the IET Conference on\\n    Cyber Security and Systems Safety (2018). He was invited to attend a High-Level Workshop on\\n    the Network of Cybersecurity Competence Centres (2018), a wide consultation among\\n    cybersecurity experts in Europe on the creation of a European Research and Competence\\n    Centre and the definition of the cybersecurity topics for the post-H2020 EU research programme.\\n•   Dr Rabih Bashroush was invited as the keynote speaker to the International Workshop on\\n    Energy Efficient Data Centres (2017), to the Data Centres North industrial event (2016).

Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy\\n Context and structure\\n The Division of Computing Science and Mathematics (CSM) in the Faculty of Natural Sciences\\n combines cutting-edge, fundamental research in computational and mathematical techniques and\\n technologies, together with their application to addressing societal challenges in environment,\\n food, health, society and industry. Over the course of this REF period, CSM’s research structure\\n and staffing has met the aim set out in REF2014 “to push the boundaries of the levels of complexity\\n that we are able to model and handle” in order to tackle and solve difficult practical problems. To\\n achieve this, we refined our research group organisation (Figure 1) to promote the close working\\n of the computing scientists and mathematicians across CSM on research challenges. Focussing\\n collaborations with academics in other disciplines and close engagement with industry and the\\n public sector further enhances this cooperative approach. Highlights of our achievements include:\\n     •   Appointment of 8 new lecturers to broaden and consolidate our research strengths;\\n     •   Impact through optimisation of industrial scheduling and automated software bug fixing;\\n     •   Impact on public policy through predictive modelling of environmental issues;\\n     •   Significant research collaboration, with 80% of our REF-submitted outputs being with\\n         external collaborators, with 50% international across 14 countries;\\n     •   New technical capacity, including high performance computing (HPC) for data science, an\\n         internet of things (IoT) base station, and specialised hardware for low-power vision and\\n         audition.\\n We are a Division with a diverse collaborative network across the University of Stirling (UoS) and\\n globally. We have evolved to be the data-driven, computational engine at the heart of each of the\\n UoS’s three major research themes of Cultures, Communities and Society; Global Security and\\n Resilience; and Living Well. Through our pro-active agenda we lead on 25% (3 of 12) of the\\n university-wide research programmes underpinning these themes.\\n Our UoA B11 submission consists of 18 FTE staff from CSM. So extensive is our mission-oriented\\n collaborative approach that six CSM staff are submitted to four other UoAs where they have their\\n most intense research collaborations (A3: Allied Health; A6: Agriculture, Food and Veterinary\\n Sciences; C14: Environmental Studies; C20: Social Work and Social Policy).\\n We organise our research under three broad research groups (Figure 1):\\n     •   BIOlogical MODelling (BIOMOD) - predictive modelling of biological systems;\\n     •   DAta science and Intelligent Systems (DAIS) - data-driven modelling and analytics for\\n         wider applications in decision-support, scheduling and cyber-security; and\\n     •   COMputational Mathematics and OptimisatioN (COMMON) - the rigorous development of\\n         underpinning tools and techniques that are relevant to all application areas.\\n                                                                                              Page 1\\n\\n\\n Figure1: CSM research groups; porous boundaries with joint PGRs, grants and publications.\\n All three groups contain computer scientists and mathematicians developing new techniques and\\n their application. Collaboration between groups is encouraged, with a third of our grant\\n applications including more than one research group.\\n Biological modelling (BIOMOD). B11 members: Cairns, Kirpichnikova, Norman, Shankland; .\\n BIOMOD uses predictive modelling and optimisation techniques to describe, analyse and\\n understand biological and socio-economic processes. Major application areas are (1) disease\\n diagnosis, spread and control in human, animal and plant populations; and (2) global food security,\\n particularly identifying vulnerabilities in the food chain. A fundamental focus is on the application\\n of multiple approaches to single problems: for example, from population-based to individual\\n (agent)-based models of disease spread, allowing mathematical analysis and computer\\n simulations to provide complementary views on the same problem Underpinning this is the\\n development of new, fundamental techniques for model generation, parameterisation and\\n comparison. Antimicrobial resistance is a significant topic with cross-group collaboration with\\n DAIS.\\n Data Science and Intelligent Systems (DAIS). B11 members: Adair, Bhowmik, Graham,\\n Haraldsson, Linson, Ochoa, Noguiera, Swingler; plus Hapca (C20). DAIS innovates brain-inspired\\n computational techniques, evolutionary computation, signal processing, search and optimisation\\n methodologies and applies them to a wide range of real-world, data-driven challenges. Application\\n areas include assistive living, health and social care, cybersecurity, environmental systems and\\n resource scheduling. Specialist areas include: analysis and visualisation of fitness landscapes;\\n computational vision and image processing, including topics ranging from image watermarking for\\n media security to low power vision and contextual image segmentation; automated software\\n engineering and brain-inspired algorithms.\\n Computational Mathematics and Optimisation (COMMON). B11 members: Bracciali,\\n Brownlee, Kolberg, Lee, Li, Maier; plus Farkas (A3). COMMON conducts research in\\n computational and mathematical methods for solving complex dynamic problems, including\\n symbolic computation and exponential analysis for signal processing; efficient parallel\\n computation, metaheuristic and stochastic search methods (with cross-group collaborations with\\n DAIS); and blockchain technologies. Leveraging this fundamental research, we apply new\\n methods and techniques to solve difficult challenges in, for example, lung and skin cancer\\n detection, remote sensing data processing, scheduling in the aviation, building and other\\n                                                                                                Page 2\\n\\n\\n industries and power-efficient operation of computer and mobile networks (with cross-group\\n collaborations with BIOMOD). COMMON is a new research group that was formed in early 2019\\n to combine existing strengths in differential equation modelling and optimisation with significant\\n new expertise in important complementary domains, including signal processing and parallel\\n computation.\\n Research strategy\\n Our overall research strategy is to identify, understand and address complex societal challenges\\n using computational modelling and analysis. This is a core aim of each of the research groups. To\\n address this over-arching aim, we assemble within- and cross-group clusters of researchers to\\n develop solutions to challenges based on fundamental improvements in computational methods.\\n These methods typically combine traditional computational and mathematical techniques with\\n emerging data-driven approaches. The results are developed and deployed in close collaboration\\n with specialists in other academic disciplines and the ultimate end-users in the public sector and\\n industry. To fulfil this strategy, we work to satisfy the following two aims.\\n Aim 1: Develop new approaches to tackling complex societal challenges\\n Our research group structure and strategic staff appointments enables us to bring expertise in\\n data science, mathematical modelling, signal processing and optimisation, plus software and\\n hardware design for efficient computation to address complex challenges. Research groups\\n embody a spirit of openness that encourages the sharing of ideas and collaborative working, both\\n within and beyond individual RGs. This has led to joint publications and grant applications, plus\\n shared supervision of PhD and MSc students. Recent examples of the synergies we are exploiting\\n include:\\n     •   Multimodal data analysis for monitoring aquatic invasive weeds in India: Royal Academy\\n         of Engineering funded project (£300k) began in April 2020 involving DAIS and BIOMOD\\n         members, researchers from Biological and Environmental Sciences and Psychology at\\n         Stirling with external academic collaborators (U.K. and India) and other partners. Aquatic\\n         weeds cause major decline in food production, with 40% of available freshwater in India\\n         made unsuitable for fish production. This project uses computational modelling and image\\n         analysis to predict the extent of water hyacinth, which alone infests 20-25% of utilisable\\n         water in India. Serious gaming and other community engagement methods are used to\\n         assess damage caused by weed infestation to local communities and economies;\\n     •   Antimicrobial resistance is one of the top 10 threats to global health, as identified by the\\n         World Health Organization. Key to minimising this risk is optimising the use of antibiotics.\\n         Researchers from BIOMOD and DAIS, with collaborators in Stirling’s Institute of\\n         Aquaculture, are using predictive modelling and multi-objective optimisation techniques\\n         applied to scheduling of treatment to minimise the impact of antimicrobial resistance. Their\\n         prediction of new, more efficient treatment regimes that reduce antibiotic usage is gaining\\n         media attention (BBC radio interview plus Sunday Times article, Feb 2020);\\n     •   An integrated approach across our three groups is combining start-of-the-art signal\\n         processing techniques in exponential analysis with data driven methods to improve\\n         sensing data analysis in diverse applications from antenna array design to malaria risk\\n         detection where the challenge is to identify small water bodies from remote sensing data.\\n         This research is carried out with collaborators in Biological and Environmental Sciences\\n         Stirling. This work will greatly expand due to an EU Horizon 2020-funded EXPOWER\\n         research and innovation staff exchange network, beginning in April 2021, enabling\\n         collaboration with researchers in Belgium, Germany, France, Netherlands, USA, Canada,\\n         South Africa and Taiwan.\\n                                                                                               Page 3\\n\\n\\n Aim 2: Facilitate collaborative, interdisciplinary research\\n In addition to establishing a collegiate atmosphere that encourages collaboration within CSM, we\\n develop and nurture collaborations with other academics and stakeholders to identify and\\n understand complex challenges that can benefit from our approaches. Stirling’s ethos and scope\\n as an institution aids establishing close collaborative links across disciplines. We are highly\\n proactive in leveraging Stirling’s strengths in aquaculture, environmental sciences, health and\\n sports sciences, social sciences, psychology, business and management, law and philosophy to\\n add depth and range to our research. New contacts and collaborations have been formed through\\n concerted efforts to create and exploit interaction through cross-disciplinary “away days”,\\n participating in the annual Stirling Festival of Research and leading on university-wide research\\n programmes: Being Connected; Global Food Security and Contextual learning and processing in\\n humans and machines (CONTEXT)\\n These mechanisms, and the programmes, have provided the means to bring a broad range of\\n researchers together to discover the synergies that exist between disciplines, and what our data-\\n centric, computational perspective can bring to many areas. This has led to the submission of\\n larger, multidisciplinary grant applications. We have submitted 28% more applications but with a\\n rise of 177% in the value of bids per year since 2017.\\n Impact strategy\\n Impact lies at the heart of our research and we have further intensified impact within our research\\n culture through the Faculty Impact Strategy, which encompasses all researchers and research\\n students in the Faculty of Natural Sciences. This Strategy has three objectives:\\n     •    to improve impact literacy through training and the sharing of best practice;\\n     •    to enable identification of a wide range of potential and ambitious impact objectives;\\n     •    to maintain an impact support structure; and, to recognise and track impact as it happens.\\n To achieve these, we have a CMS Impact Champion who coordinates with the Faculty’s Associate\\n Dean of Impact and the Faculty Impact Committee. Our impact case study authors act as ‘impact\\n ambassadors’, sharing knowledge, skills, connections and insights gained during their journeys to\\n successful impact creation. This collaborative approach allows us to proactively identify and\\n respond to challenges/opportunities that arise from changes in circumstances. We share our best\\n practice and learn from others across the institution through engagement with Impact Champions\\n in other faculties and divisions and the institutional Impact Working Group. The importance of\\n impactful research for CSM is recognised and rewarded within our appraisal and development\\n process (Achieving Success), in our appointment criteria, and as a criterion for research leave.\\n An essential component of our impact strategy is continuing to widen our network of potential end-\\n users, so that projects and associated grant applications are formulated with end-user outcomes\\n built in from the outset. To support policy/societal impact we work with a range of collaborators\\n from other disciplines who provide links to appropriate policy makers and stakeholders. To\\n increase our industry contact base, we maintain an extensive Industrial Advisory Board, that\\n currently has representatives from 40 local businesses; and we run targeted business\\n engagement events, such as our “Computer Vision Showcase” at Stirling in March 2019 that was\\n supported by the Scottish CENSIS Innovation Centre. We have embedded industrial links and\\n research into our teaching through our Graduate Apprenticeship scheme, our MSc programmes\\n in Big Data which have several students funded annually through the Scottish Data Lab who do\\n their dissertations with Industry, and our Professional Doctorate. All these opportunities allow staff\\n to interact with different types of industry and to develop relationships and research ideas with\\n them. Interface, a Scottish Funding Council (SFC)-funded organisation, provides a “match-\\n making” service with local businesses seeking academic partnerships. Potential partnerships from\\n Interface are directed to relevant academics in CSM by our partner in the university’s Research\\n                                                                                                Page 4\\n\\n\\n Office, and partnerships resulting from these have led to several of the successful Innovation\\n Vouchers listed below.\\n Impact is also being fostered through Stirling’s active membership of the Scottish Informatics and\\n Computer Science Alliance (SICSA) research pool, which coordinates interaction with industry\\n through its business development executive and programmes. SICSA’s annual DemoFest brings\\n together researchers at an early stage with commerce and business leaders, where CSM\\n researchers and PhD students regularly present their work.\\n The success of this integrated approach to impact awareness and generation is exemplified by\\n our two impact case studies that involve the work of all three research groups:\\n The impact case study on the use of metaheuristics to improve software performance and process\\n scheduling involves researchers from COMMON and DAIS and is a direct outcome of EPSRC\\n funded research (DAASE project). It is a study led by two of our recent appointments to open\\n ended positions who were employed as postdoctoral researchers on the DAASE project and who\\n were both able to use their own links with industry and their leadership on the impact agenda to\\n enhance their applications for the open-ended posts in a very competitive environment. They were\\n supported by two more experienced staff members who, as well as their academic contribution,\\n provided strong networks of industrial partners. The strength of this impact case study is the ability\\n of these staff members to translate their cutting-edge research into results which are valued and\\n used by the industrial partners.\\n Our impact case study on environmental sustainability has arisen from research in BIOMOD and\\n through an Innovation Voucher enquiry as described above. The other impact described in the\\n study comes from a large body of work and long-standing interdisciplinary collaboration with\\n colleagues in the biological sciences including collaborators from the James Hutton Institute and\\n the Centre for Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Science who have both supported\\n pathways to policy makers and have meant that the research has contributed to policy decisions\\n by the Scottish Government.\\n Impactful research is pump-primed through a mixture of University and external resources:\\n     •   Match-funded PhD studentships, in part facilitated through the Scottish Data Lab and\\n         CENSIS Innovation Centres, with the university research programmes and match-funding\\n         rounds. Recent examples include match-funding from major companies (BT Research, ST\\n         Microelectronics), SMEs (Singapore-based FinTech company, Bambu) and publically-\\n         funded bodies (Scotland’s Rural College: 3 studentships).\\n     •   Scottish Funding Council Innovation Voucher projects with local companies which aim to\\n         provide proof of concept for larger follow-on grants. New appointees since 2017 have been\\n         particularly successful here:\\n             o A £5k Innovation Voucher in 2020 with Falcon Foodservice Equipment, has now\\n                 led to £60k follow-on project which began in November 2020;\\n             o A £5k SFC Innovation Voucher with Airspace Unlimited Scotland Ltd in 2020 has\\n                 led to follow on £75k Innovate UK funded project which began in October 2020;\\n             o Four other Innovation vouchers have been awarded in the last two years and we\\n                 are currently following up on that work.\\n     •   Other available small-grant mechanisms involving companies and organisations. Recent\\n         examples are:\\n             o A £48k grant from the EPSRC Internet of Food Things network for the pilot project\\n                 “Use of sensors to improve pig productivity” in collaboration with the Scottish Pig\\n                 Producers Association and the Agri-Epi centre in Edinburgh;\\n                                                                                               Page 5\\n\\n\\n              o   A £27k proof-of-concept grant from Samordningsförbundet Centrala Östergötland,\\n                  Sweden to work with Swedish and Icelandic (Janus Rehabilitation) collaborators\\n                  on the “Rehabilitation Pathway Generator”, with the aim of this leading to longer\\n                  term research and development and wider application e.g. in the NHS in the UK;\\n              o   A £24k Innovate UK grant with Digiland on the use of blockchain technologies for\\n                  financial inclusion in Bangladesh;\\n              o   A £100k award from the Defence and Security Accelerator competition for the\\n                  project, “Deep Learning for Depth-Based Image Segmentation”.\\n              o\\n      •   Scottish Funding Council Global Challenges Research funding administered by the\\n          University\\n              o £5k networking grant to support collaboration with India, which led to a £25k Royal\\n                  Academy of Engineering networking grant and then the £300k project on invasive\\n                  weeds in India described above\\n              o £25k and £33k grants looking at the use of Earth Observation to understand the\\n                  extent and impact of floods and droughts in Bangladesh and the subsequent impact\\n                  on food security and health, including covid-19.\\n The key to our impact strategy is to make awareness of impact a day-to-day activity in our\\n research. The university’s research planning system, WorkTribe, provides facilities for recording\\n impact from projects. Realising and recording long-term impact requires time and effort that is\\n recognised as a legitimate research activity and resourced accordingly with dedicated staff time\\n and administration support.\\n Future strategic directions\\n Through our research and staffing strategy, we have established several major areas of multi-\\n disciplinary strength providing a focus for new and early career staff to flourish and ensure their\\n progression to senior researchers\\n .\\n Research in computational techniques will emphasise:\\n      •   Optimisation: techniques (particularly meta-heuristic) and applications to model\\n          parameter fitting, automated software engineering, scheduling problems. This builds on\\n          existing strengths, continuing the type of work underpinning our impact case study on\\n          application of optimisation. All three research groups are involved in development and use\\n          of optimisation;\\n      •   Data-driven predictive modelling: melding traditional mathematical modelling with\\n          computational and data analytic approaches. This will build particularly on the focus of the\\n          BIOMOD group but also draw on expertise from DAIS and COMMON. The aim is to be\\n          able to build better predictive models by creating techniques that automate model\\n          development, drawing upon machine learning and formal computational methods. This\\n          broadly includes most of the researchers in CSM;\\n      •   Vision and image processing: new methods for extracting useful information from\\n          imaging data obtained from a range of devices including digital cameras and remote\\n          sensing in different frequency bands. Work with Biological and Environmental Sciences\\n          BES is creating new techniques in contextual image processing and signal extraction from\\n          sparse data to maximise the information that can be obtained from very large-scale remote\\n          sensing data. Collaboration with psychologists is bringing a biological perspective to\\n          improve computational vision.\\n Fitting with the university’s research themes and building on our recent work, new computational\\n techniques will be co-developed to solve challenges particularly in two broad application areas in\\n which we are making advances:\\n                                                                                               Page 6\\n\\n\\n     •    Food security: all three foci of our computational techniques are being brought to bear on\\n          issues that affect the security of our food chains. Building and optimising models of\\n          components of the food chain to enable identification of key risk points and make\\n          predictions of interventions to manage risks are the major aims;\\n     •    Improving health and well-being: All the computational techniques are applied to\\n          generate increased understanding of societal health risks and to help provide solutions.\\n          This ranges from predicting disease spread, to diagnosing disease from medical images,\\n          to enhanced assistive devices to improve quality of life.\\n Within these application areas we will place a strong emphasis not just on technological solutions\\n to problems, but the entire deployment lifecycle: impact, sustainability, socio-economic effects,\\n legal issues. We will do this through our ongoing approach of creating multi and inter-disciplinary\\n teams to work on projects, combining technology with sociology, law, management and other\\n disciplines.\\n Section 2. People\\n Staffing strategy and staff development\\n Our strategic emphasis is on recruiting and developing staff to strengthen existing areas and to\\n add complementary new skills. University investment in our success has allowed us to make eight\\n new appointments at lecturer level since 2017. These appointments have strengthened our\\n existing research expertise and expanded our range. Expansion includes posts in cybersecurity\\n (Bhowmik, Brownlee), plus appointments in computational and mathematical methods for signal\\n processing and parallel computation (Lee, Maier), data analytics and machine learning (Adair,\\n Nogueira). Continuing strengths in optimisation (Haraldsson) and predictive modelling\\n (Kirpichnikova) have been boosted.\\n We have a strong record in nurturing staff from an early career stage through to professorships.\\n Of the current cohort of four professors, three are due to promotions within this REF period, all\\n having started initially as lecturers in CSM. For the first time the professorships in CSM (and B11)\\n are now held by a majority of women (Norman, Ochoa, Shankland). In the face of strong, world-\\n wide competition, three CSM PDRAs were appointed on merit to the new lectureships (Adair,\\n Brownlee, Haraldsson), highlighting the quality of the training they have received in CSM and their\\n desire to pursue careers in the academic environment that CSM provides.\\n The strength of our research culture and nurturing environment was recognised at a university\\n level in April 2019 with the appointment of Norman (BIOMOD) as Institutional Dean of Research\\n Engagement and Performance to promote a positive and collaborative research environment\\n which helps everyone to reach their potential.\\n The CSM management structure ensures that all divisional needs, including research activity, are\\n suitably planned and resourced. The Executive group oversees all divisional activities and\\n comprises the Head of Division, Director of Learning and Teaching, Director of Research, and\\n Director of Research Postgraduates. This group meets fortnightly to ensure the demands of\\n research, teaching and administration are effectively met. Adjoining these planning meetings,\\n open divisional meetings are held in the informal environment of the divisional coffee room, at\\n which all staff can come to raise and discuss any issues with the Executive.\\n The Research Committee comprises the Director of Research, Research Group leaders, Director\\n of Research Postgraduates, REF coordinators (including Impact), early career researchers and\\n research postgraduate representatives, and others on invitation or request. The Committee meets\\n monthly to oversee research-related matters, such as resource allocation and planning, and PGR\\n progression.\\n This management structure supports efficient and effective planning, with clear lines of\\n communication for all members of CSM. Decision-making is open to scrutiny and anyone can raise\\n matters of concern and agenda items for the Executive or Research Committee. The Divisional\\n Research Strategy is maintained as a live document and is further shaped by open discussions\\n during annual research away days and during the regular Research Group meetings.\\n In addition to sharing of ideas and active research, the three research groups provide a fostering\\n environment particularly for early career researchers, including:\\n                                                                                               Page 7\\n\\n\\n     • Grant proposal formulation and early-stage review;\\n     • Paper writing early-stage review;\\n     • Sandpits to generate new research initiatives;\\n     • Mix of skills: grant writing, paper writing, technical, outreach, impact;\\n     • Exposure of PDRAs to wider perspectives on managing research;\\n     • Celebration of success and sharing of progress in a supportive team environment.\\n A variety of mechanisms are used to facilitate staff development and enable staff to set and\\n achieve personal goals, in keeping with university and divisional aims and strategy:\\n     • Careful time management through workload modelling is aimed at ensuring that all staff\\n        have appropriate dedicated research time, ranging from 100% for PDRAs to at least 40%\\n        for individuals on Research and Teaching contracts, at all stages of career progression.\\n        Research time is further prioritised for new / early career staff and those with significant\\n        grant income, altering the balance in favour of research time;\\n     • The annual “Achieving Success” process is used to support staff in all aspects of their\\n        academic endeavours, including planning for and achieving their best possible career\\n        trajectory. A personal plan for the coming year (with thought to longer term goals) is\\n        developed in consultation with their line manager (Head of Division). The emphasis is on\\n        ensuring that staff have clearly defined goals, and that any barriers to achieving these\\n        goals are identified and can be minimised through planning and resource allocation at the\\n        individual and divisional / faculty level;\\n     • Training and refresher sessions for new and experienced staff in effective PhD supervision\\n        is encouraged, particularly through training sessions organised by the university’s Institute\\n        of Advanced Studies, which oversees all aspects of PGR training;\\n     • Senior and progressing staff are facilitated to undergo management training programmes.\\n        For example, four staff have gone through the award winning, institutional specific ILM\\n        level 5 leadership and management training. Two of our staff regularly contribute to the\\n        Aurora programme, which is Advance HE’s leadership development initiative for women,\\n        as role models, mentors and presenters. Several staff have also undertaken that\\n        programme;\\n     • All staff, but particularly early career staff are encouraged to take part in the locally run\\n        Stirling crucible which provides training and network opportunities;\\n     • All research-active staff are encouraged to apply for research leave to enable generation\\n        of new grant proposals, research outputs and impact. Applications can be made every\\n        seventh semester and are only successful if the research plan has clear, achievable goals.\\n        Plans are carefully reviewed by the Research Committee, in consultation with the\\n        Executive, to ensure divisional needs are met, before presentation to the Dean of Faculty\\n        for approval;\\n     • Early career and all new staff have a mentor within the Division. All staff may have a\\n        mentor, on request. Such mentors may come from outside the Division, allowing staff to\\n        gain wider views of academic life;\\n     • Strong support is given for individual fellowship applications, particularly for early career\\n        staff and postdoctoral fellows on fixed-term contracts: we work closely with the university’s\\n        Research and Innovation Services to ensure appropriate schemes are targeted and key\\n        expectations of funders are met. Robust peer review is carried out for all applications.\\n        Excellent proposals attract extra university support, as needed, including potential for on-\\n        going appointments beyond the end of fellowships, and PhD studentships being attached\\n        to the fellowship. For example, Norman secured teaching-buyout during the period of 1\\n        Sept 2019 to 31 Aug 2021, via a Leverhulme Research Fellowship.\\n Research students\\n We provide a collegiate atmosphere in which PhD students are fully integrated in research activity\\n through CSM research group and PhD cohort activities. The Director of Postgraduate Research\\n maintains oversight and direction of PhD recruitment, supervision and training activities.\\n                                                                                              Page 8\\n\\n\\n University-wide postgraduate research (PGR) community development and training are facilitated\\n through the university’s Institute of Advanced Studies.\\n All students have a principal and second supervisor. Supervisory meetings are recorded by the\\n student on the web-based Research Compass system. Each year, students produce an annual\\n report detailing progress to date and plans for completion. This report is then the subject of a viva,\\n conducted by two academics who are not members of the supervisory committee. This viva is\\n attended by supervisors, who monitor proceedings and may be consulted separately by the\\n examiners.\\n PGR students gain wider experience and participation in CSM through the following activities:\\n      •  Postgraduates are represented on CSM research and teaching committees;\\n      •  Students participate in research group activities, including seminars, discussion groups,\\n         peer review sessions. They are encouraged to try out conference presentations in these\\n         groups and to obtain peer review of outputs before submission;\\n      •  Students run their own research and social meeting group, PGTips, which provides mutual\\n         support, an informal discussion forum, and opportunity for initial peer review;\\n      •  Students in the unit run an annual PhD day, which is a mix of poster and oral presentation\\n         of their work to CSM;\\n      •  A Computing Science and Mathematics Skills (COSMoS) forum, was initiated by the\\n         students, who identified the need for exposure to new skills and technologies particular to\\n         our discipline. Sessions presented by students and staff have ranged from using Latex for\\n         document preparation, to Bayesian statistical methods, to time management for research;\\n      •  Further training, including thesis writing and career development, is available through\\n         workshops run by the university’s Institute of Advances Studies;\\n      •  Students compete in the Institute of Advanced Studies annual “Three-minute thesis”\\n         competition, which hones skills in conveying complex research topics to a diverse\\n         audience and in a concise manner;\\n      •  Students also participate in Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance (SICSA)\\n         events, including the annual PhD conference and the DemoFest outreach event. In 2019,\\n         Stirling students and staff organised and hosted the SICSA PhD conference.\\n We take advantage of match-funding for PGR recruitment through opportunities provided by the\\n university and external bodies such as the Scottish Data Lab Innovation Centre, with 25% of the\\n current cohort on match-funded studentships. Such studentships are a priority for developing first-\\n stage research with impact and in training the next wave of researchers in how to conduct a\\n research project in close collaboration with end-users. Students gain significant experience in the\\n different cultures and expectations of industry and business.\\n In addition, we established a Professional Doctorate in Big Data Science that has admitted its first\\n students in 2020. This has a taught component in the first year, for which funded places are\\n available through the Scottish Data Lab. The programme is strongly focussed on research projects\\n in direct collaboration with business and industry.\\n Equality and diversity\\n We have an academic appointed as the Equality and Diversity Officer for CSM, and they are\\n responsible for ensuring staff are aware of training and support possibilities in this area that the\\n university and external organisations may offer. They are proactive in ascertaining issues that\\n arise within CSM, and this is a standing agenda item at Divisional meetings.\\n The University’s commitment to gender equality was recognised in the institutional Athena SWAN\\n Bronze award in 2016. CSM is further committed to achieving Departmental Athena Swan\\n recognition, and we are working towards applying for this in November 2021.\\n                                                                                                Page 9\\n\\n\\n We have improved awareness of the conscious and unconscious biases that affect all stages of\\n recruitment and advancement in research with training for staff on these panels. In addition, our\\n approach to recruitment recognises alternative career paths to becoming a researcher in\\n computing science, and all panel members are made aware of the potential bias towards non-\\n standard routes to academic research, and of the equivalent value of administrative and pastoral\\n care duties that may have disproportionally impacted women. Our selection criteria also recognise\\n the value of candidates who have made progress in their academic and research careers whilst\\n balancing family and caring commitments, or health and other restrictions.\\n We have established a diverse cohort of researchers, with staff from Scotland, England, Ireland,\\n India, Italy, Russia, Taiwan, Australia, West Indies, USA, Venezuela, Germany, China, Romania,\\n Brazil. A third of CSM permanent staff are female, including 3 of 4 professors (8/24).\\n The mental health of our staff and students is paramount and underpins planning of work\\n arrangements. Senior CSM staff run informal sessions presenting their own experiences and\\n inviting discussion, promoting the realisation that mental health issues can affect anyone. The\\n Achieving Success process enables staff to raise and discuss barriers to success, including\\n achieving a suitable work/life balance and coping with the stresses of their careers. This has been\\n vital during the 2020/1 Covid-19 pandemic, and staff have been able to review and revise their\\n goals set during Achieving Success in 2019 to reflect the changes in work practices and day-to-\\n day living that have been necessary.\\n The PGR Director has identified mental health as a key issue for our PGR students and is working\\n with them to create a supportive community that prevents students becoming isolated and unable\\n to deal with the pressures of their studies. This has been particularly important during 2020, with\\n students not able to meet in person. Weekly on-line meetings are used to provide a sense of\\n community and ensure students do not feel socially isolated from their peers.\\n Flexible working is encouraged through largely informal arrangements, but also by timetabling\\n meetings in core hours (10am to 4pm) to allow staff to fulfil family commitments, such as child/adult\\n care. University infrastructure facilitates remote working through a comprehensive web portal,\\n including secure file sharing. By agreement we restrict expectations to responding to emails to\\n basic working hours (9am to 6pm).\\n Section 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n Income\\n Income is principally from UKRI (EPSRC, BBSRC), Academies (Royal Academy of Engineering,\\n Academy of Medical Sciences) and charitable trusts (Carnegie, Leverhulme). Large grant\\n applications target GCRF/ODA funding (CSM members are both PIs and CIs on recent bids) and\\n EU Horizon 2020. Most grants are collaborative in nature, involving external academic\\n investigators and end-user stakeholders. Highlights of major funding led by CSM during the REF\\n period:\\n EPSRC Programme grant (2012 - 2019, £2.4M Stirling), “DAASE: Dynamic Adaptive Automated\\n Software Engineering” involved a consortium of universities including UCL, Birmingham and York.\\n It also engaged with a range of stakeholders including ABB Group, Berner and Mattner, BT\\n Laboratories, Ericsson, GCHQ, Honda, IBM, Microsoft Research, Motorola and Northrop\\n Grumman Air Park Systems and Air France/KLM.\\n      •   CSM contributed world-leading research in meta-heuristic optimisation techniques to this\\n          project, which forms the basis of our “optimisation” impact case study. Ochoa was\\n          promoted from lecturer to professor during the lifetime of the grant, and key researchers\\n          Brownlee and Haraldsson are new lecturer appointments, ensuring the sustainability of\\n          this research in CSM beyond the duration of this project.\\n                                                                                              Page 10\\n\\n\\n Royal Academy of Engineering funded project (2020 - 2023, Stirling £300k), “Multimodal data\\n analysis for monitoring aquatic invasive weeds in India” includes collaborators in Psychology and\\n Biological Sciences with external collaborators and partners in both the U.K. and India.\\n     •   Direct result of workshop funded by an Academy of Medical Sciences Networking grant.\\n         Brings together expertise in earth observation and computational modelling.\\n EPSRC AV-CogHear project grant (2015 - 2019, Stirling £300k), “Towards Visually-driven Speech\\n Enhancement For Cognitively-inspired Multi-modal Hearing-aid Devices” in collaboration with\\n University of Sheffield, MRC Institute of Hearing Research and Phonak Hearing Systems.\\n     •   Established a focus on multi-modal machine learning in CSM and this is now a well-\\n         established theme within the DAIS research group.\\n BBSRC project grant (2013-2016, Stirling £240k), “Balancing resource and energy usage for\\n optimal performance in a neural system” in collaboration with Universities of Leicester and\\n Edinburgh.\\n     •   Crossed the boundaries of the DAIS and BIOMOD research groups to consider an aspect\\n         of nervous systems that is relevant to building efficient artificial neural networks.\\n EPSRC project grant (2016-2019, Stirling £150k), “TRANSIT: Towards A Robust Airport Decision\\n Support System for Intelligent Taxiing” in collaboration with Queen Mary (lead) and Lincoln\\n University and external stakeholders.\\n     •   Complemented DAASE with work on optimisation for complex scheduling.\\n Leverhulme research grant (2016-2018, Stirling £100k), “The Cartography of Computational\\n Search Spaces”\\n     •   Fundamental theoretical work underpinning optimisation research in DAASE project and\\n         DAIS and COMMON research groups.\\n Leverhulme Research Fellowship (2019-2021, £55k): “Developing a theoretical understanding of\\n non-linearities in the food system and practical ideas to take advantage of them”\\n     •   Will identify risks in the current food system and what action is needed to avoid them. The\\n         non-linearities include trade-offs, feedback loops and tipping points.\\n To complement large grant bids and diversify our funding base, we encourage bids to smaller\\n grant mechanisms, such as Carnegie Research Incentive grants and industrial-based contracts\\n through e.g. Innovate UK, Scottish Funding Council (SFC) Innovation Vouchers and focussed\\n grant calls. This is particularly helping new members of staff to establish their research\\n programmes, such as the examples given in Section 1 under “Impact strategy”, plus:\\n     •   A £15k Carnegie Research Incentive Grant (2021 to 2022) to consolidate work on\\n         exponential analysis;\\n     •   A £10k Carnegie Research Incentive Grant (2019 to 2020) to consolidate work on genetic\\n         improvement of software (impact case study).\\n Infrastructure and Facilities\\n Specialist research infrastructure centres around high-performance computing facilities for\\n computationally intensive model simulation and data analytics, plus related hardware for data\\n collection and processing of visual, auditory and remote sensor signals:\\n                                                                                               Page 11\\n\\n\\n In 2019, CSM became home to an Internet-of-Things (IoT) base-station, provided courtesy of IoT\\n Scotland. Boston networks provides the infrastructure which is being rolled out across Scotland.\\n This gateway enables acquiring sensor signals within a 20-mile radius. This is facilitating\\n interdisciplinary collaboration with researchers collecting “in-the-field” sensor data, in Aquaculture\\n and Biological and Environmental Sciences with CSM providing data processing resources,\\n including state-of-the-art data analytics via machine learning and optimisation techniques.\\n This facility will play a significant role in the new Scottish International Environment Centre which\\n is receiving investment of £22m through the Stirling and Clackmannanshire City Region Growth\\n Deal. Through the Environment Centre, the IoT base-station will be complemented by the new\\n Forth Valley 5G Innovation Hub, launched in September 2020. These facilities will support the\\n Forth Environmental Resilience Array (Forth-ERA) project which will involve the capture,\\n processing and sharing of data from across Forth Valley using EE’s 5G network. Sensors, satellite\\n data and artificial intelligence will be used to provide vital information on water quality and other\\n factors to inform decisions that could provide major economic and sustainability benefits to the\\n area. This innovative, cross-disciplinary and cross sectoral approach – bringing together science,\\n research, business and regulation – will be a global exemplar of green recovery, which is easily\\n scaled and could be replicated worldwide. Forth-ERA will work alongside several regional\\n stakeholders, including: the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), Scottish Water,\\n Diageo, NatureScot, Forth Estuary Forum and Forth Valley Chamber of Commerce.\\n Other specialist facilities in CSM include a Computational Intelligence lab that houses hardware\\n for low-power vision (cameras and FPGA) and audition (silicon cochlea), with a sound-proof\\n recording studio. Projects looking at real-time visual object detection and sound-source\\n localisation are being undertaken with this hardware.\\n Research-specific high-performance computing in CSM includes two large servers that address\\n different computational needs. Firstly, a new server has been funded by the Faculty of Natural\\n Sciences, Stirling, in 2018 specifically for very large memory requirement and GPU-compatible\\n data analysis and provides 768 GB of RAM, 32 CPU cores and 32 TB of data storage. It is\\n equipped with 4 Nvidia 1080Ti graphics cards to train and apply Deep Learning Neural Network\\n methods. While used heavily within CSM, it is available to any Stirling researcher who needs such\\n computational specifications. It is facilitating collaborative work between CSM and other\\n researchers at Stirling, such as from Biological and Environmental Sciences. The other HPC\\n facility is a cluster with 120 CPU cores, used extensively for parameter searching and optimisation\\n tasks involving GAs/EAs. This was originally funded by an EPSRC project grant but has been\\n maintained for all to use. We have two full-time computing staff to run and maintain these facilities.\\n In addition, Stirling is a partner in, and user of, the ARCHIE-WeSt supercomputer facility housed\\n at Strathclyde University.\\n Open access is a priority for all research outputs, with the University paying publication fees for\\n journal papers to enable this. All outputs are placed in a Stirling’s On-line Research Repository\\n (STORRE). In addition, it is strongly encouraged that research data and other research outputs,\\n such as computer code, are made freely available through depositing in the University’s data store\\n (DataSTORRE) and by distribution on publicly accessible forums, such as GitHub (for computer\\n code).\\n Section 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society\\n Collaboration\\n CSM research is highly collaborative and we generate and work with collaborative groupings over\\n a range of domains: within the University and both nationally and internationally with other\\n academic institutions and with a range of industry, policy and public stakeholders.\\n Most of our research is undertaken in collaboration with internal and external academic and stake-\\n holder partners. Academic collaborators include UCL, Sheffield, York, Queen Mary, Lincoln,\\n                                                                                                Page 12\\n\\n\\n Edinburgh, Glasgow, Strathclyde, Birmingham and others, principally in Europe and North\\n America. We regularly host research visits from international academics, including visitors from\\n Canada, USA, France, Belgium, India, South Africa, Switzerland, Spain, Mexico, Finland, Brazil,\\n Algeria, Germany, Lithuania, Denmark.\\n Scotland-wide interactions are significantly facilitated by our membership of SICSA. New contacts\\n are made, and research activity generated through the SICSA research themes and associated\\n workshops. Bhowmik is a SICSA Cybersecurity research theme leader. Shankland led the SICSA\\n modelling, and abstraction research theme (2012-2016) and Smith (now retired) was a SICSA\\n Artificial Intelligence research theme leader. We have run SICSA-supported workshops on:\\n     •    Real-world transport optimisation (January 2015);\\n     •    Artificial intelligence (May 2016).\\n Funded stake-holder interactions include BT, KLM-Air France, Janus Rehabilitation (Iceland), ST\\n Microelectronics, Falcon Foodservice Equipment, DEFRA, DASA, Forestry Commission, Phonak\\n AG, Fera Science Ltd, Bambu (Singapore), Scottish Rural College (SRUC), Unitech Ltd, UCare\\n Foundation, Marine Science Support and others. These interactions have funded PhD\\n studentships and produced high-quality academic outputs and technologies that are being\\n deployed by the stakeholders (as evidenced in our impact case studies).\\n To widen our links, particularly internationally, CSM researchers have been involved in setting up\\n and running funded research networks. These researchers:\\n     •    have used an Academy of Medical Sciences GCRF Networking £24k grant, in collaboration\\n          with the National Institute of Plant Health Management, Hyderabad, India, to run a\\n          workshop in India in April 2019 on “Protecting Food Security in SE Asian Countries by\\n          Developing Early-Warning and Ready-Response Systems for Invasive Weed Incursions”.\\n          This has now led to a £300k grant from the Royal Academy of Engineering to carry out a\\n          substantive project (see Section 3);\\n     •    chair HPC-enabled Modelling for Life Sciences, in the EU Horizon 2020 cHiPSet Cost\\n          Action on High-Performance Modelling and Simulation for Big Data Applications, involving\\n          30+ countries (http://chipset-cost.eu/);\\n     •    are PI on the EPSRC-funded “Predictive Modelling for Healthcare Technologies through\\n          Maths (POEMS)” network, with Manchester and Sheffield.

These attract a diverse audience of around 50 people over a wide age-range from the\\n local community. They are a prime mechanism for instilling enthusiasm in computing science and\\n mathematics as subjects to study for school-age children, and to stimulate interest in\\n undergraduates in the research possibilities in these fields.\\n Conclusion\\n CSM continues to foster a dynamic and sustainable research environment in which computer\\n scientists and mathematicians work together on solving complex challenges facing today’s\\n societies, in food and health, the environment, business and social organisation. Predictive\\n modelling and data science include many valuable computational approaches to help tackle these\\n challenges in our data-rich world. We are building our capacity in developing and exploiting such\\n techniques and to further strengthen our interdisciplinary and stakeholder links so that our work\\n continues to have significant scientific and practical impact over the long term.\\n                                                                                           Page 15\\n', 'w_env']\n",

      "['University of Birmingham\\n 1. Context and mission\\n Founded in 1900, The University of Birmingham (UoB) is a civic, research-intensive\\n University with a strong global footprint. Our goal is to use our strengths in research and\\n education to find solutions to the big problems of our day, increasing well-being, social\\n mobility and prosperity globally and locally.\\n The University comprises around 36,900 students (22,500 UG, 11,000 PGT; 3,400 PGR)\\n and 8,500 staff, (2,700 academic staff, 1,560 REF-eligible). A founder member of the\\n Russell Group and Universitas 21, we regularly rank among the top 100 in major\\n international league tables.\\n We have one of the broadest disciplinary bases of any UK university, submitting to 28\\n UOAs in REF2021. Structurally, UoB is divided into 5 academic Colleges: Medical and\\n Dental Sciences (MDS; Main Panel A (MPA)), Engineering and Physical Sciences (EPS;\\n MPB), Life and Environmental Sciences (LES; MPs A, B and C), Social Sciences (CoSS;\\n MPC) and Arts and Law (CAL; MPs D and C). The latter 4 Colleges are further divided\\n into 4 to 7 Schools, the lowest level of budgetary academic unit. In 2015, MDS reorganised\\n into an 8-Institute structure to reflect its key research priorities. Most disciplines are\\n mature; Pharmacy is the only new area that we are submitting compared to previous\\n REF/RAE exercises.\\n As a measure of research volume, UoB’s annual number of research publications\\n increased from 4,799 in 2014 to 5,734 in 2019 (Section 2), while our research income has\\n increased from £112m to £151m (Section 4).\\n The University is located within the West Midlands, population 5.6m. The city of\\n Birmingham, population 1.08m, has greater economic inequality than any other British city\\n and high ethnic diversity (53% White British).

The launch of the European consortium EUniWell in 2019 involving UoB\\n has resulted in a €5m Erasmus+ award to support wellbeing-related collaboration.\\n Our China Institute has facilitated new partnership development, including a ¥6m\\n microparticles initiative with Jiangsu Industry Technology Research, and increased\\n collaborations leveraged through bases in Guangzhou and Nanjing, with enhanced\\n outputs and grant capture. Our India Institute has improved visibility and profile,\\n significantly increasing joint publications with Indian partners in the top 10% of highly-cited\\n outputs, and stimulating greater grant capture and formal agreements to develop major\\n collaborations, notably with Haryana State Government. Our 10-year engagement in\\n Brazil has yielded resilient, impactful partnerships, notably through the UoB-FAPESP fund\\n that created a pipeline for external grants, including a £2M MRC/Newton/FAPESP award\\n for the UK-Brazil Joint Centre for Arbovirus with Sao Paulo University. A strategic\\n partnership with Waseda University in Japan features collaboration from Shakespeare to\\n Robotics.\\n 2.2 Research Integrity and Open Research\\n We are committed to maintaining high standards of scholarly and scientific integrity in our\\n research, with policy development led by the Research, Governance, Ethics and Integrity\\n Committee, chaired by the PVC (R&KT), and supported by the RGEI office (8 FTE). We\\n adhere to the 5 commitments of the UK National Concordat, setting expectations and a\\n governance framework in our Code of Practice for Research. We publish an annual\\n Research Integrity Statement outlining our processes, and integrity features in PGR\\n courses and staff inductions, including bespoke discipline-based activities and online\\n training for researchers and distance learners. The Clinical Research Compliance Team\\n (6.4 FTE) delivers proactive, expert support for research involving human participants that\\n is subject to external regulatory standards, ensuring responsibilities under the UK Policy\\n                                                                                          Page 4\\n\\n\\n Framework for Health and Social Care Research are undertaken effectively and efficiently\\n with appropriate ethical review.\\n We are increasingly prioritising Open Research (OR), which in turn facilitates testing of\\n reproducibility, and are a signatory of DORA. The Open Research Board focuses on\\n developing initiatives beyond compliance to reap the benefits of OR.\\n The Scholarly Communications team supports our open data repository (4.5) accessed\\n via the Pure CRIS system, manages the University’s Gold Open Access funds and\\n provides guidance on Green Open Access. The Library Research Support Team runs\\n workshops and online courses on OR, and when negotiating journal subscriptions, we\\n prioritise Open Access provisions within licence agreements.\\n 2.3 Interdisciplinary research\\n 2.3.1 We aim to support, recognise and reward interdisciplinary research. The Institute\\n for Advanced Studies (IAS) and Institute for Global Innovation (IGI) together provide a\\n framework for developing interdisciplinary research from idea generation to securing\\n funding and output production. Additionally, there are numerous interdisciplinary centres\\n (see research centres) at local level.\\n 2.3.2 The IAS facilitates ‘bottom-up’ interdisciplinary networking through workshops and\\n talks, international visiting fellowships, funding and engagement with end users. Support\\n from IAS led to the development of the Institute for Mental Health, National Centre for\\n Nuclear Robotics and the Centre for Human Brain Health.\\n 2.3.3 The IGI, launched in 2018, takes a challenge-led, mission-driven approach to\\n interdisciplinary research, aiming to inspire, facilitate and deliver research addressing\\n pressing global challenges. Harnessing the breadth of UoB research, it has raised nearly\\n £20m in research funding, including £5.7m from the GCRF, and promotes four main\\n themes: Gender Inequality, Resilient Cities, Water Challenges and Transnational Crime,\\n alongside emerging themes. The IGI enables scholars from multiple disciplines, financially\\n and logistically, to generate holistic responses to challenges and connect with scholars\\n and stakeholders in LMICs, ensuring diverse global perspectives are incorporated into our\\n research culture.\\n 2.4 New Strategic Framework\\n Building on the success of the last 5 years, our draft Strategic Framework (2021-2025),\\n sets 4 key research goals:\\n     1. Identify, review and invest in key research strengths: initiate a robust review\\n          (with international input) of research strengths, and 5-year plans to develop 30-40\\n          such areas; build strategic partnerships with other HEIs, nationally and\\n          internationally, around these strengths.\\n     2. Reduce barriers to interdisciplinary working: establish the Interdisciplinary\\n          Data Sciences Institute; joint supervision of PhDs across disciplines; digital\\n          networking of researchers across UoB.\\n     3. Embed impact in our research: review our assets – facilities, expertise, support\\n          teams – to maximise benefit; develop a culture of enterprise and innovation\\n          supported by an ‘ideas factory’; maximise public engagement opportunities of our\\n          city-centre hub, ‘The Exchange’ (4.2.2).\\n     4. Continue to enhance our research culture and address EDI issues: develop\\n          new academic-staff-development programmes; new research-integrity strategy;\\n          new university-wide academy to support ECRs.\\n                                                                                        Page 5\\n\\n\\n We will ensure professional support and infrastructure underpin these priorities, with\\n emphasis on co-ordination across professional services.\\n 3. People\\n 3.1 Strategy\\n We aspire to be a destination of choice for the best researchers – from postgraduates to\\n professors. People and Culture is a theme in our new Strategic Framework, and places\\n value on those who are at the heart of what we do. Our ambition is to continue developing\\n a vibrant research culture that stimulates and nurtures, is inclusive, equal and diverse,\\n and recognises the importance of staff development from recruitment and induction\\n through to support, progression and retention.\\n 3.2 Postgraduate researchers\\n With nearly 4,000 postgraduate researchers (PGR) (30% international), including 440\\n visiting students, we focus on creating a supportive infrastructure and a high-quality\\n student experience. The Postgraduate Dean (position established 2018) develops\\n strategy and leads enhancements of the offering for all postgraduate students, supported\\n by a Director of Postgraduate Research. UoB commits to welcoming all postgraduates\\n into our vibrant and supportive research culture through our Postgraduate Guarantee. The\\n Westmere Hub, run by the University Graduate School (UGS), opened in 2015, providing\\n a training and social space for all PGR students. The Hub hosts training to support PGRs’\\n development across the Researcher Development Framework (e.g., academic skills,\\n entrepreneurship, career management), whilst high-profile annual events disseminate\\n PGR research widely within the University (Research Poster Conference, Images of\\n Research, Three Minute Thesis). A cross-institutional community is facilitated by the PGR-\\n led activities fund, and five PGRs are appointed as Westmere Scholars to support peer-\\n led community building and researcher-development activities within the Hub, with key\\n themes including wellbeing and inclusivity.\\n The UGS manages the PGR Annual Review process and leads quality assurance projects\\n to understand the PGR experience and tackle any issues. This includes face-to-face\\n training for new PGR supervisors (and those new to the University) and conducting\\n surveys (e.g., Postgraduate Research Experience Survey, PGR Exit survey) to collect\\n initial destinations data and details of PGR alumni to facilitate future career\\n talks/mentoring.\\n Annually, we spend approximately £10m on PhD scholarships distributed by the Colleges,\\n and have offered 10-15 Global Challenges PhD scholarships annually since 2016 with\\n cross-College supervision.\\n 3.3 Early Career Researchers (ECRs)\\n The University is committed to enhancing the development and careers of ECRs. A\\n major route to achieving this is the Postdoctoral / Early-Researcher Career\\n Development and Training (PERCAT) scheme for STEM Colleges and the Early\\n Career and Research Staff Committee (ECARS) for non-STEM Colleges. With senior\\n academic and ECR representation from Colleges, these tailor personal and career\\n development to disciplinary needs. Regular activities developed by ECRs include\\n seminars, training, research-funding and Fellowships workshops. We aim to foster a\\n collective identity for ECRs, ensuring the postdoctoral voice is represented in\\n formulating College strategy. These groups, in turn, feed into the University-level\\n Researcher Development Steering Group, comprising senior academic and ECR\\n representation from all Colleges and reporting directly to Research Committee.\\n                                                                                       Page 6\\n\\n\\n Our European HR Excellence in Research Award was renewed in 2016 and 2020,\\n recognising the work we do to support ECRs. We have conducted a gap analysis\\n against the principles of the New Concordat leading to an action plan that also\\n underpins our HR Excellence in Research actions. The ECR work-stream of the\\n Birmingham Academic Career Framework project has embraced the Concordat principles\\n and is recommending their adoption through a guidance code for research leaders. The\\n Careers in Research Online Survey (CROS) and the PIs and Research Leaders\\n Survey (PIRLS) are conducted biennially and an ensuing action plan is agreed. In 2019\\n we received positive (higher than national) responses, for ECRs feeling valued in\\n publications, funding applications, and public engagement. The University supports the\\n National Postdoc Appreciation Week.\\n 3.4 Academic Staff (Teaching and Research)\\n 3.4.1 Recruitment strategy\\n The University has expanded REF-submitted staff FTE, from 1,141 (REF 2014) to 1,560\\n (REF 2021), via a sustained academic staff recruitment drive - at junior levels to grow\\n careers, and senior levels to provide research leadership. Research-only staff numbers\\n have also grown from 899 to 1,114 in the period, with staff originating from 78 countries.\\n This recruitment, including the fellowship schemes given in Table 2, has selectively\\n enhanced research strengths and critical mass in areas including Corpus Linguistics,\\n Biomedical Imaging and Mathematical Biology.\\n                                Table 2: Fellowship schemes\\n       Scheme         Number recruited in REF                      Description\\n                              Period\\n     Birmingham                 90                \\uf0b7   attracts early-career independent\\n       Fellows                                        researchers to conduct original high-\\n                                                      quality research\\n                                                  \\uf0b7   five years protected research time\\n                                                  \\uf0b7   Fellows graduate to Lecturer/Senior\\n                                                      Lecturer at the end\\n  BRIDGE Fellows                 5                \\uf0b7   novel variation of Birmingham Fellows\\n                                                      scheme including provision to spend one\\n                                                      year at University of Illinois developing\\n                                                      research collaborations\\n     Professorial               23                \\uf0b7   targeted at mid-career academics on a\\n      Research                                        steep upward research trajectory\\n     Fellowships                                  \\uf0b7   three years protected research time\\n       Industry                  2                \\uf0b7   targeted at individuals in industry or\\n     Professorial                                     working      at    the    industry-university\\n       Fellows                                        interface\\n                                                  \\uf0b7   supports transition to academic sector to\\n                                                      drive      industry-university      research\\n                                                      collaborations\\n   Interdisciplinary             4                \\uf0b7   targeted at individuals in established\\n      Professors                                      Chair positions\\n                                                  \\uf0b7   expected to lead and develop significant\\n                                                      interdisciplinary research spanning two or\\n                                                      more Schools, e.g., Computer Science\\n                                                      and Law\\n                                                                                            Page 7\\n\\n\\n 3.4.2 Staff Inductions\\n Central Inductions for new staff provide an overview of the University’s priorities and\\n academic environment, and are delivered simultaneously to academic and professional\\n services staff to encourage collaboration. Mandatory online training for new starters\\n includes Equality and Diversity and Health and Safety.\\n 3.4.3 PDRs and Study Leave\\n New academic staff have a probationary personal development planning (PPDP) period,\\n and are allocated a PPDP mentor to help develop their initial academic objectives with\\n their Head of School. Performance and Development Reviews (PDRs) are conducted\\n annually and managed locally by Colleges and Schools. The University’s HR Excellence\\n Award action plan shows our commitment to a consistent approach to PDRs, recognising\\n their centrality to career development, particularly for those from less represented\\n backgrounds. Academic staff are entitled to apply for study leave (up to 1 semester per 7,\\n with an enhanced scheme in CAL), an opportunity to develop research activities and for\\n personal development.\\n 3.4.4 Training and Development\\n A suite of leadership training courses is tailored to all academic career stages. This\\n includes teaching ECRs to understand core leadership and management skills, and a\\n Senior Leaders Programme for staff taking up greater formal leadership and managerial\\n roles (e.g., College Director of Research), incorporating sessions on ED&I and ‘leading in\\n a diverse context’. The Research Leaders Programme, introduced 2016, offers mid-career\\n academic staff training and support to lead large research programmes with multi-\\n disciplinary collaborations (90 academic attendees to date).\\n The Aurora Leadership Programme, completed by 100 early-career female academics\\n and new senior leaders, aims to develop skills and confidence to negotiate careers and\\n build networks. The Aditi Leadership Programme for BAME academic and academic-\\n related staff, completed by 58 colleagues, helps identify and address the barriers\\n colleagues may face.\\n Our University-wide ‘Developing as a Researcher’ courses for all career stages include\\n career planning, encouraging research integrity, grant writing sessions hosted by external\\n academics and Journal Article writing. Our ‘Influential Researcher’ workshops focus on\\n reaching audience and raising research profile, including sessions on collaboration and\\n wellbeing.\\n 3.4.5 Staff Support\\n The wellbeing of staff is central to creating an inclusive, thriving research environment.\\n The Workplace Wellbeing team provides an Employee Advice and Listening Service to\\n support staff in making informed decisions about work and personal issues, an Employee\\n Disability Service offering practical guidance for disabled staff, and an Occupational\\n Health Service to advise staff about how health (e.g., return to work after sickness) may\\n affect work. Cross-University teams collaborate annually to provide a week of wellbeing-\\n related activities, such as ‘The Happiness Workshop’, for academics. Additionally, we host\\n a staff-wellbeing conference with Nottingham University; in 2019, over 30 HR practitioners\\n and researchers from across the Midlands looked at how wellbeing initiatives work.\\n In 2016, we created a DPVC (ED&I) role to provide leadership and drive progress on ED&I\\n issues, and a network of College Equality Leads to support and embed change using\\n local, subject-specific approaches. The central Equality Team oversees implementation\\n                                                                                      Page 8\\n\\n\\n of ED&I strategy and inter alia provides ED&I information to support research funding bids,\\n including participation of University academics in equality events. An important\\n contribution is to support academic staff (particularly women) to use techniques to combat\\n ‘trolling’.\\n Supported by an EPSRC \"Inclusion Matters\" award, we are conducting rigorous research\\n into bias in making judgements of academic quality, and evaluating the effectiveness of\\n trial interventions, such as ‘reverse mentoring’. Our staff networks are increasingly\\n recognised as models of sector best practice, and include thriving LGBTQ+, BAME,\\n Enabling, Women’s, and Parents’ and Carers’ networks, to ensure staff from under-\\n represented groups are supported and visible. They work together to host ‘Branching Out’\\n events across campus, recognising intersectionality in the ED&I agenda.\\n Our successful 2019 Athena Swan Bronze-level award application demonstrated that our\\n focus on developing female colleagues – through the introduction of institutional targets\\n and recent promotions and recruitment activities - has significantly improved the\\n proportion of senior female staff:\\n                       Table 3: percentage senior female academic staff\\n                          2014                 2020                  Target\\n   Professors             20                   28                    30\\n   Grade 9                27                   34                    30\\n The University received a bronze-level award under the Race Equality Charter (REC)\\n scheme in 2020. Analysis of staff data indicates issues in the recruitment and progression\\n of some groups of BAME academic and Professional Services staff. A key initiative is\\n delivering ‘Talking Confidently About Race’ workshops to all senior management teams,\\n focussing on identifying and addressing bias, micro-aggressions, institutional racism and\\n white privilege. We have also introduced institutional targets for BAME staff representation\\n at each grade.\\n We engage with the Stonewall Workplace Index, aiming to enter the Top 100 Employers’\\n Index as a demonstrable sign of commitment to LGBTQ+ issues. We launched an\\n LGBTQ+ Allies Scheme, open to all staff. In 2020, UoB hosted the LGBTQ+ STEMinar,\\n an annual UK research conference celebrating the work of STEM researchers who identify\\n as LGBTQ+.\\n All staff can request a flexible working pattern. Academic staff on research and teaching\\n contracts returning from maternity, adoption or Shared Parental Leave are entitled to one\\n term’s respite from teaching or administration duties to enable them to focus on research.\\n 3.4.6 Promotions, Reward & Recognition\\n A focus in the REF period has been on embedding reward and recognition of Research\\n Impact in processes at every career stage, including recruitment, PDR, and as a prioritised\\n criterion in promotion. We have committed to valuing and rewarding impact in its broadest\\n sense, appointing or promoting a number of Chairs in direct recognition of their excellence\\n in Impact.\\n 4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n 4.1 Research Awards\\n Our strategic goal is to increase research awards and income by 10% per annum from\\n 2016 to 2026 to enhance the volume, quality and impact of our research.

Central teams provide\\n support for EU/International funding, engagement with industry/charity funders, grant set-\\n up and post-award support. Our Business Engagement team, increased from 9 to 21 FTE\\n since 2014, develops strategic academic-industry partnerships and has helped to\\n increase industry research grants by over 200% between 2014 and 2020. Our Research\\n Planning Team provides institutional support and guidance and training in Impact and\\n REF, Open Access and Research information.\\n We support PIs to develop applications for multimillion-pound complex research and\\n innovation projects (e.g., RPIF, ISCF, ESIF) through the Strategic Research Development\\n team, typically co-ordinating a range of external partners/stakeholders and internal\\n academic and professional services teams across the University. The Development and\\n Alumni Relations Office encourages philanthropic support for research projects, including\\n from Trusts and Foundations; the Birmingham in Action campaign, launched 2019, set\\n stretching targets for philanthropic research awards to help tackle global challenges, such\\n as youth mental health.\\n University of Birmingham Enterprise supports academics to take ideas to market, creating\\n new businesses and social enterprises, providing enterprise training, access to\\n investment, office and laboratory space and a full ‘Knowledge Exchange’ service. In\\n 2019-20, 63% of researchers used these services.\\n Our research communications team has recently prioritised examples of research impact:\\n 53 impact cases were supported with communications and policy activity across the\\n Colleges and 41 through high-profile Heroes and Quest campaigns. These campaigns\\n feature diverse academics in terms of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and career\\n stage, creating visible role models.\\n 4.2 Major Capital Investment\\n In this REF period, we have invested substantial capital and leveraged external\\n investment, in physical assets that provide a world-class environment for research and\\n extend the breadth and depth of knowledge exchange and impact.\\n 4.2.1 Core research facilities\\n Investments in the core research and education environment since 2014 include the\\n £25.9m Business School Extension (opened 2019), a £83.7m new building for\\n Engineering (2021), £ 16.3m refurbishment for Law/Music, £22.6m investment in the\\n                                                                                     Page 10\\n\\n\\n School of Psychology, new £80m Molecular Sciences building (2023) as a principal\\n research space for Chemistry and Environmental Sciences, and a £59.2m new Main\\n Library (2016).\\n 4.2.2 Knowledge Exchange investments\\n To enhance the University’s external engagement, knowledge exchange and impact\\n strategy we have invested in:\\n                            Table 5: Knowledge Exchange Investments\\n       Building          Investment (£)                            Purpose\\n  The      Exchange          40.2m           \\uf0b7   hub to bring local partners and community\\n  (Opening 2021)                                 together to shape and transform the region,\\n                                                 deliver public engagement programmes\\n                                             \\uf0b7   housing the new RED-funded regional economic\\n                                                 development institute, WM-REDI.\\n  Edgbaston      Park        40.9m           \\uf0b7   hosts research conferences, and knowledge\\n  Hotel           and                            exchange activities e.g., the 2019 Quantum\\n  Conference Centre                              Technologies Hub Phase 2 launch, involving\\n                                                 national and international academics and\\n                                                 companies\\n  University        of   22.6m (20m from     \\uf0b7   the only UK-university-owned comprehensive\\n  Birmingham           DoE)                      school;

We are\\n         committed to pioneering research and impact that has local, regional, national and global\\n         reach and significance across a true universality of fields.\\n 1.1.2   Established in 1964 by Royal Charter, we are one of only 6 UK collegiate universities.\\n         Our main campus, situated within 300 acres of parkland south of the city of Lancaster, is\\n         home to a vibrant, diverse and inclusive community of staff and students (figure 1.1).\\n 1.1.3   Our uniqueness is exemplified by: the Centre for Global Eco-innovation; the Centre for\\n         Research and Evidence on Security Threats - combining behavioural and technological\\n         perspectives; the Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science; the Health Innovation\\n         Campus; IsoLab – our advanced environment for studying quantum systems; The Ruskin\\n         - the largest collection of Ruskin’s works; the Work Foundation – the leading think-tank\\n         for improving work in the UK; the first British university campus in sub-Saharan Africa\\n         (Ghana) and as partners in two Chinese Academy of Science institutes: Guangzhou\\n         Institute of Geochemistry and the Institute of Urban Environment.\\n 1.1.4   Our ‘Strategy for 2020’ has three equally important priorities:\\n         \\uf0b7      Research that changes practice and thinking\\n         \\uf0b7      Teaching that transforms people’s lives and society\\n         \\uf0b7      Engagement with students, businesses and our communities.\\n 1.1.5   To deliver our strategy we have grown staff and student numbers (figure 1.1), research\\n         and engagement income, research impact, and invested in our estate to secure world-\\n         class research facilities (see sections 2 and 4).\\n 1.1.6   As a Civic University signatory, our priorities align with those of our local partners and we\\n         support the rural and relatively disadvantaged communities and economies across the\\n         north-west of England. We bolster this through membership of the N8 Research\\n         Partnership, cementing our reach and scale to deliver benefits to the economy and\\n         communities of the North and beyond.\\n 1.1.7   We were Times ‘University of the Year 2018’ and Sunday Times ‘International University\\n         of the Year 2020’. We have ranked in the top-10 of the three main UK league tables\\n         since 2016 and our QS University Ranking has increased from 156th (2014) to 136th\\n         (2021). We were awarded a Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Engineering and Technology\\n         for ‘Furthering Understanding in Language’ (2015) and since REF2014 seven of our staff\\n         have been recognised in the Queen’s honours lists (for example Professor Louise\\n         Heathwaite was awarded a CBE in 2018).\\n                                                                                                  Page 1\\n\\n\\n Figure 1.1 Lancaster University staff/student profile for 2013/14 and 2019/20 (headcount)\\n 1.2.    Structure\\n 1.2.1   Lancaster has four faculties:\\n         \\uf0b7     Arts and Social Sciences – comprising >20 disciplines across 9 departments and\\n               home to Lancaster Arts, providing professional arts, public performances and\\n               exhibitions. In REF2014, over 80% of research activity was rated as world-leading\\n               and internationally excellent.\\n         \\uf0b7     Health and Medicine – spanning clinical, applied health, biomedical, medical and\\n               social science disciplines addressing prominent 21st-century challenges including\\n               ageing, mental health, epidemiology, social and economic inequality. In REF2014\\n               the Faculty ranked equal first with 100% 4* 'research environment' and third for\\n               intensity weighted GPA with 99% of eligible staff returned.\\n         \\uf0b7     Lancaster University Management School – comprising 6 departments and the\\n               Work Foundation, ranked the top UK business school for 'research power' in\\n               REF2014. The School carries quadruple accreditation by the leading international\\n               business school accrediting bodies.\\n         \\uf0b7     Science and Technology – research across chemistry, computing and\\n               communication, engineering, environment, mathematics and statistics, physics and\\n               psychology. In REF2014, over 80% of research activity was rated as world-leading\\n               and internationally excellent.\\n 1.2.2   We have four cross-faculty Research Institutes (Data Science, Materials Science,\\n         Security and Social Futures) addressing grand challenges facing society through\\n         interdisciplinary research (2.1.3).\\n 1.2.3   We have invested in senior leadership of research and impact through new roles and\\n         appointments during the period. This includes two Pro-Vice-Chancellors, for Research\\n         and Enterprise and for Engagement (new in 2018) and two Cross-Faculty Associate\\n         Deans covering Research, and Enterprise and Engagement (new in 2018 and 2020).\\n 2. Strategy\\n 2.1.    Research\\n 2.1.1. Delivery of our strategy to ‘undertake research of the very highest quality by international\\n         standards, as recognised by our peers and by users and adopters’ is evidenced by the\\n         following outcomes:\\n             \\uf0b7 Increased research outputs and field weighted citation impact (table 2.1);\\n             \\uf0b7 More international partnerships, extending our reach and significance (table 2.1);\\n                                                                                              Page 2\\n\\n\\n             \\uf0b7 Significant research income growth (figure 4.1);\\n             \\uf0b7 Growth in grant applications and awards (figure 4.3).\\n 2.1.2. These outcomes have been enabled by:\\n             \\uf0b7 New structures to facilitate interdisciplinary research (2.1.3);\\n             \\uf0b7 Work with external stakeholders to maximise research impact (Error! Reference\\n                source not found.2.2);\\n             \\uf0b7 Supporting our research students and researchers, especially during early career\\n                stages (3.2);\\n             \\uf0b7 Investment in research infrastructure and facilities (section 4).\\n                                            REF2014       REF2021\\n  Scholarly output                              10,967         17,879\\n  With international collaboration               4,964         10,141\\n  Field weighted citation impact                   2.00          2.11\\n  With international collaboration                 2.44          2.56\\n Table 2.1 Research performance (SciVal)\\n 2.1.3. Our interdisciplinary research organisation drives major, cross-cutting initiatives targeting\\n         complex global challenges outside traditional faculty structures. Researchers are\\n         encouraged to contribute to our flagship Research Institutes and Institutional Research\\n         Centres (Ageing; Energy; Global Eco-innovation; Ruskin Library, Museum and Research\\n         Centre (The Ruskin); Mobility; and the Pentland Centre for Sustainability in Business).\\n 2.1.4. Senior academic experts, recruited internally, internationally and from industry, lead our\\n         Research Institutes to drive large-scale interdisciplinary initiatives, such as the £3M\\n         EPSRC project Future Places possible only due to collaboration between Social Futures\\n         and Data Science. Following investment of £2.6M since REF2014 the Institutes have\\n         acquired significant funding (£39.6M) and produced high-quality interdisciplinary\\n         research with impact via 3,782 outputs with 59,422 citations (SciVal).\\n 2.1.5. Our Research Centres target external engagement opportunities in areas of research\\n         excellence to leverage funding and impact, evidenced through £33M European Structural\\n         Investment Fund (ESIF) projects for eco-innovation; criticalities around museums of the\\n         future and cultural leadership via The Ruskin; and informing sustainability dialogues at\\n         the World Economic Forum.\\n 2.1.6. We devolve mainstream QR to faculties and departments to invest in staff (figure 1.1),\\n         infrastructure and facilities (section 4) and discipline-specific research that engages with\\n         regional and national research priorities. Key projects underpinned by QR since\\n         REF2014 include:\\n             \\uf0b7 £11.8M ESRC Centre for Research and Evidence on Security Threats: UK hub for\\n                behavioural and social science research led by Lancaster;\\n             \\uf0b7 £3.8M ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science: cutting-edge\\n                methods in the study of language;\\n             \\uf0b7 £2.5M NIHR Applied Research Collaboration North West Coast: multi-partner\\n                research in health inequalities and barriers, translating discoveries into practice;\\n             \\uf0b7 £2.3M EPSRC OR-MASTER: Mathematical models and algorithms for allocating\\n                scarce airport resources.\\n 2.1.7. We invest QR to enable institutional strategic growth, for example in our Research\\n         Institutes (2.1.3) and Doctoral Academy (3.4). QR enabled the recruitment and bespoke\\n         mentoring of future research leaders through our 50th anniversary lectureship scheme.\\n         Their successes since 2014 include 29 internal promotions, including three fast-tracked\\n         to Professor, >£8M in awarded grants, and 843 scholarly outputs with >13,000 citations\\n         (SciVal).\\n                                                                                                  Page 3\\n\\n\\n 2.1.8. Additional institutional QR awards have further supported relevant grants and enabled\\n         new research initiatives that support the development of outcomes, impact and our staff.\\n         It has allowed us to forge new partnerships and collaborations with overseas\\n         organisations and local, regional, national and international policymakers. For example,\\n         facilitating the £7M Recirculate project which supports new partnership-based\\n         approaches to enable African researchers to grow transformational impact with, in and\\n         for their communities.\\n 2.1.9   The principles and practices of open research at Lancaster University exemplify core\\n         values embedded within Lancaster’s moto, patet omnibus veritas (truth lies open to all),\\n         underpinned by our membership of the UK Reproducibility Network. As a signatory to the\\n         San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment we advocate responsible use of\\n         metrics. Due to our commitment in this area, our UKRI open access compliancy has\\n         improved from 55% in 2013/14 to 93% in 2019/20.\\n 2.1.10 Commitment to the Concordat to Support Research Integrity, the Concordat on Openness\\n         in Animal Research, and our commitment to enhance equality, diversity and inclusion\\n         (3.3) drives Lancaster’s culture of research integrity. Annual research integrity reports\\n         since 2013-14 are publically available. Staff training and ethical review ensures our\\n         research respects the dignity, rights and welfare of participants and that minimises risks\\n         to participants, researchers and third parties.\\n 2.2.    Impact and engagement\\n 2.2.1   Achievement of our strategy to apply ‘our collective intellectual and wider capabilities for\\n         economic and societal benefit across regional, national and international dimensions’\\n         was enabled through investment in support structures and facilities (section 4) and\\n         changes to our academic promotion and awards criteria (3.1.3). Successes include:\\n             \\uf0b7 Increased partnerships with communities, businesses, government departments\\n                 and other agents of social and economic change and development, working with\\n                 >620 research partners;\\n             \\uf0b7 Growth in relevant funding (table 2.2);\\n             \\uf0b7 External recognition, such as being named the leading HEI nationally for economic\\n                 development in the 2016 Higher Education Business and Community Interaction\\n                 survey.\\n                                                                    REF2014            REF2021\\n      Industry research grant income                            £12,002,983         £27,125,801\\n      Higher Education Innovation Funding (HEIF)                 £9,328,667         £21,375,199\\n      Impact Acceleration Account (IAA) funding                     £600,000          £3,613,000\\n      Knowledge Transfer Partnerships                          9 at £966,763    12 at £2,385,056\\n Table 2.2 Growth in impact-enabling awards\\n 2.2.2   As a signatory to the Concordat for Engaging the Public with Research and the Manifesto\\n         for Public Engagement, we use HEIF and other external funding (including £83M ESIF\\n         during the period) to drive research-led engagement and impact. A 2019 independent\\n         impact assessment found £28 of economic benefits were realised per £1 of public\\n         funding received by Lancaster.\\n 2.2.3   We stimulate research that is responsive and relevant to societal challenges and industry\\n         needs, with an emphasis on co-design, co-production and co-delivery. Exemplars\\n         include:\\n             \\uf0b7 £5M EPSRC Prosperity Partnership with BT focused on developing and delivering\\n                 the future digital infrastructure for the UK;\\n                                                                                                Page 4\\n\\n\\n             \\uf0b7 £33M ESIF eco-innovation projects enabling the development of new products and\\n                 services with environmental benefits through 41 PhD and 69 MRes projects\\n                 designed with small and medium-sized businesses.\\n 2.2.4   IAA funding has supported researchers to further impact through competitive internal\\n         awards and enabled work with >250 external partners. The last report submitted to the\\n         EPSRC (2017-2020 IAA award) showed 47 of 51 projects funded are continuing post-IAA\\n         and leveraging >£8.5M further income, translating to a return of >£10 for every £1 of\\n         EPSRC IAA funding. Impacts produced from IAA funding included a significant\\n         collaboration with the UK Environment Agency to raise flood awareness and resilience in\\n         adults and young people by increasing the reach of digital resources developed from our\\n         research data. The work is directly referenced in the 2019 Defra National Flood and\\n         Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy.\\n 2.2.5   We have built external relationships, generated new research opportunities and\\n         encouraged academic engagement by introducing new intellectual property and\\n         consultancy policies that offer generous revenue sharing arrangements for all parties.\\n         Starting from a low base, we have seen consultancy increase thirty-fold since the new\\n         policy launched in 2019.\\n 2.2.6   Our regional context is an important element of our research environment. We were an\\n         early signatory to the Civic University Agreement and we work closely with regional Local\\n         Enterprise Partnerships, FE Colleges, local authorities, NHS trusts and community and\\n         third sector bodies. Lancaster Arts, The Ruskin and our Regional Heritage Centre are\\n         examples of high-quality research activities focused on distinctive, regional contexts with\\n         global significance.\\n 2.2.7   Our staff participate in a wide range of free public and community engagement events,\\n         providing opportunities to learn about, and participate in, research. Activities include\\n         public lectures, festivals, and local and national events such as Campus in the City, Light\\n         up Lancaster, and Sex, Bugs & Rock ‘n’ Roll at Glastonbury.\\n 2.3.    Future strategies\\n 2.3.1   The new university strategy, published April 2021, builds on our previous achievements\\n         and reaffirms the three pillars of research, engagement and teaching at Lancaster.\\n 2.3.2   The continuity of ambition and reassertion of research intensity will be achieved through\\n         supporting and growing interdisciplinary research; increasing and diversifying research\\n         income; and improving the quality and reach of our research and impact to achieve\\n         ‘research that changes practice and thinking’.\\n 2.3.3   We will continue the ongoing development of impactful interfaces between research,\\n         enterprise and engagement. In part, this will be realised through the continuation of\\n         leadership in prominent, collaborative, interdisciplinary research that addresses societal\\n         challenges at regional, national and global levels. This includes our involvement in the\\n         flagship Eden Project North that will bring significant and transformative impact to our\\n         local area.\\n 2.3.4   Initial activities on our campuses in Beijing Jiatong University (China), Lancaster\\n         University Ghana, Sunway University (Malaysia) and Lancaster University Leipzig\\n         (Germany) have focused on teaching, and future strategies will focus on developing\\n         research agendas with these partners.\\n 3. People\\n 3.1.    Strategic development\\n 3.1.1   We have achieved the aims of our People Strategy to:\\n                                                                                                 Page 5\\n\\n\\n             \\uf0b7 Attract and recruit the best staff nationally and internationally (3.1.2);\\n             \\uf0b7 Develop and support staff to fulfil their potential and meet their career aspirations\\n                (3.2);\\n             \\uf0b7 Retain and reward our staff through recognising their contributions (3.1.2, 3.1.3);\\n             \\uf0b7 Promote and secure excellence in leadership and management (3.2.3);\\n             \\uf0b7 Create and maintain a progressive, collaborative and healthy working environment\\n                (section 3).\\n 3.1.2   An institutional annual review of planning and resources provides opportunity to make\\n         adjustments that reflect new areas of growth through high calibre staff appointments or\\n         strategic investments. This has resulted in 45% growth in our research staff (figure 1.1)\\n         since REF2014. On average ‘Teaching and Research’ Staff are allocated 30% workload\\n         for research. Our commitment to reducing the use of fixed-term contracts wherever\\n         possible, has had a significant effect since this policy was introduced in 2019 (fig. 3.1).\\n         Our redeployment policy enables us, where possible, to retain the talent, skills and\\n         experience of our employees when an individual’s post is due to end.\\n Figure 3.1 Fixed term contracts: Headcount of all research staff by gender\\n 3.1.3   We reward excellence in research, teaching, academic leadership and engagement\\n         through academic promotion recognising differing degrees of emphasis across these\\n         criteria at different career levels and stages. Recognising disciplinary differences,\\n         evidence of advancement in research comprises the reach and significance of outputs\\n         and impacts, including demonstrating very considerable research impacts; research\\n         income; management and leadership; mentoring; international recognition; and\\n         interdisciplinary work. While female staff are over-represented in promotion applications\\n         (average 39.8% of applications over last 6 years compared to 36.4% of the eligible pool)\\n         and more likely than men to be successful in their application (42.5% of successful\\n         cases), there is ongoing work to ensure continued female success to address the\\n         underlying gender inequality in our academic staff population (figures 3.2 and 3.3a).\\n                                                                                                 Page 6\\n\\n\\n  400\\n  300\\n  200                                                            222\\n                                          118\\n                    98\\n  100\\n                    74                     86                     97\\n      0\\n                 Grade 8               Grade 9               Professor\\n                                   Female     Male\\n Figure 3.2 Promotion by gender since REF2014\\n 3.1.4   Our annual institutional and faculty-level staff awards for excellence and for embodying\\n         Lancaster’s values celebrate outstanding contributions. Since 2019 there has been a\\n         dedicated Research Impact award, to reward the most innovative of our researchers. It\\n         can be awarded to an individual or a team, and combines a monetary award with public\\n         recognition at our annual graduation ceremonies.\\n 3.1.5   Our suite of people-related policies and procedures includes a policy for sabbatical leave\\n         designed to advance the pursuit of scholarship, research and the development of our\\n         staff that has resulted in 304 paid sabbaticals since 2016/17. Our bullying, harassment\\n         and sexual misconduct and safeguarding policies protect and support both our staff and\\n         collaborators. Lancaster supports flexible working and has both local informal approvals\\n         to assist colleagues manage the varying responsibilities of work and home life, and a\\n         more formal mechanism for staff to request temporary or permanent adjustments (38\\n         approved since records began in 2017).\\n 3.1.6   Regular staff surveys are used to inform areas for strategic improvements, such as newly\\n         constituted working-groups focused on work-life balance and supporting technical staff.\\n         Our staff intranet, launched in 2015, continues to improve internal communication (news\\n         homepage visited on average 18,700 times per week).\\n 3.1.7   Lancaster provides access to a range of professional support tools through an Employee\\n         Assistance Programme and has adopted the Five Ways to Wellbeing framework to help\\n         improve the health and wellbeing of our staff. A dedicated staff wellbeing website\\n         provides a central point of wellbeing resources. We provide an Access to Work Mental\\n         Health Support Service for people working and living with mental health difficulties and\\n         their employers and have mandatory mental health awareness training for all staff. Staff\\n         surveys consistently show that more than 80% of staff feel their wellbeing is valued by\\n         the University.\\n 3.2.    Staff development\\n 3.2.1   Our commitment to the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers\\n         empowers continual improvement to equal opportunities for research staff to contribute\\n         (3.2.2), develop (3.2.3) and progress (3.1.3), particularly those on fixed term contracts.\\n 3.2.2   Our Concordat Implementation Group, recognised through the European HR Excellence\\n         in Research award (awarded 2011, renewed successfully at the 8th year review in 2019)\\n         and underpinned by a code of practice, sets out the roles and responsibilities of Principal\\n         Investigators (PI), research staff and the University. We ensure opportunities for\\n         representation throughout our university committee structure.\\n 3.2.3   A full range of support and development programmes are available to our researchers\\n         underpinned by an annual personal development review and the opportunity for\\n         mentoring or coaching. All staff are actively encouraged to develop, starting with\\n                                                                                                Page 7\\n\\n\\n         ‘Introduction to Research at Lancaster’, which provides key information and advice on\\n         processes and procedures. Other programmes include PI development programmes,\\n         ‘Making Professor’ events, writing retreats and Lancaster’s flagship ‘Bonington\\n         Leadership Programme’ (48% female) for high-performing staff looking to take the next\\n         steps towards senior leadership.\\n 3.2.4   Career skills development for ECRs is delivered through bespoke training; signposting to\\n         external organisations; career mentoring and coaching; ECR representation on university\\n         committees; reduced teaching loads during probation; and support of the Research Staff\\n         Association that supports the career development of contract researchers. Together with\\n         Liverpool and Manchester Universities, we are a founding partner in Prosper, a £4.4M\\n         collaborative Research England Development project investigating alternative career\\n         pathways and development opportunities for post-doctoral researchers with a range of\\n         stakeholders including Unilever PLC, IBM and local enterprise partnerships.\\n 3.3.    Equality, diversity and inclusion\\n 3.3.1   Significant resource is deployed to analyse and refine our EDI policies and practices,\\n         with focal points on improved data and enhancing the staff voice. We are a partner on\\n         the EPSRC project Northern Power Inclusion Matters shaping a community that\\n         supports, drives and sustains greater equality for all, including traditionally under-\\n         represented groups.\\n         We regularly review and analyse our EDI data (figures 3.3a-c, 3.5) using staff groups to\\n         explore key issues, have grown the EDI team, added EDI to the PVC portfolio, and have\\n         established a new University Dean for EDI. We have an institutional EDI Committee and\\n         EDI Action Group and mandatory EDI staff training requiring renewal every three years.\\n  Figure 3.3a Gender comparison between REF2014 and REF2021\\n                                                                                                Page 8\\n\\n\\n Figure 3.3b Disability comparison between REF2014 and REF2021\\n Figure 3.3c Age comparison between REF2014 and REF2021\\n 3.3.2   To tackle gender inequalities, including in promotion (figure 3.1), recruitment (figure 3.4)\\n         and to address our gender pay gap, we established an Athena SWAN Institutional Self-\\n         Assessment Team and a Gender Pay Gap Task Group. These groups published\\n         institutional action plans to drive inclusive practices including, a new recruitment toolkit\\n         designed to reduce bias; expansion of committee representation; revised progression\\n         route framework; and targets to increase the percentage of female staff applicants for\\n         jobs and promotion. As a result, our institutional Athena SWAN bronze award, held since\\n         2008, was renewed in 2020 and we have seen a reduction in our mean hourly gender\\n         pay gap from 27.7% in 2017 to 25.89% in 2020.\\n                                                                                                 Page 9\\n\\n\\n      3.3.1\\n       Figure 3.4 Recruitment of researchers by age profile and gender\\n       3.3.3   We are members of the Disability Confident Scheme and the Stonewall Global Diversity\\n               Champions programme and display these affiliations on job adverts to attract the most\\n               talented and diverse candidate pools. Despite a lack of diversity in the local area,\\n               Lancaster’s number of BAME staff is above national average (15.7% against 14.5%\\n               HESA 2018-19) however, BAME UK nationals are lower (7.5% against 10.1% HESA\\n               2018-29). We will join the Race Equality Charter in April 2021 and our Strategic Race\\n               Advisory Group will lead an action plan to oversee an increase in BAME staff numbers,\\n               applications for roles and promotions.\\n       Figure 3.5 Ethnicity comparison between REF2014 and REF2021\\n       3.3.4   We operate a devolved EDI culture where departments are encouraged to be creative\\n               and adaptive when implementing policy and solutions suitable for their disciplines (see\\n               unit statements). We encourage departments to seek recognition for their own\\n               commitments to advancing equality and half hold an Athena SWAN award (11 bronze, 2\\n               silver). Our silver Athena SWAN award holders serve as peer mentors for others\\n               applying for their first awards.\\n       3.3.5   Our approach builds strong commitment and engagement and enables the institution to\\n               listen to the staff voice and has led to several initiatives derived from across our\\n                                                                                                    Page 10\\n\\n\\n         community. These have spread more widely, encouraging learning from area-to-area and\\n         supporting the enhancement of an institutional framework. Institutional actions to be\\n         explored include, extending FHM’s career-bridging scheme across Lancaster; extending\\n         the pilot of advertising ‘returner posts’ in STEMM and other under-represented subjects;\\n         and extending FST’s practice of offering academic returners a reduced and managed\\n         workload for the first year.\\n 3.3.6   An Equality Impact Assessment (EIA) was completed for our REF2021 Code of Practice,\\n         refreshed throughout the preparations and following submission. REF-specific EDI\\n         training was provided for all decision-making staff to ensure EDI considerations were\\n         integrated into all aspects of our preparations and through our REF committees.\\n 3.4.    Postgraduate research students (PGRs)\\n 3.4.1   Lancaster has seen significant growth in PGR numbers of 15% since 2013-14 (figure\\n         1.1). They are supported by our institutional Doctoral Academy, faculties, departments,\\n         and colleges. This has seen our graduates progressing to careers in higher education,\\n         public and private sector organisations.\\n 3.4.2   The Doctoral Academy works across the institution to offer high quality training\\n         opportunities and personal support. Each department has an academic Director of\\n         Postgraduate Research studies. They serve on related committees and as\\n         representatives within our Doctoral Academy to share best practice and provide advice\\n         on training opportunities amongst supervisors and administrators to optimise the PGR\\n         experience.\\n 3.4.3   Each PGR is assigned two supervisors and, if desired, an independent mentor. Since\\n         REF2014, we have instigated an online portal to record progress, supervisory meetings\\n         and upload associated documents. These are corroborated by a supervisor and ensure\\n         meetings take place at least every 28 days.\\n 4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n 4.1.    Income\\n 4.1.1   Lancaster has significantly increased research income since REF2014 (figure 4.1).\\n         Sustained growth was achieved by investment in our academic staff (3.2.1), supportive\\n         infrastructure (4.2) and facilities (4.3). Despite continual advancement, achievement of\\n         the strategic target of £45M by 2020 was disrupted due to Covid-19 (fig. 4.1 2019/20).\\n         We have also seen a significant growth in our in-kind income from £19.3M (REF2014) to\\n         £38M (REF2021).\\n                                                                                             Page 11\\n\\n\\n                                 50000\\n                                 45000\\n    Research income, p.a. / £k\\n                                 40000\\n                                 35000\\n                                 30000\\n                                 25000\\n                                 20000\\n                                 15000\\n                                 10000\\n                                  5000\\n                                     0\\n                                         2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 2019/20\\n                                                                   Year\\n Figure 4.1 Research income\\n 4.1.2                            We have seen growth in income across the institution (see unit statements) and\\n                                  maintained a similar funder profile despite the significant increase (figure 4.2).

      "['The University of Manchester\\n  1. Context and mission\\n The University of Manchester (UoM) ranks among leading research universities globally, with a\\n history of world-changing achievements spanning almost 200 years. Our global collaborations\\n include strategic partnerships with leading universities across the world.\\n Our strategic goals are research and discovery, teaching and learning, and social responsibility.\\n Running through our goals is an emphasis on innovation, civic engagement and global influence,\\n all driven by our people and underpinned by our values (Figure 1). Our vision is “to be recognised\\n globally for the excellence of our people, research, learning and innovation, and for the benefits\\n we bring to society and the environment”.\\n                                  Figure 1 – Our Strategic Goals\\n The University employs >11,000 people, including >2,000 REF-eligible academics, nearly 2,000\\n research staff, and >1,000 technical and experimental officers. The majority of academics\\n undertake research and teaching (~84% FTE). UoM has 40,250 students, including over 4,000\\n postgraduate researchers (PGRs). Placed 23rd in the 2020 THE global ranking of the most\\n international universities: 36% of staff and 28% of students are from outside the UK. International\\n research funding accounts for 15% of our research income including over 400 EU Horizon 2020\\n awards in the REF period. Our annual income exceeds £1bn with an average of 26% generated\\n from research over the REF period.\\n Large multidisciplinary Schools and Faculties (Figure 2) and interdisciplinary University Research\\n Institutes, which underpin our Research Beacons (Section 2), enable discipline-specific research\\n excellence and interdisciplinary collaborations. Our REF 2021 submission includes 31 UoAs.\\n                                                                                              Page 1\\n\\n\\n                            Figure 2 – University of Manchester Structure\\n Since our 2004 foundation (merger of The Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST) we have\\n worked closely with industry and other stakeholders to maximise the positive impact of our\\n research in Greater Manchester (GM), nationally and globally. GM is one of the largest and most\\n diverse city regions in the UK, with 2.8 million residents and another 7 million living within an hour’s\\n travel time. Through civic commitment, our research contributes to the delivery of GM’s Local\\n Industrial Strategy’s priorities in health innovation, advanced materials, and building a creative\\n and digital city region committed to clean and inclusive growth and carbon neutral living by 2038\\n (Section 2).\\n 2. Strategy\\n Our strategy is to achieve research excellence and impact across diverse research activities,\\n promoting cross disciplinary research, innovation and international recognition.\\n Unless otherwise stated, growth figures refer to the REF period.\\n Our strategic goals and achievements were:\\n \\uf0b7   To raise our research quality and global standing. In 2020 we ranked 36th in the Academic\\n     Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), (38th in 2014), and 22% of our publications were in the\\n     top decile for citations in their field. We have two Nobel Laureates, two Regius Professors, 123\\n     fellows of National Academies, 32 Fellows of Academia Europaea and 33 Clarivate Highly\\n     Cited Researchers. Two research teams were awarded Queen’s Anniversary Prizes:\\n     Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (2019) and Imaging for Advanced Materials (2013).\\n \\uf0b7   To generate research impact and commercialisation. We were first in the UK in the 2020\\n     THE University Impact Rankings and 8th globally for social and environmental impact and\\n     contribution to the delivery of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n     Commercialisation progress was recognised by a rapid climb in Reuters’ Europe’s Most\\n     Innovative Universities ranking 8th in Europe and 4th in the UK in 2019.\\n                                                                                                   Page 2\\n\\n\\n In 2013, we set five priorities to achieve these goals:\\n i)      People\\n We enhanced career development support and training for all researchers and set high\\n recruitment standards. We invested >£10m in 136 early-career research (ECR) fellows, including\\n flagship Presidential Fellows; another 121 were externally funded, including 14 UKRI Future\\n Leaders. Research fellows increased from 332 to 456, including an expansion of externally funded\\n fellowships to 355 in 2020. We awarded 6,642 research doctoral degrees.\\n ii)     World-class research environment\\n We secured ~ £2bn research income, £389m external capital investment in research infrastructure\\n and >£130m UKRI in-kind income. Our market share of the sector’s research grants and contract\\n income rose from 4% to 7%, placing us 5th in 2018/19 (latest HESA data); our share of UKRI\\n research income rose from 5% to 7%.\\n iii)    Interdisciplinary collaborative research founded on disciplinary pillars\\n We invested ~£147m in new interdisciplinary research to build teams and support success in\\n external funding applications (ii above).\\n Our five research beacons highlight areas of interdisciplinary excellence and scale: advanced\\n materials, cancer, energy, global inequalities and industrial biotechnology. Cross-cutting\\n thematic priorities in Digital, Creative and Environment stimulated new collaborations with\\n external stakeholders. Policy@Manchester draws our research discoveries into thought\\n leadership and policy making forums (see iv).\\n Sixteen of our twenty-three interdisciplinary Research Institutes launched in the REF period,\\n including our lead of the Henry Royce Institute (Royce) national facility (Figure 3). They\\n encompass ~43% of our academic researchers. Twelve institutes combine STEM, social sciences\\n and humanities. Each has a significant external funding portfolio and a large number of Principal\\n Investigators: median 57; >100 in 10 institutes. Together they generated ~66% of our external\\n research income and philanthropic donations.\\n                                                                                            Page 3\\n\\n\\n We host major national and international infrastructure (Section 4). Collaborations include the\\n NHS, graphene innovation ecosystem and membership of national facilities including the Turing\\n Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence and the Rosalind Franklin Institute. Regional\\n collaborations include the N8 Research Partnership, Northern Health Science Alliance and ERDF-\\n funded AI and Cyber-security initiatives with Greater Manchester universities.\\n We established strategic international partnerships with the Universities of Melbourne, Toronto\\n and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Each has a pump-priming fund to initiate collaborations\\n (£275,000 during the REF period). Dual PGR programmes with Melbourne and Toronto are\\n supported by a further £160,000. Our global research collaborations are strengthened through\\n partnerships with Copenhagen University, Peking University Health Sciences Centre, Tsinghua\\n University, KTH/Stockholm University and the Indian Institute of Science. International\\n partnerships in the Global South were supported through UKRI’s Global Challenge Research Fund\\n and the Newton Fund (£42m total).\\n                                                                                               Page 4\\n\\n\\n iv)     Impact: ensuring parity of support and esteem between research discovery,\\n         application and impact, including commercialisation where appropriate\\n Our mission is to deliver economic, social, cultural, health and wellbeing benefits for society and\\n the environment. Our policies and infrastructure enable impact and engagement. Evidence\\n includes our THE University Impact Ranking (see above), and the range and quality of our 160\\n impact case studies (ICS): over 30% report health impact, 23% economic and commercial, 24%\\n policy, ~20% include public engagement or cultural impact, and 94% map to at least one SDG.\\n Impact is rewarded and celebrated. Impact is one of four criteria in academic probation and\\n promotions (alongside research, teaching and academic service), and time is allocated to support\\n impact alongside research activities. Events celebrating impact include our annual Distinguished\\n Achievement Awards and Making a Difference Awards for social responsibility. Specialist\\n professional teams support impact with target research users, including commercialisation (Figure\\n 7), policy makers and influencers through Policy@Manchester, public engagement and the\\n Masood Entrepreneurship Centre for PGR/ECR enterprise start-ups (Section 3).\\n Significant funding supports impact activity. An average £1.9m p.a. is invested through UKRI\\n Impact Acceleration Accounts (IAA) from BBSRC, ESRC, EPSRC and STFC; MRC Proximity to\\n Discovery and Confidence in Concept funds, and Wellcome Trust’s Translational Partnership\\n Award. These schemes lever additional direct and in-kind investment from industry and other\\n partners; for example the EPSRC IAA (£6.4m) and ESRC IAA (£2.8m) over the REF period. Five\\n UKRPIF awards, with significant industry co-investment, enhanced our impact infrastructure.\\n We shape and deliver global, national and regional research priorities.\\n Industry research collaborations generate significant economic contribution. HESA ranks us 4th\\n in the UK for SME engagement and top two over the last two years for the value of industry\\n collaborative research. We rank 5th in the UK for publications with industry, 24th out of 1,000\\n universities globally in the CWTS Leiden Ranking and 2nd for Innovate UK Knowledge Transfer\\n Partnerships (KTPs) - 38 live. Our KTP portfolio increased by >50% (number and value) securing\\n ~ £10.4m government funding and nearly £9m industry contribution (2013-2020). In 2018/19 two-\\n thirds of the new KTPs were with SMEs and 40% were GM-based. Significant growth in our\\n strategic industrial research partnerships include Unilever, Boots and four EPSRC Prosperity\\n Partnership awards with AstraZeneca, BP and other global partners. Major industry partners in\\n our doctoral training centres include the BBC, EDF, Rolls-Royce and GlaxoSmithKline. Over 1,500\\n GM-based SMEs access our advanced research facilities through ERDF and other programmes,\\n attracting international inward investment from high-tech firms.\\n Research commercialisation generated £402m economic impact over five years to July 31st\\n 2020. The 2020 relaunch of our IP commercialisation subsidiary has already doubled the number\\n of annual spin-outs, reinforcing our presence in the top six for invention disclosures from 2014 to\\n 2019 (>1000 in period 2015-20). The National Graphene Institute and Graphene Engineering and\\n Innovation Centre are establishing Manchester as the major global hub for graphene and 2D\\n materials research and commercialisation. We sit at the heart of Manchester’s vibrant Oxford\\n Road Innovation District and are developing the former UMIST campus into a city-centre world-\\n class Innovation District (£1.5bn).\\n Our health research delivers benefits through our partnership with the NHS Trusts in Health\\n Innovation Manchester and the Manchester Academic Health Science Centre within the context\\n of a devolved health and social care budget (£6bn p.a.), including our Biomedical Research Centre\\n (£28.5m) and NIHR Applied Research Collaboration (£8.5m). Our Wellcome Trust funded\\n Translation Manchester (£3.6m) facilitates smooth translation pathways. The benefits of this\\n infrastructure are detailed in our Panel A submissions. Our university-wide COVID-19 Rapid\\n Research Response group coordinated a multidisciplinary contribution to address the crisis,\\n including £4.2m UKRI research awards and over 8,000 patients recruited to 73 GM clinical studies.\\n Regionally, our research informs GM strategy and policy. Our President co-led the GM Local\\n Industrial Strategy (LIS), informed by the GM and Cheshire East Science and Innovation Audit\\n that we also co-led. Our GM Inclusive Growth Analysis Unit, co-funded with the Joseph Rowntree\\n Foundation (£400k), developed evidence-based policies for economic growth and poverty\\n                                                                                               Page 5\\n\\n\\n reduction. Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research on Ageing supported the design of\\n GM’s Ageing Strategy, enabling GM to become the UK’s first city and region to achieve World\\n Health Organization age-friendly status. We are core participants in GM’s devolved health and\\n social care partnership. Digital Futures researchers support GM’s ambitions to be a top five\\n European digital city region; including collaboration with GCHQ’s new base in Manchester. Our\\n climate and environment research informs GM’s carbon-reduction strategy led by Tyndall Centre\\n Manchester and Manchester Environmental Research Institute. Our contributions to GM’s cultural\\n sector and creative economy accelerated through the launch of Creative Manchester, supported\\n by University endowment investment.\\n Our public engagement excellence is accredited with a National Co-ordinating Centre for Public\\n Engagement Gold Engage Watermark. A public engagement academic lead and professional\\n team coordinate activity, including through our public-facing Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre, John\\n Rylands Library, Manchester Museum and Whitworth Art Gallery. Research-led public\\n engagement is supported through training, mentoring and funding, and is recognised, rewarded\\n and celebrated. We work with community partners through citizen science projects, patient and\\n public involvement and engagement in health and medical research, and other forms of\\n participatory research. Public events promoting understanding of research attracted >2m\\n attendance (2014-19, HE-BCI).\\n v)       Research integrity, including Open Research\\n We foster the highest standards of research integrity with senior leadership (Vice-President)\\n oversight of research governance, ethics and integrity (RGEI), supported by an Academic Director,\\n a University Research Ethics committee and a RGEI office. Our Code of Good Research Conduct\\n includes a robust and independent process for investigating alleged misconduct and aligns with\\n the UUK Concordat to Support Research Integrity. Regular research conduct, integrity, data\\n protection and export compliance training is mandatory for all staff undertaking research. PGRs\\n complete subject-specific training in research conduct and integrity, the same mandatory training\\n as staff, and can access advanced research conduct training opportunities.\\n Our RGEI includes commitment to research reproducibility (Section 4) and creating an Open\\n Research environment. We were an early signatory of DORA and endorse the Leiden Manifesto\\n and responsible metrics principles through our Statement on Research Publication Metrics.\\n Hence, we assess output quality through peer review, not journal metrics. Our Open Research\\n Strategy is led by our National Research Library, working with a forum that mobilises our academic\\n community.\\n ORCID registration is mandatory. The REF Open Access (OA) requirements are met by 97% of\\n submitted and ~90% of in-scope outputs. OA is supported by our publications repository (PURE),\\n data repository and a Library OA service, delivered by dedicated professional teams. Our\\n institutional OA budget (£300,000 pa) supplements external funding for article processing charges\\n (APC), OA monographs and ECR attendance at OpenCon. The Library and Manchester University\\n Press are trialling OA innovations and preparing implementation of Plan S principles. This includes\\n an OA journal that does not operate the APC model to help drive the development of the UK-SCL\\n model policy; publisher negotiations for compliant transformative agreements, and additional\\n support for OA monographs.\\n A refreshed 5-year strategy, launched in 2020, following University-wide consultation, focuses\\n on:\\n i)   research leadership, creativity and team collaboration at all career stages;\\n ii)  interdisciplinary themes of digital, creative and environment;\\n iii) civic and international partnerships;\\n iv)  producing benefits on a regional, national and global scale;\\n v)   research-led innovation, enterprise and commercialisation;\\n vi)  research culture and environment with exemplary research integrity, open research, and\\n      equality diversity and inclusion.\\n                                                                                               Page 6\\n\\n\\n 3. People\\n 3.1 Staff strategy and support\\n People are at the centre of the University’s strategic plan (Section 1). Our policies, infrastructure\\n and transparent expectations help staff reach their potential and our collective ambitions. Our\\n academic and research staff profile is diverse (42% women, 21% BAME, 3.8% declared disability,\\n 7.8% LBGT) and 36% EU/overseas. In our latest Staff Survey (2019, 69% response rate) >80%\\n of academics and research staff said the University is a good place to work.\\n The University’s Statement of Research Expectations summarises academic expectations for\\n producing outputs, funding and impact; professional conduct, including research integrity and\\n collegial service; and our institutional responsibility to provide a vital, inclusive and well-resourced\\n environment. The Statement informs recruitment, performance development reviews and\\n progression decisions against transparent criteria in four domains: research, teaching, knowledge\\n transfer and external engagement, and service to the University and the academic profession.\\n Employment policies exceed minimum statutory requirements for flexible, remote and part-time\\n working arrangements, career breaks, family-related leave, and childcare support that includes\\n two award-winning nurseries on campus. Comprehensive wellbeing services and activities for all\\n staff and students are provided through an annual investment of >£250k in sports facilities, online\\n mental health support and in-house counselling, occupational health and disability support\\n services.\\n A similar proportion of research staff and REF eligible academics are employed part-time (13%).\\n Most research staff (92%) and a minority of REF eligible academics (8%) have externally funded\\n fixed-term contracts. Their career stability and progression is supported by transfer to open-ended\\n contracts after four years continuous service and extensive development opportunities from the\\n outset (Section 3.4).\\n 3.2 Equality, diversity and inclusion\\n The University’s EDI commitment and action plan progress is recognised through accreditations\\n (Figure 4).\\n                      Figure 4 – University of Manchester EDI accreditations\\n Our Dignity at Work policy for staff and students implements zero tolerance of discrimination,\\n harassment or bullying, supported by our specialist team and reporting channels.\\n Equality targets are embedded alongside the other key performance indicators (KPIs) in UoM’s\\n strategic plan, mobilising improvements in the gender and BAME profile of our staff (Figure 5).\\n                                                                                                    Page 7\\n\\n\\n                 Figure 5 - University of Manchester’s EDI KPIs and processes\\n 3.3 Research career development\\n Extensive professional and career development opportunities are provided for all career stages\\n and pathways (Figure 6).\\n                            Figure 6 – Career development pathways\\n                                                                                          Page 8\\n\\n\\n 3.3.1 Academic career development\\n Early Career Academics (ECAs) and research staff (ECRs) complete the New Academics and\\n Researchers’ Programme (AdvanceHE accredited) as part of their probation. A third of this training\\n programme focuses on research, innovation and impact, and PGR supervision. A tailored\\n programme for research fellows, with a focus on research leadership, developed and piloted with\\n ~90 Presidential Fellows in 2018-20, is being rolled out to all research fellows.\\n ECAs are supported through probation (normally three years) with transparent expectations set at\\n the outset (in line with the University’s Statement of Research Expectations see 3.1), completion\\n of the above training programme, resources available through their Research Development team\\n and an academic mentor.\\n All academics and research staff are offered annual professional development reviews (PDR),\\n >80% take-up each year. Career development is discussed as part of the PDR, including in-house\\n training opportunities in research, innovation and leadership. Each year in total our academic and\\n research staff complete >2,000 online courses and >1,000 places on workshops and leadership\\n training programmes offered by our Staff Learning and Development Team and our Institute of\\n Teaching and Learning.\\n Peer mentoring is embedded. Peer review is mandatory for most external research funding\\n applications, with mock interviews for applicants called to interview. Faculties run regular grant-\\n writing workshops and arrange peer-review feedback for outputs in preparation and once\\n published (further detail is in the UoA environment statements).\\n All academics can apply for academic leave to initiate or complete an ambitious programme of\\n research or impact activities (one semester/year after six semesters/years or pro rata part-time\\n leave). The majority of proposals are approved (>75 %), reaching 90-100% in some UoAs.\\n 3.3.2 Early Career Research Staff\\n We have held the EC HR Excellence in Research Award since 2011 recognising our full adoption\\n of the principles of the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. Our\\n Concordat action plans for biennial reviews have transformed the research environment for our\\n circa 2,000 research staff. Achievements include improved engagement through research staff\\n forums; creation of a specific promotions track for researchers and automatic transition on to an\\n open-ended contract after four years’ continuous service; visibility and recognition through a\\n research excellence award scheme, an annual in-house conference; and research collaboration\\n funding for research staff. Enhanced support for Principal Investigators in their role as line\\n managers has been developed alongside innovative training programmes. Tailored support for\\n research staff wellbeing has been implemented to supplement the University’s wellbeing services,\\n complementing ongoing Concordat-related initiatives.\\n The professional training and development programmes offered to PGRs and research staff map\\n onto the VITAE Researcher Development Framework. These build upon our New Academics and\\n Researchers Programme with additional courses supporting publishing, grant writing, knowledge\\n transfer and impact (including pathways into industry, entrepreneurship and research\\n commercialisation), and research leadership to forge independent careers. Training is\\n complemented by mentoring and coaching programmes, and an organised peer support network.\\n The University Statement of Expectations on the Career Development of Researchers explains\\n the responsibilities of the institution, the academic line-manager, and researchers themselves. It\\n recommends ten days p.a. for professional development. Progress to embed this recommendation\\n is being made: 60% of research staff undertake at least one formal development and training\\n opportunity each year; one-third are mentored or coached; and one-third have at least seven days\\n of professional development.\\n ECRs are exposed to a range of career options and networks. Over the REF period >150 PDRAs\\n had placements or secondments through our KTPs, IAAs and related schemes. Outgoing\\n fellowships and industrial placements are funded by the BBSRC Flexible Talent Mobility Accounts\\n and other schemes. Over half of our research staff engaged with non-academic partners as part\\n                                                                                              Page 9\\n\\n\\n of their research and impact activities. We collaborate in the Prosper initiative to enhance\\n postdoctoral career success in industry (£4.4m, Research England Development Fund).\\n This comprehensive infrastructure has enhanced researcher’ calibre and career progression;\\n including a 10% increase in promotion rates for research staff, reaching an average 147\\n promotions p.a., and a rapid increase in the numbers completing the AdvanceHE-accredited\\n Leadership in Education Awards Programme (LEAP) for teaching excellence and internal\\n leadership programmes (~350 research staff since 2018). Investment for research staff fellowship\\n applications, including institutional match funding, expanded the number of our externally funded\\n research fellows across the REF period to 355 employed in 2020. Increased investment in\\n internally funded fellows nearly doubled with the Presidential Fellows recruitment of future leaders\\n (£5.1m of total £10.4m), which increased the international profile of our fellows through\\n appointments made from 24 countries.\\n 3.3.3 Postgraduate research students\\n UoM Doctoral College delivers a training and funding environment that prepares ~4,000 PGRs to\\n further their careers. Substantial competitive funding (>£116m) from UKRI and major charities\\n (Wellcome Trust, BHF) support Centres for Doctoral Training (CDT or DTC) and Doctoral Training\\n Partnerships (DTPs). We currently lead 12 CDT/DTPs and partner in 11 others; 20% of our PGRs\\n are registered with a CDT/DTP programme. We invest in UoM studentships (approximately £6.7m\\n p.a.). Our President’s Doctoral Scholar Awards enhance support for the most outstanding PGRs\\n with >100 studentships each year (£2.5m over four years) and a bespoke training programme\\n focusing on research leadership and impact.\\n Academic supervision is supported through a PGR supervisor toolkit, new supervisor training and\\n an online system (eProg) that monitors progression against milestones, including year-end\\n reviews. We support supervisors’ applications for UKCGE-accreditation and 7% of UKCGE-\\n accredited supervisors are from UoM. In the PGR Experience Survey 92% of our PGRs report\\n that their supervisor has the skills and subject knowledge to support their research.\\n PGRs complete an annual skills and development needs audit in discussion with their supervisory\\n team, from which a tailored training programme is devised. The extensive training menu is\\n designed by the Doctoral College and maps onto the VITAE Research Development Framework,\\n as for research staff (3.3.2 above).\\n We prepare PGRs for a range of careers. PGRs are offered placements and internships in\\n industrial, government, clinical and cultural organisations. They explore career plans and options\\n at the annual Pathways event, hosted by the Careers Service. Our Masood Enterprise Centre\\n (MEC) trains PGRs in commercialisation and entrepreneurship; over 750 PGRs took this training\\n or participated in entrepreneurial competitions such as Venture Further over the REF period. MEC\\n partners with UCL to evidence how knowledge exchange activities can benefit PGR career\\n development. Over 300 gained LEAP programme accreditation for teaching excellence (3.3.2\\n above).\\n The publications record of our PGRs illustrates their excellence: 22% of our REF-submitted\\n articles include a PGR author and 48% published during the REF period, including a rapid increase\\n in the thesis by publication format to 32% of all doctorates awarded in 2020. PGRs achievements\\n are celebrated through the PGR Excellence Awards. Nearly half progress into university\\n employment (~35%) or research positions in other sectors (~13%).\\n 3.4 EDI in our REF Submission Institutional Code of Practice\\n EDI principles were applied throughout the preparation of our REF submission, including EDI and\\n unconscious bias training for all staff involved in decision-making. Equality impact assessments\\n (EIA) embedded EDI principles to inform and improve decision-making. The EIA results show no\\n major discrepancies and EDI progress since REF2014, although some gender and ethnicity\\n differences remain. Women accounted for one-third of our REF output and ICS authors, but a\\n slightly lower average number of outputs (2 vs 2.3 for men). BAME staff submitted a similar\\n average number of outputs to White staff, but were under-represented among ICS authors (BAME\\n staff comprised 15% of our REF submission and 7% of our ICS authors).\\n                                                                                              Page 10\\n\\n\\n 4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n 4.1 Support for acquiring research funding\\n Our University Statement of Research Expectations commits to providing services and\\n infrastructure to enable researchers to secure external research funding. This commitment has\\n helped deliver growth in our research income and market share over the REF period, accompanied\\n by significant UKRI income in-kind; with our interdisciplinary research institutes and other\\n collaborative vehicles driving much of this success (Section 2.ii-iii).\\n                      Figure 7 - Research and Business Engagement Services\\n Comprehensive Research and Business Engagement professional services work with\\n researchers from project inception to completion, with specialist teams to support grant writing and\\n project management for major collaborative bids, impact-generating activities, development and\\n management of industry collaboration and strategic partnerships, and commercialisation (Figure\\n 7). Faculty arranged peer review of applications (Section 3.3.1) are supplemented for large\\n strategic calls with a University-wide peer-review process under senior oversight (Vice-President\\n Research), to ensure quality and priorities are met. This support through professional service and\\n academic peer review has produced above sector average success rates; for example our UKRI\\n success rate was 38% by volume and 35% by revenue compared to the sector average 28% and\\n 27% (2015-2020).\\n Through EDI monitoring we identify where specific groups (ECRs, women, BAME staff or staff\\n with disabilities) are under-represented in applications and awards. These data inform workshops\\n to support applications, our internal peer review arrangements and feedback, and decisions when\\n assembling large research teams for major funding calls. Our EDI commitment is threaded through\\n post-award support, including access to OA and impact resources (Section 2 iv-v) and research\\n facilities (Section 4.2 below).\\n                                                                                              Page 11\\n\\n\\n 4.2 Research infrastructure and facilities\\n Our investment in research infrastructure and facilities (~£584m) is part of one of the biggest\\n investments in facilities undertaken in any UK university. Investment decisions are driven by the\\n University’s strategic plan and shaped by national and regional priorities and opportunities for\\n collaboration (Section 2 iv). Over the REF period £389m was secured from external sources for\\n capital investment, including £28m ERDF funding and £80m in five UKRPIF awards.\\n Our strategy delivers state-of-the-art, fit-for-purpose equipment underpinned with well-qualified,\\n well-resourced technical support. Many parts of this infrastructure are used by academics and\\n industry partners from across the world.\\n The University of Manchester Library is the only National Research Library in the north of\\n England. With >10m items, it is the largest non-legal deposit library in the UK, holding the most\\n extensive digital collections of any UK academic library. Ranked second in the UK and globally\\n within the top five for its university special collections; in a number of fields it is world leading. The\\n collections are accessible with curation-enhanced digital imaging facilities.\\n Our research IT infrastructure includes:\\n \\uf0b7   High Performance and High Throughput Computing (HPC/HTC) including ‘free-at-point-\\n     of-use’ access for smaller-scale users. Over £6m was invested in these platforms over the\\n     REF period. Collaboration in the N8 Centre of Excellence in Computationally Intensive\\n     Research (CIR) provides an EPSRC Tier-2 Graphics Processing Unit-based HPC platform.\\n \\uf0b7   Research Software Engineer team (25 FTE) provide a fully cost-recovered service, ensuring\\n     service continuity and institutional memory between projects.\\n \\uf0b7   Research applications support and training covers programming, software engineering\\n     and research IT facilities.\\n \\uf0b7   Research data storage (8TB) per researcher, with higher requirements costed into grants.\\n \\uf0b7   Digital innovation though significant IT investment (£5m in REF period; £15m total) to extend\\n     the digitisation, curation and access to the University’s cultural assets and to support Open\\n     Research.\\n Our Faculty of Science and Engineering (FSE, Panel B) has a substantial portfolio of large\\n equipment infrastructure, the majority of which is shared internally by research groups and\\n externally with other academic and industry partners. UoM’s Jodrell Bank Observatory (JBO)\\n operates the UK’s e-MERLIN telescope array, involved in global observation networks, funded by\\n the STFC and EC. JBO hosts the international Square Kilometre Array (SKA) headquarters\\n (since 2017), one of three global SKA sites and governed by an intergovernmental treaty. SKA\\n HQ was financed by UK public monies (£10.8m) and UoM investment (£5.7m), with our\\n astronomers leading technical development projects.\\n UoM hosts the Henry Royce Institute, the UK’s national facility for advanced materials;\\n accessible to external HEIs and industry. EPSRC invested £150m in capital build and cutting-edge\\n equipment between 2015 and 2020. The 2D materials core theme of the Royce is underpinned by\\n equipment offered through the University’s National Graphene Institute and the Graphene\\n Engineering Innovation Centre. Other examples are the world-leading £11m Henry Moseley X-\\n ray Imaging Facility and the National Grid Power Systems Research Centre (largest UK\\n university high-voltage laboratory).\\n We operate a number of EPSRC National Research Facilities (NRFs), including in electron\\n paramagnetic resonance. Our ~£5m suite of facilities for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)\\n provides a spoke of the EPSRC NRF and took delivery of a ‘world first’ spectrometer for hard XPS\\n in 2018. In 2020, we were chosen to host the hub of the new £10m NRF for laboratory X-ray\\n computed tomography. Our Michael Barber Centre for Collaborative Mass Spectrometry\\n supports >30 University and 18 external research groups and companies. UoM is a founding, Tier-\\n 1, academic partner of EPSRC-supported UK Community for Analytical Measurement. The\\n Dalton Nuclear Institute’s Cumbrian Facility, part of the National Nuclear User Facility, provides\\n the most advanced nuclear research capability in the UK for academic and industry collaboration.\\n                                                                                                    Page 12\\n\\n\\n It includes the Industrial Strategy Challenge funded RAIN (Robotics in AI and Nuclear) specialist\\n facilities supporting collaboration with Sellafield Nuclear Site. UoM is the hub for the International\\n Centre for Advanced Materials (£732m BP, £6.6m UoM), providing BP with access to extensive\\n research infrastructure and University expertise. UoM hosted the EPSRC Supergen Bioenergy\\n Hub and hosts and co-directs three of the EPSRC Supergen Hubs (2018–22: Bioenergy, Energy\\n Systems, Offshore Renewable Energy). Tyndall Manchester is one of four core partners in the\\n UK Tyndall Centre for Climate Change. FSE researchers play major roles in developing and using\\n the ATLAS detector at CERN, lead the UK catalysis hub at the EPSRC-funded National\\n Laboratories at Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, and are major users of other Harwell\\n facilities, in particular Diamond Light Source.\\n Our Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health (BMH, Panel A) offers extensive platform\\n technologies, most operated with, or available to, NHS and academic partners, including Core\\n Laboratory Facilities (Bioimaging including super resolution microscopes; Biological Mass\\n Spectrometry; Biomolecular analysis; Electron Microscopy; Flow Cytometry including single\\n cell systems; Genomic Technologies with integrated bioinformatics support; Histology;\\n Proteomics). Over £28m has been invested in the equipment base (plus >£14m from UoM),\\n staffing has increased from 33 staff in 2014 to 49 in 2020, and turnover has increased from <£2m\\n in 2014 to ~£3.5m in 2020. An extensive Biological Services Facility provides a wide range of\\n model organisms and with strategic investment from Wellcome now incorporates Genome\\n Editing. The Facility is one of the largest in Europe, with 9000sqm of usable space, turnover of\\n £2.5m, 42 FTE staff (38 in 2014), £1.4m investment since 2014, including the construction of a\\n germ-free facility. Core Imaging Facilities (preclinical and clinical PET, MR and PET-MR\\n imaging), Manchester Clinical Research Facility, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre (£28.5m,\\n the largest outside the southeast of England) and Manchester Clinical Trials Unit are run jointly\\n with our partner NHS trusts. The Faculty hosts the Wellcome Centre for Cell-Matrix Research\\n (£6.6m) and the Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre (MRC and philanthropy £13m), the largest\\n single-site discovery proteomics centre in Europe. The Proton Beam Therapy and Research\\n Centre (£6m) is jointly run with The Christie hospital, and the University houses the CRUK Major\\n Cancer Centre (£35m) and CRUK Radiotherapy Centre of Excellence (£16.5m). The Oglesby\\n Cancer Research Building houses 150 Manchester Cancer Research Centre scientists and 100\\n support staff in state-of-the-art laboratories (£38m from CRUK and UoM). UoM co-owns the\\n Manchester Science Partnerships which houses >150 research-based businesses and fosters\\n collaborations between SMEs and larger companies, and our co-investment in Citylabs 1.0\\n (£25m) brings together and accelerates collaboration between UoM researchers, NHS and\\n industry.\\n Our Faculty of Humanities (Panels C, D) researchers benefit from a distinctive infrastructure. In\\n addition to discipline-focused and dedicated research laboratories, workshops, and performance\\n spaces, the research environment includes an ESRC-funded secure data access facility\\n (safepod), the collections of John Rylands Library, Whitworth Art Gallery (WAG) and\\n Manchester Museum (MM), and the new data visualisation and behavioural\\n science/economics laboratories housed in the Alliance Manchester Business School which\\n were part-funded with RPIF investment (£9.7m). The WAG and MM are major assets for our\\n interdisciplinary Creative Manchester initiative as sites of research collaboration and public\\n engagement. The WAG collections of over 60,000 artworks are in a building transformed by an\\n award-winning £15m investment in 2015 which included improved research and engagement\\n facilities and new exhibition spaces. The MM collections span more than million objects, from\\n Darwin to Turing, with research collaborations and public engagement further enabled by the\\n £13m investment (2019–22) to create expanded exhibition space and new South Asia and\\n Chinese Culture galleries.\\n Our TRAC demonstrates £239m research equipment spend from 2013 to 2020. Faculty leadership\\n teams identify and enable the most effective and efficient ways of delivering a sustainable world\\n class equipment and computing infrastructure with University-level oversight and coordination.\\n The substantial STEM infrastructure and procurement is managed by dedicated Faculty-level\\n facilities groups in BMH and FSE to ensure sustainable operation, collaborative and shared use,\\n                                                                                                Page 13\\n\\n\\n competitive access to support the highest-quality science, and significant external use by HEIs\\n and industry alike, contributing to delivering impact through partnerships.\\n Measures exist to ensure that the equipment can be accessed by all. For example, Schools\\n support ECR access (including PGRs) while they establish a grant portfolio to fund access\\n charges. This approach also incentivises the ECR cohort to develop collaborations with\\n established researchers.\\n 4.3 Supporting the reproducibility of research\\n UoM is a member of the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN). Our UKRN academic lead and Open\\n Research forum catalyse development of open research practices across the University.\\n Awareness and capability is built through events, training, mutual learning through innovation\\n exemplars, and advice through the Library-run online forum. Our research IT strategy includes\\n investment in a work programme to engage researchers in trialling and recommending tools to\\n support open research practices, including data management (Section 4.2 above).\\n                                                                                          Page 14\\n ', 'b_env']\n",

We undertake excellent research that makes a genuine difference:\\nlocally, nationally, internationally.\\nHighlight achievements include:\\n     •   High-quality research environment: £1.1bn research grant income (55% increase since\\n         REF2014). £720m infrastructure investment since REF2014, including £310m on research\\n         equipment and facilities.\\n     •   Impact: sector-leading support for developing research into real-world impact with\\n         successes across all sectors.\\n             o   A 40-fold increase in IP revenue to £57.5m, 5th highest in the UK.\\n             o   Expansion of our unique translational Advanced Manufacturing Group, a UK\\n                 exemplar of university-led economic development. The Advanced- and Nuclear-\\n                 Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres have developed long-term collaborative\\n                 relationships with over 160 companies, including many of the UK’s leading\\n                 manufacturers, and host two of seven High Value Manufacturing Catapult hubs\\n                 (£90m).\\n     •   A pipeline of future talent: 391 externally funded research fellowships from all major\\n         research funders, including Research Councils, Wellcome NIHR, Trust, Royal Society, the\\n         Academies, and the EU, with a total value >£103m. A successful culture of PGR\\n         recruitment and training with 4,739 doctoral awards (44% women), including 20\\n         competitively awarded CDTs and DTPs.\\n     •   Improving diversity: a supportive research environment where diversity is valued, as\\n         evidenced by being the only university in the Sunday Times ‘Top 100 best not-for-profit\\n         organisations to work for’ three years running; a Stonewall Top 100 Employer for seven\\n         years running; and holding an Athena SWAN silver institutional award.\\n     •   15% growth in our research community to 2,961 (1,584 Category A and 1,377 research\\n         staff).\\nStrategic leadership comes from our University Executive Board, which includes Vice-Presidents\\nboth for research and for innovation.\\nWe value and nurture research leadership in our organisation and support individuals to secure\\nprestigious leadership awards across career stages. Examples include Professor Neil Hunter’s\\nERC Synergy Grant; research professorships including 6 RAEng Research Chairs (all with\\nindustrial partners); 10 UKRI Future Leader Fellowships. We value and reward leadership in the\\nsector through the academic citizenship component of our Academic Career Pathway (Section 2).\\n                                                                                                Page 1\\n\\n\\n  2. Strategy\\nResearch and research leadership are at the heart of our Vision. Our objective is to enable and\\nactively promote a culture of research excellence across our University community, delivering\\ninternationally recognised outputs, supported by sector-leading research income and facilities.\\nInstitutional strategy is developed through Research Strategy Group, comprising Vice-President\\nResearch (VP-R) and Faculty Directors of R&I. The University R&I Committee provides oversight\\nand quality assurance. Our strategy supports research activity at different scales to enable\\nexcellent research and effective translation:\\n     1) Individual support (see Section 3).\\n     2) Units are empowered to develop strategies reflecting their disciplinary research strengths.\\n     3) Institutional support focuses on interdisciplinary research to tackle broad societal\\n         challenges.\\nWe foster researcher-led interdisciplinary centres. Our Insigneo Institute for in-silico Medicine is\\nan exemplar; it is Europe’s largest institute dedicated to biological modelling, imaging and\\ninformatics in healthcare. 150 staff from 28 departments have been awarded £54m, leading to\\nimproved diagnostic tools for better clinical decision-making.\\nSometimes real scale and ambition require ‘top down’ direction. Our 2014 programme of\\ninstitutional investment funded three pilot projects: £8.8m for 16 new academic posts, 5\\nfellowships, 36 PGR scholarships and £5.45m for new facilities. ‘The Florey Institute’, ‘Imagine’\\nand ‘P3’ bridged the gap between research and translation in antimicrobial resistance, super\\nresolution imaging and plant science.\\nIn 2018, we evolved this strategy, launching four ambitious Flagship Institutes: Energy;\\nNeuroscience; Sustainable Food; and Healthy Lifespan. Selected through open competition on\\nthe basis of outstanding academic strength, diversity, scale, leadership, societal relevance and\\npartnership opportunities, we invested £10m into professorial and senior research fellowships and\\n£3.7m for 40 PGR scholarships. Early achievements include:\\n     •   Energy has a bold vision to increase access to affordable, secure and sustainable energy\\n         globally through identifying reliable low-carbon solutions to energy challenges. In 2019, it\\n         secured £21m from BEIS and ERDF for a Translational Energy Research Centre to\\n         investigate industrial decarbonisation.\\n     •   Sustainable Food takes a systems approach to change the way we think about food from\\n         farm to fork. Collaborating across five faculties, it has secured a £7.5m multi-partner, multi-\\n         disciplinary UKRI award from the Strategic Priorities Fund, indicating national leadership in\\n         the field.\\n                                                                                                 Page 2\\n\\n\\nResearch networks and partnerships\\nIndividual researchers are enabled to develop\\nmeaningful relationships with national and international\\npartners through visiting positions, secondments, study\\nleave, conference attendance/hosting, joint scholarships\\nand funding for exploratory trips, e.g. Professor Maisha\\nWester came to our School of English through a\\nFulbright scholarship, going on to be awarded a British\\nAcademy Global Professorship.\\n81% of our outputs in this period had external co-\\nauthors, 45% had international co-authors.\\nUnits support academic collaboration and external\\npartnerships through externally funded grant\\nopportunities. For example, Engineering is a key player\\nin several EPSRC manufacturing hubs, including leadership for the £28m Future Electrical\\nMachines Manufacturing focused on addressing key challenges for UK industry.\\nInstitutionally we fund participation in the Worldwide Universities Network, and, nationally, the N8\\n(northern research-intensive universities) and the White Rose (Yorkshire), alongside strategic\\npartnerships with the Sheffield City Region, industry, government departments, the NHS and\\ncultural organisations.\\n    •   HEFCE and institutional investment of £16m in the N8 Agri-Food programme has delivered\\n        180 collaborative projects and £40m research income.\\n    •   Our joint Clinical Research Office with Sheffield Teaching Hospitals enables collaborations\\n        with over 70 honorary clinical staff translating research findings into meaningful patient\\n        benefit.\\n    •   Our strategic partnership with Siemens co-locates their staff in University research facilities\\n        to bridge the gap between discovery, product development and process improvement,\\n        producing major improvements for wind turbine generators.\\nImpact, knowledge exchange and innovation strategy\\nOur objective is to use our transformative research to address the most pressing societal\\nchallenges. Our strategy is to provide financial support and relevant expertise to build external\\npartnerships and deliver impact.\\nWe have been well funded to do this, including the maximum Higher Education Innovation Funding\\n(HEIF) allocation (£21.8m), and £7m of UKRI Impact Acceleration Accounts.\\nThe majority of this funding supports individuals, and external recognition includes five ESRC\\nCelebrating Impact awards, the 2018 NERC Economic Impact Award, and three AHRC New\\nGeneration Thinkers.\\nSupport includes:\\n    •   Professional development, including our pioneering Impact Internship Programme to give\\n        ECRs/PGRs experience of developing and demonstrating impact early in their careers.\\n                                                                                                Page 3\\n\\n\\n    •    Specific recognition of impact in our Academic Career Pathway (see Section 2). Impact can\\n         be the basis for reward, promotion, workload allocation and study leave.\\n    •    Funding to grow and strengthen a high-quality impact pipeline. During the period, £13.6m\\n         has funded 270 proof-of-concept projects, collaborative R&D and secondments. 20% of our\\n         impact cases have benefited from this seed funding.\\n    •    Generous consultancy arrangements: 267 staff have worked with >280 partners.\\n         Consultancy for Public Health England enabled a technology-supported approach that\\n         helped 600,000 of the UK’s least physically active citizens do more exercise.\\nOur tech transfer team provides expert support to commercialise IP generated by units. Our\\nethos is to use our IP primarily for the benefit of society, rather than to generate income.\\nWe have invested in expanding the team and created an IP\\nDevelopment and Commercialisation fund. Since 2016,\\n£3m has been invested in proof-of-concept and seed-\\nfunding for companies to ensure spinouts are significantly\\nmore attractive to private investment. External consultants\\nprovide market analysis and advise on positioning\\nspinouts. We have funded 64 projects across every faculty,\\ncreated 16 companies and leveraged external investment\\nof £5m. IP revenue has grown 40-fold to £57.5m; 5th\\nhighest in the UK.\\nRinri Therapeutics is an exemplar of our approach: £21k\\nproof-of-concept funding in 2017 enabled the spinout to\\nraise £1.2m seed investment in 2019.\\nA £5m Connecting Capabilities Fund grant from Research England funded our regional\\ncollaboration with Manchester and Leeds to create Northern Gritstone, an investment company\\ntargeting an initial fund of £150m with a further £250-£500m by year four, which will invest in a\\nrange of companies based on University IP.\\nAs an institution, we have focused on research-led economic growth and cultural vibrancy.\\nWe have created the UK’s first research-led Advanced Manufacturing Innovation District. This\\ndemonstrates the economic and social development possible when industrially relevant research\\ndrives collaboration with industry, local and central government, leading to massive inward\\ninvestment. Companies and their supply chain have relocated to this brownfield site, creating jobs\\nin an economically disadvantaged area. Factory 2050 (opened 2016) translates excellent research\\njointly with our academic base in data, robotics and VR-prototyping to address real-world\\nchallenges in manufacturing and enable industry to de-risk technologies. It is a magnet for further\\ninvestment: in 2018 Boeing opened its first new-build factory for 30 years, creating 87 highly skilled\\njobs; McLaren followed in 2019 with its first production facility.\\nWe have extended this successful model to other regions: AMRC Cymru, a £20m state-of-the-art\\nR&D facility in the Deeside Enterprise Zone, described by Welsh government ministers as a ‘game\\nchanger’, opened in 2019. It provided the fabrication location for the Government’s Ventilator\\nChallenge in 2020. Other sites include AMRC North West (Preston, 2019, digital manufacturing\\nand battery assembly) and Nuclear AMRC Midlands (Derby, 2019).\\n                                                                                               Page 4\\n\\n\\nOur research influences the city region to support its development as a cultural destination.

During the period half a million visitors to our\\nfestivals have brought £1.2m into the creative economy.\\n     •  Our award-winning Festival of the Mind, co-created with Sheffield’s creative and digital\\n        community, brings research to life in exciting and innovative ways.\\n     •  Off the Shelf is the third largest and most accessible literary festival in the UK with an\\n        audience of 80,000.\\nProgress towards an open research environment\\nWe created our first repository 15 years ago and\\nencourage a research culture that is open for the benefit\\nof society. Exemplary systems include a publication\\nrepository shared with Leeds and York, a data\\nrepository using the Figshare platform, and a mediated\\ndeposit service, reducing the burden on researchers\\nwhile ensuring compliance with copyright and other\\nstipulations.\\nWe have built on this foundation with effective\\nleadership, policy, training, and advocacy. Institutional\\npolicy requires ‘green’ OA and 82% of our outputs\\nsince 2015 are open access placing us 32nd globally\\nin the 2020 Leiden Ranking. 35,500 outputs were\\ndeposited during this REF period, with the annual rate\\nmore than doubling. There have been 4.2m downloads of these papers.\\nWe have invested £250k in the White Rose University Press, co-created with Leeds and York in\\n2016. An innovative digital OA publisher, it can support small and experimental publications and\\nformats, such as data journals, with licences that enable researchers to reuse our work. An OA\\nmonograph of the Madeleine Blaess diaries (2018) has >4,300 downloads (the average academic\\nprint-run is 400) while the license has enabled widely used resources for KS3-5 teaching.\\nWe recognise there is more to do nationally; we support the move to full, immediate OA (Plan S).\\nOur staff are engaging with the debate through editorial positions and roles in learned societies\\nand supporting sector leadership via the UUK/JISC Collections Strategy group.\\nOur open data repository hosts some of the most discussed datasets worldwide (Rae, Stafford)\\nand supports the sharing of software, protocols, and reports, encouraging open research\\nthroughout the research lifecycle.\\nOur VP-R chairs an Open Research Advisory Group providing strategic oversight. We are a\\nfounder member of the UK Reproducibility Network and have invested in academic leadership. Our\\nResearch Practice Lead has developed an institutional statement on open research, coordinates\\n                                                                                                   Page 5\\n\\n\\ntranslation of policy into good practice, and encourages grassroots participation and best-practice\\nsharing.\\nOur researchers are national and international advocates and leaders. Professor Stephen Pinfield\\nis external advisor to UUK and JISC. Professor James Wilsdon chaired the group that produced\\nThe Metric Tide report and leads international debate through the £3.2m Research on Research\\nInstitute co-founded with Wellcome Trust, Digital Science and Leiden University.\\nProfessional development and support include tailored advice on data management plans ensuring\\nprojects have strategies to maximise data sharing. PGRs receive training to embed open research\\nearly in their careers; data management plans and OA thesis deposits (>4,500 since 2014) are\\nmandatory.\\nMajor digitised resources are openly accessible, often with innovative digital routes into data\\ncollections. Our open-source software benefits the economy, such as the GATE text engineering\\nplatform used by Oracle, BBC, and the Press Association.\\nResearch integrity\\nResearch excellence depends on research integrity. We support individuals and units to deliver the\\nhighest standards and best practice in research integrity and ethics. Committed to the Concordat\\nto Support Research Integrity, we have appropriate policies and procedures to ensure the\\nhighest standards of rigour and integrity, and research is conducted according to appropriate\\nethical, legal and professional frameworks.\\nTo embed a culture of ethical behaviour which is valued and encourages challenge, we set clear\\nexpectations, outlining both good and unacceptable practices in areas such as authorship, data\\nmanagement, collaboration, public engagement. Focussed workshops discuss and share best\\npractice in emerging aspects of ethics. We were the first HEI to require PGRs to undertake ethics\\nand integrity training (tailored to their discipline), with 91% of the most recent cohort reporting\\nimproved understanding. When defining criteria for responsible research assessment, we are\\nconsidering how they uphold research integrity and avoid incentivising poor practice.\\nTransparent, robust, and fair processes manage allegations of research misconduct, with\\nimpartial investigations using external advice where necessary. Our whistleblowing policy\\nenables staff to raise concerns at a high-level without fear of reprisal. In 2019 we introduced\\n'Report and Support', to enable staff and students who have experienced bullying, harassment,\\nverbal, or physical abuse to report it confidentially.\\n                                                                                                  Page 6\\n\\n\\n  3. People\\nOur research community has a strong sense of identity and values. Central to this is a commitment\\nto champion diversity and inclusion to deliver excellence.\\nStaff development\\nSupporting staff to realise their potential is a key enabler\\nfor our research strategy.\\nWe introduced Academic Career Pathways (ACP) in\\n2018 to provide a transparent framework for career\\ndevelopment. Within the academic and research-\\nspecialist pathways, core and optional criteria allow\\nindividuals to focus on, and develop, their strengths in\\nresearch and leadership. Clear expectations for outputs,\\nimpact, income, PGR supervision and professional\\nstanding at each career stage are proportionally\\nreduced for those with equality-related circumstances\\nincluding part-time working, career breaks, family leave and ill-health.\\nInstitutional policy for research time and resources flexes to take into account individual\\ncircumstances. Our workload allocation model protects time for research, scholarship, and impact;\\nthis increases to accommodate funded investigator time and PGR supervision. All academic staff\\nare entitled to research leave, for impact as well as research, after each seventh semester.\\nAnnual progress reviews are complemented by research-specific planning meetings to discuss\\naspirations for funding, writing and impact, and to signpost relevant support. Consultation identified\\nthat targeted support for mid-career researchers to become research leaders, to apply for strategic\\nor large grants are highly valued and we will continue to develop our provision.\\nWe signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment in 2018, prompting a\\ncritical review of performance assessment. We focus on using the right indicators, rather than\\nthose which are easily accessible: ACP ensures outputs are assessed on their own merit, by those\\nwith disciplinary expertise and never relying on metrics alone. We are changing our recruitment\\npractices to match. We will implement feedback mechanisms for staff to report bad practice with an\\nindependent panel to review cases and recommend improvements.\\nEarly career researcher support\\nAs future research leaders, ECRs are key to our long-term success. In 2014, we invested £10m in\\n34 Vice-Chancellor’s Fellows to grow areas of research strength. Tailored support and skills\\ndevelopment enabled independent research programmes, collaborations, and significant funding\\nawards. All progressed to academic positions, nine advancing to senior lecturer and one to\\nprofessor. They have secured £16.9m in external funding, produced 565 research outputs, and\\nlead on six impact case studies.\\n                                                                                              Page 7\\n\\n\\nWe invested £1m of GCRF-QR funding in 2019 in 13\\nGlobal Challenge ECR Fellows who work with global\\npartners to address challenges faced by developing\\ncountries, from labour exploitation to global food\\nsecurity and tackling plastic waste.\\nWe have had 391 externally funded fellowships in the\\nperiod. Units have developed strategies to attract and\\nretain excellent ECRs. For example, in 2017, the\\nFaculty of Science introduced guaranteed progression\\nto an open-ended contract for fellowships of over 4-\\nyears, attracting 16 high-calibre externally funded\\nfellows.\\nWe have held the HR Excellence in Research Award\\nsince 2012 (renewed 2019) based on our success in exceeding the requirements of the\\nConcordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers:\\n     •   The award-winning Think Ahead programme is a comprehensive framework that gives\\n         ECRs a career trajectory plan and tailored development opportunities corresponding to\\n         Vitae’s Researcher Development Framework, including skills training to support careers\\n         outside of academia. Over 7,000 ECR/PGRs have attended development and work-based\\n         opportunities run by our specialist team.\\n     •   Our research-led mentoring programme has two intakes per year. 667 staff have\\n         undertaken the programme since 2014, benefiting from the support of 245 mentors who\\n         advise on output writing, grant application, PGR supervision and impact.\\n     •   Researchers are entitled to 1 day per month for professional or career development\\n         (exceeding the 10 days in the Concordat). Our ‘Aspire’ and ‘Inspire’ charters set out clear\\n         expectations of ECRs and their managers respectively.\\nPostgraduate research students\\nEnhancing our PGR experience is a key priority in our research strategy. We aim to be the\\ninstitution of choice for PGRs through our research excellence, innovative training, and\\ncommitment to career development and wellbeing.\\nWe have a diverse PGR community of around 4,000, representing 106 countries. 46% are women,\\n7% of UK PGRs are BAME, 13% are disabled. We offer the range of doctoral qualifications\\nincluding EngD, MD and professional doctorates and have made 4,739 awards during the period.\\nOur hub and spoke governance model sees the University PGR Committee agree policy (such as\\nfunded medical and shared parental leave), while Faculty Graduate Schools ensure consistent\\nhigh-quality student support and a network to share good practice in recruitment and progression\\nacross units. Highlight developments include:\\n                                                                                               Page 8\\n\\n\\nRecruitment: We have shifted our focus from quantity\\nto quality, empowering units to identify the size of PGR\\ncommunity they need for a vibrant environment,\\nbalanced against supervisory capacity. We have started\\nto define widening participation in the context of PGR, to\\nensure we offer support and can further diversify our\\napplicant and recruit pools. The Sheffield-led White\\nRose DTP has launched a seminal scheme with the\\nStuart Hall Foundation ring fencing UKRI funded\\nstudentships for Black British PGRs.\\nTo ensure we can achieve our recruitment aims, we\\ninvested £186m in PGR scholarships, including £98m\\nof institutional investment. 20 Centres of Doctoral\\nTraining and Doctoral Training Partnerships have £78m\\nof competitive funding from all of the UK Research Councils, Wellcome and others.\\nPGR wellbeing: a project exploring the pressures on PGRs brought together community\\nconsultation with the literature to make recommendations for change. Units and students were\\nasked a ‘magic wand’ question (what one thing would make the most significant wellbeing\\nimprovement) which enabled prioritisation. All of the high priority issues have been addressed,\\nincluding introduction of mandatory supervisor training; new wellbeing advisors in units; a PGR-\\nspecific hardship fund; funding for medical leave of absence for our own funded students; a peer\\nmentoring scheme.\\nSubmission in tuition-fee paying period: Our four-year submission rates have improved from\\n63% to 79%. Since 2018, our focus has shifted to submission within tuition fee-paying period (now\\na University Council KPI). Our exploration of PGR wellbeing highlighted that unclear and unrealistic\\nexpectations are a major source of poor mental health. This led us to redefine the essential criteria\\nand competencies required to achieve a doctorate so that from 2019 all entrants have a\\nprogramme that gives them a realistic expectation of submission within their tuition fee-paying\\nperiod.\\nProgression and development: Effective induction and systematic peer support ensure new\\nPGRs are welcomed into a supportive environment. Confirmation review by 12 months, and\\nsubmission review at 36, ensure they are on track to submit their thesis within their tuition fee-\\npaying period. There are regular opportunities and funding to present and share research at\\nseminars, journal clubs, retreats, symposia, poster competitions and conferences. 85% of PGRs\\nhave attended a conference and 73% have presented a paper or poster. PGRs are supported to\\nsecure placements, and we offer three-month bursaries to prepare results for publication and to\\ndevelop impact post-submission. Business or public-engagement ideas receive support from a\\ndedicated enterprise team.\\nOur Doctoral Development Programme provides discipline-specific and professional skills training.\\nWe recognise that career pathways are increasingly diverse, and our skills training has evolved in\\nresponse. Training needs analysis provides a personalised programme including taught modules,\\ncareers advice and coaching, thesis mentoring, and placements or collaboration with partners.\\n‘Think Further’ offers development in bite-size pieces through weekly coaching prompts on monthly\\ntopics. We have reviewed our programme to ensure it reflects the revised essential criteria and\\ncompetencies PGRs need to evidence to achieve their doctorate.\\n                                                                                                Page 9\\n\\n\\nSupervisor support: Ensuring supervisors have the right skills to motivate and guide is a key\\npriority. We have introduced mentoring for new supervisors; mandatory CPD for all supervisors\\nbased on supportive peer discussions to explore the practice of supervision rather than simply\\nproviding ‘tick box’ training; and best practice workshops. Our ‘Supervisionaries’ programme\\ncelebrates excellent supervision and ‘associate supervisor’ status enables researchers to be\\nrecognised for formal and informal roles.\\nEquality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI)\\nOur academic and research staff base is diverse: 34.4%\\nare international; 35% are women; 5% self-report as\\ndisabled and 20% as BAME. We know there is more to\\ndo.\\nWe have introduced measures to ensure EDI is\\nconsidered in all decision-making. EDI directors sit on\\nexecutive boards in every unit and faculty. University\\nEDI Committee is chaired by the Deputy VC (herself\\nrecognised in 2017 with an Excellence in Diversity\\nAward) and reports directly to Council. It has\\nrepresentatives from staff networks, such as disability\\nand LGBTQ+ to ensure a voice in policymaking.\\nGender: we hold an Athena SWAN silver institutional\\naward alongside 19 unit awards. Pro-active measures have improved gender balance in leadership\\nroles (a third of University Executive and 40% of Senate are women) and 25% of women\\nacademics are professors (an increase in all faculties). We have the third smallest gender pay gap\\nin the Russell Group and plan to improve this. Our Women Academic Returners Programme\\nprovides protected time and funding for research following family leave, addressing disruption to\\nresearch, career development and progression and helping units to retain female staff. Since 2014,\\n163 women shared £2.1m and consequently secured over £20m of grants, a return of over 800%.\\nIn 2018, UCEA cited the scheme as an example of good practice.\\nRace: 20% of our staff are BAME. Our 2019 strategy and action plan set ambitious targets to\\ntackle under-representation, progression, and attainment as we work towards the Race Equality\\nCharter.\\nLGBTQ+: we won a 2018 HR Excellence Award for Open@TUoS which empowers staff to create\\nan open, inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ staff and students through focussed events,\\ncampaigns, training and initiatives. Disclosure rates have increased by 11% for sexual orientation\\nand by 10% for gender identity. Our work has been recognised in seven consecutive years in\\nStonewall’s Workplace Equality Index: we are in the top 5% of employers and one of only four\\nRussell Group HEIs.\\nWellbeing: is at the heart of the experience of working and studying at Sheffield. We signed the\\nTime to Change Pledge (2014) and the Mental Health Work Commitment (2020), committing us to\\ncreating a positive environment where staff can talk openly and seek help where necessary. A free,\\nindependent, confidential helpline and counselling service 24/7 for staff, students and their families,\\nand a range of online resources support colleagues to manage wellbeing. To identify problems at\\nthe earliest opportunity, we fund Mental Health First Aid training, as well as having a network of\\nwellbeing champions in every unit. We are collaborating with the national charity Mind in the\\n                                                                                              Page 10\\n\\n\\nMentally Healthy Universities Programme to pioneer interventions and share learning with the\\nsector.\\nConsideration of EDI in our REF submission\\nWe consider EDI in developing all core policies, processes, and guidance, mindful of the impact\\nour decisions have on staff with protected characteristics. Our REF Code of Practice placed EDI at\\nthe centre of our preparations, with oversight from REF Steering Group (40% female). All decision-\\nmakers undertook tailored training including recognising and countering implicit bias. We have\\nsubmitted 100% of our Category A Eligible staff. Equality impact assessments on our output\\nscoring and attribution found no evidence of systematic bias. Clear policy statements ensure there\\nwill be no detriment to staff either in their independent researcher status or in the number of their\\noutputs submitted.\\n  4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\nResearch income\\nOur strategy is to secure income which enables excellent research and effective translation across\\nthe three scales: individual, unit and institution.\\nAcademic leadership from the VP-R and Faculty\\nDirectors of Research & Innovation ensures a strategic\\nfocus to identify opportunities which match our strengths\\nand ambitions. For institutional bids we wish to support\\nat scale, they offer significant peer support and\\ncoordinate match funding in excess of £15m annually.\\nInstitutional awards including HEIF, Global Challenges\\nResearch Fund QR, Policy QR and NPIF QR allow\\ntargeted support and pump-priming of new research\\nand growth in existing strengths.\\nProfessional services operate at institutional and unit\\nlevels. 175 FTE provide expert support for grant\\ncapture, management, dissemination and knowledge\\nexchange. We invest in their professional development\\nand career progression through networks, targeted training, and secondments. Institutional-level\\nsupport for interdisciplinary and cross-faculty strategic research teams recognises the challenges\\nof navigating requirements and processes across the institution. An exemplar of our approach is\\nthe combination of academic and professional expertise to manage operational GCRF support and\\ndecision-making. Our leading international development researchers act both as academics and\\nservice delivery partners, offering training and mentorship to colleagues from disciplines new to\\nODA projects. This has led to external funding in units new to working in ODA contexts. For\\nexample, research on music and wellbeing in Colombia and Mexico. Unit-level teams focus on\\ndisciplinary strengths. Structures implemented in 2018 have been transformational. E.g. Arts and\\nHumanities units have increased grant applications by 117% and internal funding for time to write\\nfunding applications resulted in a ten-fold return on investment.\\nSpecific implementation support for large or complex projects requiring cross-organisational\\nworking avoids academic time being unnecessarily taken up piecing together what is required from\\n                                                                                              Page 11\\n\\n\\nacross professional services (Estates, Procurement, Finance, HR). ‘Orange box’ kick-off meetings\\nensure PIs have confidence in timely delivery of the steps required to start complex grants.\\nEvidence of the success of our support includes:\\n    •   £1.1bn of research income over this REF period (a 55% increase on REF2014)\\n    •   48% of our research comes from grants over £1m.\\n    •   Funding from 1,734 individual funders,\\n    •   60% of our grant income was peer-reviewed.\\nSignificant EU funding from Framework and Horizon programmes reflects our strength and\\nalignment with EU priorities. We had 248 projects over the REF period with over 1,700 partners.\\nIndustry income rose by 38% to £27m. 38% of our grants in the period involved collaboration with\\na non-academic partner (£326m), putting us third nationally. For example, in our Flagship\\nNeuroscience Institute, Professor Mimoun Azzouz is academic lead of a €24.5m Pfizer-led\\nInnovative Medicines Initiative.\\nIn-kind income and gifts: we have successfully developed strategic relationships leading to\\nsector-leading levels of in-kind contributions to support research activities, £44.9m in 2018/19 was\\nthe highest nationally1.\\nPhilanthropy supports our research objectives; our new £11m MRI-PET scanner (the only one in\\nthe north of England) was part-funded by £2m of public donations to transform understanding of\\ndiseases and their treatment. Housed in a purpose-built facility, this opened in 2019, is attached to\\nthe Royal Hallamshire Hospital, and forms part of our Neuroscience Flagship.\\nInfrastructure and facilities supporting research\\nA mature estate of physical infrastructure, equipment and facilities supports novel research\\nand its translation.\\nA VP-R led group guides and oversees proposals for\\nequipment and capital to ensure quality, sustainability,\\nand reference to institutional and unit research priorities.\\nA dedicated Capital Research Manager ensures other\\nprofessional support is well coordinated.\\nInvestment of £310m into new and upgraded\\nresearch infrastructure and facilities includes:\\n    •   An interdisciplinary initiative of £10m for\\n        studentships and equipment developed\\n        advanced microscopy to gain new insights into\\n        life and disease.

This includes the £5.2m Research Design Service, supporting\\nresearch across Yorkshire and the Humber, Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health\\nResearch and Care, the School of Public Health and Clinical Trials Research Unit.\\nMaximising the potential of our infrastructure and facilities to deliver world-class research and\\nimpact requires skilled technicians. We are a founding signatory of the Technician Commitment,\\na nationwide scheme to address the challenges facing technical staff. Our action plan ensures\\nvisibility, recognition, career development, and sustainability for our 600 technical staff. Notable\\nachievements include professional registration support, dedicated ‘Our Technicians’ website,\\ncareer profiles, nomination for national awards, reward schemes, TechNet, policies for research\\noutput co-authorship, and collaboration with the National Technician Development Centre.\\nThe AMRC also has a three-year apprenticeship programme. 131 apprentices have taken part in\\nthe programme during the census period. Apprentices progress to a substantive technical position,\\nsupported by a post-apprenticeship development framework. This structured approach allows us to\\nshow our commitment to these staff and support their development to become fully rounded\\ntechnical staff.\\nWe invest in digital infrastructure to support researchers in their day-to-day work, enable and\\npromote collaboration, and support successful funding applications. This includes:\\n    •     £8m p.a. on a comprehensive suite of research software applications.\\n    •     10TB of shared storage for each research project - over 20TB of research data storage in\\n          total.\\n    •     Four High Performance Computing platforms (with a 5th planned) are free to all (900\\n          monthly users) and provide resources to run cutting edge analytical techniques and data\\n          processes.\\n    •     A cluster of more than 120 research virtual machines (totalling nearly 900 CPUs)\\n          configured to support the specific needs of research projects including when working from\\n          home.\\n                                                                                                Page 13\\n\\n\\n    •   Cyber Essentials certified assured computing for a secure and protected environment.

A team of research software\\nengineers (RSE) support individual projects with software for high-performance computing, acting\\nas a critical enabler where recruitment of short-term expertise is difficult. Our RSE service\\nsupported the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium to create an automated, high speed and\\nrobust data pipeline from the gene sequencer into the analysis tooling. This meant that the project\\nwas able to identify and track virus mutations and variants at a vastly higher throughput.\\nTo ensure our digital infrastructure is fit for purpose for the next five years, we are investing £10m\\nto deliver our research and innovation IT strategy, developed through extensive consultation with\\nthe research community. This includes greater use of cloud computing to store, process and\\nanalyse research data, making platforms and tools available to researchers at the point that they\\nare needed. Expanding on our RSE model from Computer Science, we are creating a Data\\nAnalytic Service to support the use of new methodologies and innovative data exploration\\nmethods.

UoB has an international reputation for high-quality scholarship, ranking 49th\\nand 58th in the last two QS World University rankings. In REF2014 UoB was ranked 5th in the UK\\nby research intensity, and our research publications are among the UK top 10 in terms of the\\nproportion of scholarly output in the 10% most highly cited worldwide (Scopus/SciVal, 2015-19).\\nUoB has more than 120 Fellows of national and international academies, such as the Royal\\nSociety (48), British Academy (18), Academy of Medical Sciences (22), Academy of Social\\nSciences (26) and Royal Academy of Engineering (9). UoB has one of the largest concentrations\\nof PhD research training in the UK, leading 28 funded centres and partnerships.\\nUoB is committed to supporting the production of high-quality research, fundamental and applied,\\nacross all disciplines, offering comprehensive support to colleagues at all career stages. Over 91%\\nof our eligible staff were submitted to REF2014 (1137.70 FTE); all are being submitted to REF2021\\n(1,494.08 FTE). Colleagues benefit from a well-established research infrastructure, highly collegial\\nand academically-led research culture, wide disciplinary spread, strong external connections, and\\nfrom workload principles that provide generously for research. Together, these encourage, foster\\nand facilitate the production of world-class research with academic and non-academic impact. The\\nsubstantial funding received from UKRI’s Research Councils, industry and charities is testament to\\nUoB’s research strength and disciplinary diversity. UoB’s affiliations include membership of the\\nRussell Group (RG), Worldwide Universities Network, GW4 Alliance, and Coimbra Group.\\nContext\\nUoB is passionate about economic and societal impact, successfully cultivating close relationships\\nwith many business and civil society organisations, regionally, nationally and internationally. We\\nprovide an excellent and supportive environment for all research.\\nThe Bristol region hosts one of the UK’s most significant and successful high-tech regional\\neconomies and UoB’s business partnerships include major aerospace, fintech and high-tech\\ncompanies, as well as SMEs and organisations such as the Met Office, GCHQ and NHS. UoB is a\\nfounding partner of the world’s top University business incubator, SETsquared, and the award-\\nwinning Engine Shed (ES). We have supported numerous start-ups and scale-ups, and work\\nclosely with Bristol City Council (BCC), the West of England Combined Authority (WECA), and a\\nwide range of civil society organisations, heritage bodies, schools, colleges, and social enterprises.\\nEnhanced external links and collaborations lie at the heart of the development of the new Temple\\nQuarter Enterprise Campus (TQEC) in Bristol City Centre. UoB hosts the National Composites\\nCentre (NCC) and the multi-award-winning Bristol University Press (eight book awards; further five\\nshortlisted since 2017).\\nStructure and Organization\\nUoB comprises 26 Schools across six Faculties: Arts; Engineering; Health Sciences; Life Sciences;\\nScience; Social Sciences and Law. Multi- and inter-disciplinary research is spearheaded by the five\\nUniversity Research Institutes (URIs). UoB has grown during this REF period, to 3,480 academic\\nstaff by April 2020. In 2019/20 it had 2,263 postgraduate research students, 4,939 postgraduate\\ntaught students, and 20,311 undergraduate students.\\n                                                                                                Page 1\\n\\n\\n\\nResponsibility for development of research policy and delivery of strategic research goals rests\\nwith the Pro Vice-Chancellor for Research & Enterprise (PVC-R&E), assisted by three Associate\\nPVC-Rs, the University Research Committee (URC) and Research & Enterprise Development\\n(RED), a well-resourced central services division offering support for all aspects of research and\\nimpact. Input into research strategy from across UoB is ensured by URC, which includes the PVC-\\nR&E, PVC-Health, Associate PVC-Rs, six Faculty Research Directors (FRDs) and representatives\\nfrom RED, Finance, and the URIs. URC reports directly to UoB’s Executive Board, chaired by the\\nVice-Chancellor.\\nIn addition to recurrent funding available to RED and the URIs, a substantial (c£2m) discretionary\\nStrategic Research Fund is available to the PVC-R&E and URC for investment in research\\ninitiatives. Significant additional, discipline-specific, financial and administrative support for\\nresearch is provided more locally by Faculties and Schools, as detailed in the UoA submissions. All\\nFaculties and Schools have their own Research Directors and Research Committees, along with\\ndedicated Impact Directors or equivalent.\\n  2. Strategy\\nUoB intends to build on its position as one of the world’s leading research-intensive universities, to\\nbe exemplary in its approach to collaboration, and to be a beacon of good practice in innovation,\\nimpact and integrity. We have had considerable success delivering the goals outlined in our\\nresearch strategies (2009-16, 2017-23). Interdisciplinary research has been enhanced;\\nengagement and collaboration with external partners of all kinds (academic, business and\\ncommunity; regional, national and international) has increased substantially; impact, engagement\\nand knowledge exchange (KE) have been embedded in our culture, as has Open Research;\\nsignificant progress has been made in developing a more diverse and inclusive workforce and\\neradicating the gender pay gap; support for the career development of colleagues, particularly\\nEarly Career Researchers (ECRs) and Postgraduate Researchers (PGRs), has been\\nstrengthened; Bristol Doctoral College (BDC) has been developed, which, together with our many\\nDoctoral Training Centres and Partnerships, has enhanced our PGRs’ research environment.\\nMain strategic priorities during REF period\\nDuring this REF period, particular strategic emphasis has been placed on:\\n        • fostering high quality multi- and inter-disciplinary research;\\n        • enhancing our external research engagements;\\n        • developing an infrastructure and culture to facilitate impact, engagement and KE;\\n        • ensuring all academic staff and PGRs can realise their research potential and that\\n           inclusivity and diversity are embedded in our academic culture.\\n     1) Fostering interdisciplinary research\\nTo encourage, foster and support multi- and inter-disciplinary research, UoB has invested in a\\nrange of University-wide, cross-disciplinary URIs. In 2014, we had two; there are now five:\\n         • Cabot Institute (Environment)\\n         • Elizabeth Blackwell Institute for Health Research\\n         • Brigstow Institute (Living well)\\n         • Jean Golding Institute (Data)\\n                                                                                                   Page 2\\n\\n\\n\\n         •   Bristol Digital Futures Institute\\nThe URIs have quickly become recognised flagships for UoB’s research, supporting a wide range\\nof cross-disciplinary projects and providing a springboard for larger collaborations and connections\\nbetween disciplines. Their leaderships and memberships draw on colleagues from across UoB.\\nThe URIs are supplemented by seven funded Specialist Research Institutes (SRIs), which foster\\nthe growth of, and give greater external visibility to, UoB’s internationally acknowledged, world-\\nleading research in these areas:\\n         •   Bristol BioDesign Institute\\n         •   Bristol Composites Institute\\n         •   Bristol Heart Institute\\n         •   Migration Mobilities Bristol\\n         •   Bristol Population Health Science Institute\\n         •   Bristol Poverty Institute\\n         •   Bristol Quantum Information Institute\\nThe disciplinary diversity of UoB and its ability to mobilise high-quality interdisciplinary research\\nactivity is exemplified by the composition of the UNCOVER and ReCOVer groups formed to\\nconduct pandemic-related research (see annex).\\n    2) Enhancing external engagement\\nUoB enjoys close relationships with many business, governmental and civil society organisations.\\nWe work closely with WECA, supported the development of the Local Industrial Strategy, and co-\\ndeveloped the 2017 South West England and South East Wales Science and Innovation Audit for\\nBEIS. We are now working with the Western Gateway on its plans to create an ‘economic\\npowerhouse’ between the West and Wales.\\nIn the business context, our focus has been on digital innovation, advanced manufacturing,\\naerospace, quantum technologies and life sciences. UoB hosts the National Composites Centre\\n(turnover £30m pa; capital assets over £100m) and has a growing number of major strategic\\nbusiness partners (including Airbus, Rolls Royce, BT, LV=GI, Thales, Toshiba). TQEC’s\\ndevelopment in the city’s enterprise zone is a catalyst for strengthening existing partnerships and\\ndeveloping new ones. Many business partners are major investors in our research. The Bristol\\nregion hosts one of the UK’s most successful high-tech regional economies and a globally\\nsignificant digital technology cluster. In addition to providing these industries with new talent and\\ninnovation support, UoB has played a key role in Bristol’s rapidly developing innovation ecosystem.\\nUoB is 5th for investment in UK spinouts and 1st outside London and Oxbridge; 50 new spinout\\ncompanies were formed during this REF period, and our spinouts currently employ 600 people.\\nThese services are supported through various enterprise spaces, such as SETsquared, ES and\\nUnit DX. UoB was a founding partner of SETsquared, an innovation and enterprise collaboration\\nwith Bath, Southampton and Surrey, with Exeter joining during this REF period. In 2019, it was\\nranked Global no.1 University Business Incubator by UBI Global for the third consecutive time.\\nSETsquared Bristol currently supports over 80 technology companies employing over 1000 people.\\nES, founded by UoB in collaboration with BCC and the Local Enterprise Partnership, provides\\nspace in which businesses, entrepreneurs, academics, social innovators and community\\n                                                                                                  Page 3\\n\\n\\n\\norganisations can collaborate. By 2019 ES had worked with over 60 partners. Unit DX is a deep-\\ntech incubator created by the award-winning UoB start-up Ziylo (acquired in 2018 for $800m by a\\nglobal heathcare company).\\nUoB is committed to contributing to the economic regeneration of the less privileged parts of the\\ncity and to working with Bristol’s vibrant civil society sector. UoB has senior representatives on\\nmany civic fora and has close links with BCC and a large number of community, heritage and\\ncreative arts organisations, schools, and small businesses, actively encouraging co-produced\\nresearch projects. It has established an Inclusive Economy Initiative and is involved in more than\\n20 co-produced projects with BCC on the local economy, environment, digital connectivity and\\nhealth. A City Fellows project is currently providing six NGO and Council staff with the opportunity\\nto co-produce research.\\nEnvironmental sustainability is a key pillar of our vision. In 2015, we helped Bristol become the first\\nUK city to secure European Green Capital status and we are a founding member of Bristol Green\\nCapital Partnership. UoB and UWE Bristol were the first UK HEIs to commit to the Sustainable\\nDevelopment Goals Accord launched in 2017; we were the first UK University to declare a climate\\nemergency. We are working with BCC to embed environmental sustainability in the One City Plan,\\nthe overarching strategy document for the City. UoB is also a founding member of Bristol Health\\nPartners and is now one of only eight Academic Health Science Centres (AHSCs) in the UK. The\\nspirit of partnership extends to many other Universities and organisations such as GCHQ, the Alan\\nTuring Institute, the Met Office, the Heilbronn Institute, and the NHS. We also have an NIHR\\nBiomedical Research Centre and are the only University with membership of all three NIHR\\nSchools (Primary Care Research, Public Health Research, and Social Care Research).\\nAs well as many external links developed by individual Schools, URIs and SRIs, and other\\nresearch groups, UoB has a growing number of international partnerships. We are also a member\\nof the GW4 Alliance with Bath, Cardiff and Exeter. GW4 has been instrumental in facilitating many\\ncollaborative Centres for Doctoral Training.\\nExternal engagement will lie at the heart of UoB’s new campus. TQEC, scheduled to open in 2023,\\naims to be at the forefront of digital and business education and research innovation, and has\\nalready secured substantial funding, engaging a wide range of business and community partners:\\n         •   Bristol Digital Futures Institute is supported by a £100m award: £29m from the\\n             Research Partnership Investment Fund supplemented by £71m from 27 business\\n             partners including BT, Dyson, BBC, Airbus and Aardman.\\n         •   The Quantum Technologies Innovation Centre (QTIC+) is supported by £35m from\\n             WECA for the development and commercialisation of quantum and emergent\\n             technologies.\\n         •   MyWorld recently received a £46m UKRI Strength in Places award and, building on the\\n             city-region’s strengths in media production and technology, is connecting regional and\\n             national partners with global tech giants such as Netflix, Google and Microsoft, and\\n             pioneering new digital formats and technologies.\\n    3) Impact, engagement and KE infrastructure\\nThrough RED, UoB has developed a culture and infrastructure that facilitates and supports co-\\nproduced research and external impact, engagement and KE.\\n                                                                                                Page 4\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RED Partnerships team provides guidance and practical advice on partnership development.\\nIn 2018, a Partnerships and Alliance portal was launched, providing sector-leading best practice\\nsupport for engagement, collaboration and partnering. Other teams provide professional expertise\\nin stakeholder mapping, market analysis, community and civic engagement. PolicyBristol advises\\ncolleagues on working with policy-makers, increasing the external reach of their research at the\\nlocal, national and international levels. RED’s KE team manages the devolved funding for impact\\nfrom the Research Councils and Wellcome Trust, and to date has secured more than £36m in\\ncollaborative funding. The team supports translational funding bids and works closely with\\ncolleagues on the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) and Industrial Strategy Challenge\\nFund opportunities. Research commercialization is supported by another dedicated team, advising\\non the creation of IP, licensing, and spinouts.\\nUoB has one of the longest established public engagement teams in the UK, working in the last\\nfive years with partners from 23 countries as well as organisations such as We the Curious, SS\\nGreat Britain, and the Natural History Consortium. Along with UWE Bristol, we co-host the National\\nCo-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement.\\nUoB’s International Strategic Fund helps researchers develop sustainable international research\\npartnerships. Since 2016, we have secured over £32m from the GCRF, and our GCRF strategy\\nwas one of 10 (from 107) commended by Research England as a benchmark for best practice.\\n    4) Realising staff potential and embedding diversity and inclusion\\nSee ‘People’ section.\\nResearch Ethics\\nUoB promotes the highest standards of ethical, scholarly and professional integrity, fully endorsing\\nthe Commitments of the Concordat to Support Research Integrity. A framework of policies,\\nregulations and guidance has been developed, including an Ethics of Research Policy and\\nProcedure and a Research Governance and Integrity Policy. The six Faculty Ethics Committees\\nreport to a University-wide Ethics of Research Committee chaired by a PVC. Training programmes\\npromote awareness and embed ethical principles across our research community.\\nUoB played a leading role in the UK Reproducibility Network and in March 2020 launched a Centre\\nfor Research Quality and Improvement, supported by philanthropic donation. In 2019 a Research\\nImprovement Group was established, tasked with enhancing research integrity across all Faculties.\\nAs a signatory to the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) we have adopted a\\nresponsible approach to the use of metrics in research management and assessment, developing\\na set of institutional principles that underpin the use of metrics and indicators in our internal\\nplanning processes and revised promotions framework.\\nOpen Research\\nWe have established an institutional Policy on Open Access to Research Publications to mandate\\nopen access publishing. University policies for access to block grants from UKRI and the Charity\\nOpen Access Fund have favoured ECRs and PGRs.\\n                                                                                                  Page 5\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Research Data Management and Open Data Policy provides guidance on responsibilities\\nassociated with managing and preserving current or future research data and software. A publicly\\naccessible Research Data Repository for datasets, and a sector-leading Research Data Service,\\nworking with the Jean Golding URI, helps researchers plan, manage and share research data. We\\nhave committed to the Concordat on Open Research Data principles, promoting and implementing\\nthese through the above groups/committees/services – for example, by including Open Research\\nas a criterion in revised promotions procedures.\\nFuture Plans\\nUoB will continue to support high-quality research, fundamental and applied, across all disciplines.\\nThe promotion of interdisciplinarity and development of the URIs and SRIs will remain a high\\npriority, as will the deepening of relationships with external partners. We intend to grow and\\ndiversify our research income portfolio and enhance our responsiveness to research users’ needs.\\nDespite the financial effects of the pandemic, our plans for further investments in academic staff,\\nphysical and research infrastructure remain in place, though some timelines are likely to be\\nextended. Investment in TQEC has already begun, with an initial planned investment of c£500m.\\nTQEC is already strengthening our relationships with businesses, government and local\\norganisations, many of which will be co-located on the campus. All will have access to our\\nresearch expertise and be able to work with us to tackle the issues concerning them.\\nWe are committed to investing: £12m on a National Soil-Foundation-Structure Interaction\\nLaboratory; £14m on a new Dental School; and further investments in our Humanities Centre. Our\\nAdvanced Computing Research Centre Strategy commits £2m per annum for the next 10 years to\\nmeet the increasing demands of AI, big data and simulation resources across UoB. An £8m\\ninvestment in a cardiac research facility is also planned alongside a future £100m investment in a\\nnew University library and special collections exhibition space on the main campus.\\nAn annual Strategic Research Fund (about £2m and growing) has been established to support\\nstrategic research initiatives, capacity-build in areas of emerging research excellence, respond to\\nglobal challenges, and develop relationships with funders and policy-makers in the public, private\\nand third sectors.\\n  3. People\\nWe recruit and retain scholars of the highest quality by providing an intellectually open, vibrant and\\ncollegiate research environment, ensuring all academic staff realise their full potential regardless of\\ncareer-stage, FTE, and balance of research and teaching responsibilities. Staff surveys are\\nconducted annually to canvass views and ensure that decision-making is well-informed. In 2019,\\nUoB was one of only ten UK universities to retain its HR Excellence in Research Award.\\nStudy Leave, SSRs and Workloads\\nTo ensure working conditions conducive to high-quality research are preserved, we strive to\\nmaintain good student-staff ratios (SSRs) benchmarked against RG medians. Common principles\\non the equitable allocation of workloads have been developed, under which 40% of the time of\\nTeaching & Research colleagues is normally dedicated to research. Provision for research/study\\nleave is devolved to Schools.\\n                                                                                                Page 6\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring this REF period the promotions criteria and procedures have been comprehensively revised\\nto recognise the full range of research contributions and take proper account of external\\nengagement, impact-oriented research and work crossing disciplinary boundaries. They also seek\\nto eliminate gender and ethnic disadvantage.\\nECRs\\nWe ensure that ECRs are well-mentored and advised on career development. Much of this work is\\nundertaken at School level, augmented by wider networks and supports at Faculty and University\\nlevels. UoB’s CREATE scheme (Cultivating REsearch And Teaching Excellence) offers a wide\\nrange of professional development programmes, enabling staff to enhance their teaching and\\nresearch practices and gain national recognition with Advance HE, aligned to the UK Professional\\nStandards Framework. CREATE programmes are available to all academics, including PGRs who\\nteach. A range of ECR networks have been established to develop peer-mentoring.\\nPost-Doctoral Fellows\\nIn 2016, UoB created Vice-Chancellor’s Fellowships for post-doctoral, early- and mid-career\\nresearchers, offering salaries, mentoring and a bespoke programme of cohort-focussed\\ndevelopment activity. VC Fellows have: secured major grants (including an EPSRC New\\nInvestigator Award); engaged local communities (securing access to a share of £33m to support\\nsocial enterprises tackling inequality); and delivered commercial collaborations (Community Energy\\nEngland Collaboration Award). Eight Fellows have secured permanent Lectureships, two have\\nbeen awarded prestigious Henry Dale Fellowships, and one a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship.\\nPGRs\\nUoB has one of the UK’s largest concentrations of funding and support for PhD training, leading on\\n28 funded centres and partnerships. We were, for example, awarded nine EPSRC CDTs (highest\\nnumber across the UK), and the Social Science SWDTP (partners: Bath, Exeter, Plymouth, UWE)\\nhas the joint largest allocation of funded PhD places.\\nSupport for PGRs is led by an Associate PVC-R (PGR) and by BDC. In their 2016 review of the\\nUniversity, the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education highlighted, as an example of good\\npractice, BDC’s personal and professional development programme of workshops, seminars and\\nonline resources (open to all PGRs). BDC led the creation of a PGR hub with training and\\ncollaborative spaces, runs an annual Research without Borders Festival of Postgraduate Research\\nand an annual Doctoral Teacher Symposium. It operates a PGR Ventures Fund to encourage\\ninnovation, creativity and leadership; it also spearheads the development of international and\\nindustrial PhDs, operating a new Industrial PhD Placement scheme funded by EPSRC’s National\\nProductivity Investment Fund.\\nResearch-focussed Staff\\nUoB is an active member of Researchers14, regularly serving on the national awarding panel and\\nacting as an external reviewing body, and was one of the first universities to sign the new\\nConcordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers (working with other research-\\nintensive universities on the Concordat review).\\nIn 2018 Bristol Clear was launched to offer career guidance for researchers, providing a range of\\ntailored resources including a mentoring scheme and information about careers and opportunities\\n                                                                                             Page 7\\n\\n\\n\\nat UoB and elsewhere. We have also invested in research-focused technical staff and are a lead\\nsignatory to the National Technician Commitment. A Research Staff Working Party (RSWP)\\nreports to the University HR Committee and URC, and a Research Staff Reps Committee\\nrepresents research staff on a range of University bodies including RSWP.\\nEquality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI)\\nOur University Strategy includes firm commitments to EDI. Our goals are greater staff and student\\nengagement, enhanced staff and student experience, and culture change. In 2019 an EDI Delivery\\nPlan was launched (part of a University-wide People Plan) to build a more diverse and inclusive\\nUniversity community. Governance has been overhauled. An EDI Oversight Group has been\\nestablished, chaired by a member of the Board of Trustees, and different members of the\\nexecutive team given responsibility for different EDI areas, with the DVC/Provost acting as overall\\nEDI champion. Each Faculty has established an EDI Committee and most Schools have active EDI\\nGroups. In 2018 UoB helped shape Bristol’s Equality Charter, a city-wide initiative co-designed by\\nprivate, public and voluntary sector organisations. We became a member of the Race Equality\\nCharter in 2019 and are also members of the Employers’ Initiative on Domestic Abuse and the\\nBusiness Disability Forum. We continue to hold an Athena SWAN Bronze Award and, at School\\nlevel, hold nine Bronze and six Silver awards. We expect all Schools to have achieved at least a\\nBronze award by 2023. The DVC and two of five PVCs are female, as are three of the five URI\\nDirectors; of the six Faculties two have female Deans and four have female FRDs.\\nStaff Networks provide peer support across UoB, each sponsored by Executive Team members\\nwho meet regularly with staff. These Networks include Parents and Carers, BAME, Disabled, Staff\\nWho Stammer, LGBT+, and Childless. Our TheirStories programme, which uses personal\\nstorytelling from staff as a vehicle for building workplace inclusion, improving employee\\nengagement, challenging bias and developing a culture of belonging, won the national Universities\\nHR award for initiatives that improved EDI. EDI training forms part of essential training for all staff.\\nWe are developing an approach to staff development that helps colleagues understand how their\\nown behaviours and attitudes influence our EDI culture. A newly-developed programme\\nencompassing unconscious bias, microaggressions and active bystander techniques has been\\nintroduced as part of our Stand Up, Speak Out initiative. A programme on anti-racism has been\\nlaunched and we have expanded our Acceptable Behaviour Supporters service, providing informal\\nadvice to staff experiencing unacceptable behaviour, bullying or harassment. There is an online\\nReport/Support tool to track anonymous complaints.\\nIn early 2019 we published an institutional statement on race equality and publicly committed to\\nintensifying our efforts to address racism. We have since established an Anti-Racism Steering\\nGroup, co-chaired by the DVC/Provost and Head of Research Development (UK), to develop\\nstrategies to address individual, cultural and structural racism. As a member of Bristol’s Race\\nEquality Strategic Leaders Group, UoB works with public sector organisations in a city-wide\\napproach to tackle race equality issues. We ensure that significant changes and improvements are\\ndelivered through partnership initiatives, sharing learning, resources and good practice. To reduce\\ninequalities in accessing PGR training, we have instituted a £200k pilot, Opportunity Bristol,\\ntargeted at black and black-heritage PGRs.\\nUoB is a member of the Stonewall Diversity Champions programme. Our Stonewall Steering\\nGroup, comprising members of the senior team and the LGBT+ staff and student networks,\\n                                                                                                 Page 8\\n\\n\\n\\nidentifies actions to advance LGBT+ equality. We annually sponsor and participate in Bristol Pride\\nand were named Best Employer in the 2016 Bristol Pride Awards. Rainbow lanyards are now\\ncommonplace across our campus. In 2019, we launched an LGBT+ Supporters programme and\\nhave reviewed all HR policies to ensure gender neutral terminology is used and same-sex couples\\nincluded. A four-year programme to refurbish facilities across the campus, including increasing the\\nnumber of gender-neutral toilets, is underway.\\nDisability Access Statements for our buildings have been developed, and Inclusive Design\\nPrinciples introduced by Campus/Estates Division, who consult with our Disabled Staff Network\\nfrom the earliest stages of design. We also provide web-based guidance on reasonable\\nadjustments and briefing sessions on supporting disabled staff for HR Operations staff and\\nmanagers. The government’s Access to Work and the Mental Health Wellbeing Service have been\\npromoted. An International Adviser role has been established within HR to offer online relocation\\nsupport and ensure new colleagues from abroad are helped to settle in the UK.\\nIn response to the pandemic, we have created an EDI Resources Hub for marginalised\\ncommunities disproportionately affected because of existing inequalities. We have worked hard to\\nprovide reasonable adjustments to staff working at home, including the provision of specialist\\nequipment such as desks or chairs (see annex).\\nGender Pay Gap\\nUoB’s 2016 Strategy targeted eliminating the gender pay gap (to within +/-3%) in the professoriate\\nby 2023. By November 2019, we had achieved a 2-percentage-point reduction in the professorial\\ngender pay gap to 5.5% and had narrowly surpassed the 2019/20 target of 28% female professors.\\nIn January 2020, the University and local UCU branch signed a collective agreement, the first of its\\nkind in UK Higher Education, to eliminate the gender pay gap among academic staff over the next\\nthree years. A detailed analysis of gender employment and pay at the University was undertaken in\\n2018 and an inaugural Gender Pay Gap Report published, resulting in actions focused on three\\nareas: flexible working, career development, and promotion.\\nAn enhanced package of family-friendly measures for carers has been developed and our Women\\nReturners’ Scheme relaunched as a Returning Carers’ Scheme, offering more inclusive support to\\nstaff seeking to re-establish their research following extended leave due to caring responsibilities.\\nChildcare is now recognised as an allowable expense that can be reclaimed to facilitate\\nconference/training attendance, a Women’s Mentoring Network has been established and a\\nFemale Leadership Initiative launched. The work to eliminate the gender pay gap is being\\nmanaged by a change initiative (the Academic Career Development Programme) running between\\n2020-22. This programme is gathering data on part-time working patterns, monitoring the gender\\npay gap, and identifying actions with timescales. Work has also been undertaken to tackle possible\\ncultural biases in shortlisting by recruitment and promotion panels.\\nAll job adverts across the University now include the ‘Happy to talk flexible working’ logo from the\\nwork-life balance charity, Working Families. There will be an equal pay audit in 2020/21.\\nEthnicity Pay Gap\\nUoB is committed to addressing the ethnicity pay gap and improving the representation of BAME\\nstaff.

A Special\\nInterest Group has been formed, populated by UCU representatives and senior University\\nmanagers, to agree actions, set appropriate targets, and introduce greater security to staff on\\nexisting casual contracts. A University-wide Action Plan is being developed and guidance and\\nresources provided to Faculties and Schools.\\nEDI and REF\\nEDI issues were taken into account at all stages of our REF processes. Our Code of Practice\\npromotes inclusivity and recognises the diversity of our staff, as well as ensuring compliance with\\nequality and employment legislation. The Code applies to all staff, including contract research staff\\nand those on fixed-term or part-time contracts.\\nAll individuals involved in decision-making received mandatory EDI training. Outputs proposed by\\nstaff were subjected to a rigorous review process based on the REF criteria. When selecting\\nbetween and allocating outputs of equal starred quality, account was taken of the spread of outputs\\nacross individual members of staff and their protected characteristics. A REF2021 Staff\\nCircumstances Panel was convened and eligible staff invited to submit an online form disclosing\\nequality-related circumstances. To mitigate the risks of bias, all cases were considered\\nanonymously, with decisions ratified by URC.\\nIndicators\\n 1) Recruitment by age profile\\n736 staff (47% of 1571 headcount) within our REF submission joined (or re-joined) UoB between\\n01/08/2013 and 31/07/2020.\\nAge                  Number of staff\\n20-29                25\\n30-39                398\\n40-49                201\\n50-59                86\\n60-69                23\\n70-79                3\\nTotal                736\\n                                                                                             Page 10\\n\\n\\n\\n 2) Professors and senior staff by protected characteristics (where data held)\\n  Gender                 Number of staff                Ethnicity               Number of staff\\n  Female                 147                            Asian                   24\\n  Male                   387                            Black                   1\\n  Total                  534                            Mixed                   6\\n                                                        Not Known/Blank         9\\n  Disability             Number of staff                Other                   6\\n  Disability             30                             Prefer not to say       22\\n  No Disability          504                            White                   466\\n  Total                  534                            Total                   534\\n 3) Average (mean and median) institutional gender pay gap for academic staff in 2019\\nThe institutional gender pay gap for all academics at 31/03/19 was 8.4% median and 12.2% mean\\nin favour of staff who disclose as male.\\n  4.

Industry income has grown sharply: UoB had the 4th highest level of\\nabsolute growth in the RG between 17/18 and 18/19 [HESA].\\nCentral Support for Research: Research & Enterprise Development (RED)\\nComprehensive support for research is provided at University, Faculty and School levels. Centrally,\\nsupport is provided by RED, organised in teams to which all Faculties have access: research\\ndevelopment; research policy; research governance; contracts; partnerships and programmes.\\nRED provides support for all aspects of research: horizon-scanning; identifying funding\\nopportunities; application preparation; engagement, KE and impact; external partnership\\ndevelopment; research and consultancy contracts; compliance; commercialisation. Many of RED’s\\nteams have Faculty-aligned roles to provide bespoke support for research development, impact\\ndevelopment, innovation and commercialisation.\\nFinancial Support\\nFinancial support is also provided at all levels. Central support comes from the PVC-R&E and\\nURC, with the Strategic Research Fund pump-priming institutional strategic research initiatives. A\\nfurther fund is available to URC for distribution to support key Faculty and School initiatives. An\\nInternational Strategic Fund supports the establishment and development of sustainable\\ninternational research partnerships. These central funding sources are supplemented by research\\nfunds administered at Faculty and School levels.\\nInvestments in Infrastructure and Facilities\\nSignificant investments in physical research infrastructure have been made as part of the\\nUniversity's 10-year (2010-20) £525m capital investment programme.

      "[\"University of Dundee\\n  1. Context and mission\\nThe University of Dundee is a medium-sized civic institution with a compact and thriving city\\ncampus and a University hospital. The University received its Royal Charter in 1967 and its origins\\ndate back to 1881. Through collaborations and mergers, the University has evolved into a multi-\\ndisciplinary institution spanning medical, health and life sciences, engineering and physical\\nsciences, social sciences, humanities, art and design.\\nThe University’s core purpose is to transform lives locally and globally through the creation,\\nsharing and application of knowledge. In 2012, we codified our 25-year vision, entitled\\nTransforming Lives, seeking to become world-leading in our priority areas. Phased in five-year\\nimplementation plans, the current Strategy to 2022 emphasises the mutuality of our research,\\nteaching, and knowledge exchange endeavours (Figure 1). Its central pursuit is the creation of a\\nhigh-performance community defined by excellence, integrity, valuing people, working together\\nand making a difference. We achieve scale and amplify impact by organising around four\\ninterdisciplinary themes - Health and Wellbeing, Creativity and Design, Innovating Technology\\nand Social Justice – all congruent with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.\\nOur commitment to translational research through industry partnerships, especially in both basic\\nand applied biomedical research, has earned us recognition as one of Europe’s most innovative\\nuniversities. We are known for major technological breakthroughs from keyhole surgery to space\\ntechnology, health informatics, new treatments for neglected tropical diseases and design-led\\ninnovation. In 2014, we received our third Queen’s Anniversary Prize for excellence in forensic\\nanthropology and victim identification. We are globally connected and a member of the European\\nUniversities Association whilst locally anchored in the regional growth agenda and being pivotal in\\nbringing the V&A Museum of Design to Dundee.\\nOur 3,280 staff include a research community of 461 Category A FTE and 667 research staff,\\ncomplemented by c. 770 postgraduate researchers (PGRs). Restructuring four Colleges into 10\\nacademic Schools in 2015 has created greater internal connectivity. Schools are the academic\\nengines of the institution with considerable autonomy but porous boundaries promoting cross-\\nSchool collaboration. School research strategies are led by Associate Deans for Research (ADRs)\\ncombining with Impact Champions, Directors of Doctoral Studies and Research Integrity Leads, all\\nbenefitting from a centrally resourced Research and Innovation Service (RIS) and other\\nDirectorates supporting research. University research strategy is led by the Vice Principal for\\nResearch, Knowledge Exchange and Wider Impact (VPR) who sits on the University Executive\\nGroup and Chairs the University Research and KE Committee (URKEC), which meets five times\\nper year and reports to the Senate.\\n                                                                                              Page 1\\n\\n\\n     Figure 1: Visualisation of the Strategy to 2022 integrating research, knowledge exchange\\n               and impact endeavour throughout the institutional mission\\n  2. Strategy\\nThe University’s Strategy to 2022 sets out five strategic priorities across the research, KE and\\nwider impact continuum. These have driven activities within the current assessment period and will\\ninform the next five-year plan to 2027.\\nPriority 1: Build on research excellence to enhance performance and reputation\\nWe are committed to enabling all our 16 UoAs submitted to REF2021 to deliver world-leading\\nresearch and impact. We were ranked in the World top 100 for research quality (Nature Index,\\n2019) and 14th in the world for the proportion of publications per FTE achieving citation rates in the\\ntop 1% of their field (CWTS Leiden Ranking 2020). Excellence and critical mass is gained by\\ntargeted investment and promoting interdisciplinary themes and external partnerships.\\nAn Annual Research Review (ARR) was introduced in 2016 to ensure transparent and consistent\\nmanagement of research excellence across the University. School-based ARR panels evaluate\\noutput and impact quality, funding profiles, PGR supervision, engagement and esteem indicators.\\n                                                                                              Page 2\\n\\n\\nDiscipline-specific benchmarks are used in line with the Declaration on Research Assessment\\n(DORA) to which we are signatories. Developmental feedback is given to all staff whether\\nsupporting promotion processes or prompting support interventions.\\nTargeted investment in our Baxter Fellowships Programme (2019) enabled 18 outstanding early-\\ncareer researchers to be appointed across eight UoAs - according to growth, capacity-building and\\nregeneration criteria. This programme is trialling the creation of a fast-track academic cohort, who\\nwith augmented support and mentoring, are expected to achieve promotion to Reader or Chair\\nlevel within 10 years.\\nPriority 2: Embedding interdisciplinarity – promoting a vibrant research culture\\nAll Schools are research active and contribute to one or more UoAs. Our flat structure and\\ncompact campus promote a OneDundee approach of shared commitment to triple-intensity\\nacross research, teaching and engagement. Embedding interdisciplinarity brings together\\ncomplementary perspectives orientated to real-world thematic challenges, viz:\\n    •   Understanding and improving health and well-being;\\n    •   Life-enhancing creativity and design;\\n    •   Innovating technological solutions to tomorrow’s problems;\\n    •   Promoting social change to enhance diversity, justice and socio-economic prosperity.\\n     Figure 2: Composition, size and relationships of UoAs submitted to REF2021, mapped\\n                against University’s interdisciplinary themes\\n                                                                                               Page 3\\n\\n\\nOur research portfolio maps across these themes, with UoAs leading in their respective domain\\nareas and always alert to collaborative opportunities across the University (Figure 2). Promoting\\nsynergies across disciplines has yielded numerous exciting new collaborations, such as:\\n    •    Significant expansion of translational and interdisciplinary research, particularly in\\n         neglected disease drug discovery, exemplified by the opening of the Discovery Centre for\\n         Translational and Interdisciplinary Research in 2014. This in turn enabled the creation of\\n         the Wellcome Centre for Anti-Infectives Research (WCAIR) in 2017 (£13.6 million).\\n    •    The Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science since 2015 (£10 million) has\\n         stimulated collaboration across four Schools, and attracted further investment of £15 million\\n         through the Tay Cities Deal.\\nWe launched the Dundee Interdisciplinary and Innovation Forum in 2017 seeking to\\nmainstream enterprise across the University. DIIF hosts 10-16 events with 300–450 participants\\nper year, which facilitate trust, confidence and formation of new consortia. An early exemplar of\\nthis approach is the AHRC-funded InGAME (Innovation for Games and Media Enterprise)\\nconsortium (£11.5 million, 2018-2023) centred on the Dundee computer games cluster forging a\\nnew template for UK-wide games sector innovation. Greater critical mass has also been achieved\\nthrough new cross-unit research fora, such as the Arts and Humanities Research Institute\\n(UoAs 27, 28, 30) and the Institute of Social Science Research (UoAs 3, 4, 14, 17, 18, 20, 23)\\nwith funded seminars, international scholars exchange, pump-priming funding and an Annual\\nResearch Forum. Reflecting our commitment to policy engagement nearly a fifth (18.5%) of our\\noutputs for REF2021 are co-authored with corporate, government or professional bodies.\\nPriority 3: Embracing a One Dundee approach – strengthening partnerships\\nWe are strengthening our research portfolio through success with programme grants and\\ncollaborative projects. Engagement with Scottish Funding Council Research Pools, Innovation\\nCentres and UK Catapults supported capital investment in facilities such as the National\\nPhenotypic Screening Centre (NPSC) built on extant collaborations between the Scottish\\nUniversities Life Sciences Alliance (SULSA) and the University of Oxford.\\nWe are committed to fostering an open research environment through increased advocacy, and\\ncentralised support for all staff, including PGRs. Our Open Research Policy ensures that all\\noutputs, datasets and PGR theses are open access via the Discovery Portal, the University’s\\nonline Research Information System. We promote the accessibility of outputs through dedicated\\nsocial media channels, embedding training, skills, and KE through information sessions\\ncomplementing annual Open Access Week events. Data management is key to the open research\\npolicy, guided by compliance with the Concordat for Open Research Data, centrally supported\\nwith tailored storage solutions and advice underpinned by the University’s Policy to Govern the\\nManagement of Research Data.\\nIntegrity is one of the University’s core values, and we are guided by the principles of the\\nConcordat to Support Research Integrity with oversight by the Research Governance and\\nPolicy Sub-Committee. We have developed online research integrity training, which is mandatory\\nfor PGRs and new supervisors and since 2016 has been licensed across the sector. Research\\nIntegrity Leads have been appointed in all Schools with Deputy Leads and a network of Research\\nIntegrity Advisors in larger Schools. In 2019, we co-founded the Scottish Research Integrity\\nNetwork and, in 2020, hosted one of five Wellcome Trust ‘Re-imagine Research Culture’ events.\\n                                                                                                Page 4\\n\\n\\nPriority 4: Advance our Values – enhancing engagement through knowledge exchange\\nWe aim to grow our global reputation for innovative translational research as the world’s most\\ninfluential scientific research institution in pharmaceuticals (Clarivate Analytics 2017), and 5th in\\nthe UK for turning research into world-changing companies (Octopus Ventures 2020). We achieve\\nthis by nurturing a culture of innovation, invention, IP protection, licensing and investment in spin-\\nout companies, such as Exscientia Ltd, an internationally significant high-growth spinout. An\\nexemplar of our approach to synergising discovery research and translational partnerships is the\\nDrug Discovery Unit (DDU), a unique facility akin to a biotech company within a university, helping\\nto treat neglected diseases such as malaria and visceral leishmaniasis.\\nWidely regarded as a model of academic-industry collaboration, the Division of Signal\\nTransduction Therapy (DSTT) within the MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit\\n(PPU), has thrived for over 20 years. In this time, it has attracted over £65 million of investment\\nand helped develop dozens of drugs for clinical use, including cancer and Parkinson's Disease.\\nThis innovation culture is fostering new advances, such as entirely new modalities of therapeutics\\nbased on PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACS) through a significant and expanding\\ncollaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, the world’s largest private family-owned pharmaceutical\\ncompany.\\nOver the latest REF period, the University achieved commercialisation income (licencing and trade\\nsales of spinouts) of £14.4 million, raised £100 million of investment in our spinout portfolio,\\ncreated four new spinouts, three staff and 27 student start-ups and agreed 57 licence deals. The\\nestablishment of a dedicated Centre for Entrepreneurship in 2016 embedded a culture of\\nentrepreneurship by providing staff and PGRs with training and access to the first Scottish\\nuniversity-based business accelerator programme. It has seed-funded five research staff and 13\\nPGR ventures whilst developing skills of 100+ staff and students every year through the eight-\\nweek extra-curricular Enterprise Challenge programme.\\nPriority 5: Intensify our impact locally and globally through wider engagement\\nThe University is anchored in the Dundee city-region driving over £740 million a year of economic\\nimpact and supporting 1 in every 12 jobs in Tayside with our activities. This priority positions the\\nUniversity as an agent of transformation, locally and globally, contributing to prosperity and\\nwellbeing, maximising cultural, societal and economic benefits.\\nWe are aligned to the Research to Recovery ambitions of the UK R&D Roadmap by connecting\\nlocal strengths to global opportunities. This includes delivering on the £40 million investment won\\nthrough the Tay Cities Deal to create a Biomedical Innovation Hub enabling a step change in\\ninnovation-led growth in the regional economy through new spinout companies, job creation and\\ninward investment in the biotech and medtech sectors. This will be complemented by JustTech, the\\nworld’s first innovation hub for forensic science, creating a new growth sector enabling reliable\\nscience to be used in the delivery of justice worldwide. Finally, we will continue our long-term\\nstrategic partnership with the James Hutton Institute, one of the UK’s largest land-based research\\nfacilities, where our Division of Plant Sciences is co-located, which will see us engaged with the\\nestablishment of a world-leading International Barley Hub and Advanced Vertical Plant Growth\\nCentre (£62 million), tackling food security and contributing to the Net Zero agenda.\\nThe V&A Museum of Design opened in 2018 as the centrepiece of a £1 billion waterfront\\nredevelopment in Dundee, the UK’s only UNESCO City of Design. The University of Dundee was a\\nleading actor in bringing the V&A project to fruition, building on the long-standing reputation of our\\nleading School of Art and Design, and flagship programmes such as the AHRC KE Hub Design in\\n                                                                                                 Page 5\\n\\n\\nAction, (£5 million, 2012-2017). As founding partners in V&A Dundee we ensure continued\\nengagement through Board membership and joint curatorial and research-design manager\\nappointments. In 2020, we signed another strategic partnership agreement with the Dundee-based\\nMichelin Scotland Innovation Parc, endowed with £50 million investment funds promoting\\nbusinesses supporting sustainable mobility and pursuit of Net Zero.\\nIn relation to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals we ranked 20th worldwide in the\\ninaugural 2019 ‘THE Impact Rankings’ based on indicators reflecting research, outreach and\\nstewardship. We were recipients of the UN’s Risk Award 2019 for the impact achieved in\\nadvancing flood-resilient floating homes in coastal Bangladesh through the Centre for Water Law,\\nPolicy and Science, the UK’s only Category 2 UNESCO Centre, and the only interdisciplinary\\nwater centre of its kind in the world. We hosted the WHO Oral Health and Craniofacial Anomalies\\nCollaborating Centre until 2018 and continue to inform WHO policy as an expert advisory partner.\\nOur global reach has been boosted by Global Challenges Research Funding (GCRF). We were\\nawarded a £ 7 million NIHR Global Health Unit in 2017 to set up a major UK-India clinical\\npartnership to combat diabetes. Our GCRF block grant enabled us to build capacity and\\npartnerships for future ODA-related research and supported 70 projects involving over 100\\nacademic staff from all 10 Schools working in 26 Low- and Middle-Income Countries. Our GCRF\\nblock grant enabled us to build capacity and partnerships for future ODA-related research and\\nsupported 70 projects, including Global Scholarships, exchanges and pilot projects, involving over\\n100 academic staff from all 10 Schools working in 26 Low- and Middle-Income Countries.\\n  3. People\\n3.1 Staffing Strategy – Enable our people to flourish\\nPeople are at the heart of the University Strategy’s to be a High-Performance Community (Figure\\n1). We aspire to attract, nurture and retain the brightest talent from across the globe and have\\ndesigned our research environment accordingly. The annual Objective Setting and Review (OSaR)\\nprocess is the centrepiece of our staff development process. It draws together multiple inputs,\\nincluding the ARR, enabling colleagues and line managers to evaluate contribution against the\\nexcellence agenda and inform personal development plans.\\nAcross most Schools new academic staff are appointed on a three-year probation contract, which\\nis made permanent (confirmed) with the demonstration of satisfactory progress. Reflecting\\nPrincipal Investigators and research group cultures in the Schools of Life Sciences and Medicine\\nboth employ an alternative five year ‘Fellowship-based’ tenure-track process. In all cases academic\\nand research staff are provided with clear objectives, resources, and support. All staff have access\\nto TRAM (Teaching, Research & Academic Mentoring Scheme) a cross-institutional mentoring\\nscheme established jointly by the Universities of Dundee and St Andrews 14 years ago whose\\nsuccess has grown to incorporate six HEIs.\\nThe University has a ‘Periodic Leave’ policy, which provides one semester for each three-year\\nperiod of service, subject to a maximum of one year’s leave on any one occasion. Recognition for\\nsustained contribution to the University’s research mission is considered through Annual Review\\n(Academic Promotion) and Merit Awards for professional services staff. Over the assessment\\nperiod, a TRAC-compliant Workload Allocation Model was introduced ensuring that all Teaching\\nand Research staff have at least 30% of protected research time.\\n                                                                                               Page 6\\n\\n\\nWe support the promotion and improvement of the health, safety and wellbeing of our staff and\\nstudents through a suite of University Work-Life Balance policies, procedures and guidance, which\\nare regularly reviewed. Flexible and remote working is institutionally supported and managed by\\nSchools involving tools such as a resilience package, sickness absence and ill health policies,\\ncarer’s leave and in-house occupational health support. We are committed to equal opportunities\\nfor staff on part-time and fixed-term contracts and provide relevant training and Careers Advice\\nService. Our fixed term compared to permanent staff contracts in the researcher category have\\ndecreased from 56% to 42% between 2014/15 and 2019/20. We engage Capita biennially to\\nsurvey levels of staff satisfaction biennially and most recently ranked 6th out of 31 HEIs as an\\nEmployer of Choice.\\n3.2 Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) – Advance our values\\nThe University’s commitment and advancement of EDI is inspired by our core purpose and values\\nframework, informed and supported by our Equality Outcomes Plan. We have focussed on the\\nProtected Characteristics of gender, race, disability and LGBT equality as recognised by Athena\\nSWAN awards achieved at both institutional and school levels (Institutional Bronze 2014 and\\n2017). We are a member of the Race Equality Charter and will submit for an award in July 2021.\\nWe have been a Stonewall Diversity Champion since 2016 and have evidenced significant\\nprogress in the benchmarking Stonewall Workplace Equality Index for LGBT inclusion in the\\nworkplace. Sharing experiences across these various networks is critical to progressing our\\nEquality Outcomes.\\nWe promote EDI by mandatory online training for all staff and by recording protected\\ncharacteristics as part of the recruitment, probation and promotion process. Our Dignity at Work\\nand Study policy codifies our commitment not to tolerate discrimination, harassment or bullying.\\nSupport is provided through our Harassment Advisers Network. The REF2021 Code of Practice\\nwas developed in accordance with the aims and objectives of the University’s Equality Outcomes\\nPlan 2017–2021 and SFC Outcome Agreement meeting the Public Sector Equality Duty.\\nConsistent with our REF Code of Practice bespoke training relating to unconscious bias was\\ndeveloped for all staff involved in REF management.\\n3.3 Early Career Researcher (ECR) Support – Grow & diversify our researcher community\\nReflecting our commitment to growing talent within the University, 22% of our Category A staff\\nmeet the REF definition of ECR. The University has held the HR Excellence in Research award\\nsince 2011 and our Year-8 renewal was achieved in February 2020. We recently signed the\\nrevised Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers and are compliant with\\nthe QAA Code of Practice for Research Degree Programmes. Implementation plans are driven\\nby the Career Development for Research Staff (CDRS) Steering Group, chaired by the VPR, which\\nincludes representatives from the Research Staff Association. Two dedicated development officers\\nsupport compliance with the Concordat and harmonise training and employability provision.\\nThe University endorses UKRI recommendations of the minimum number of 80 hours annually for\\ndevelopment activities. We are a member of Vitae, UKCGE and Advanced HE, which provides\\naccess to career support and broader experiences complementing the University’s Researcher\\nDevelopment Programme within the comprehensive programme provided by the Occupational &\\nProfessional Development (OPD) unit. The range of face-to-face and online training maps to\\nVitae’s Researcher Development Framework with excellent levels of uptake since 2016 from PGR\\n(almost 50%) and research staff (over 35%).\\n                                                                                               Page 7\\n\\n\\nBespoke careers training is available through our Careers Advice Services and wider development\\nopportunities are offered by Schools and Professional Services, as well as access to external\\nWriting Retreats, Vitae events and national programmes such as Voice of Young Science,\\nConverge Challenge, and the interdisciplinary Scottish Crucible. The QAA Enhancement-led\\nInstitutional Review (ELIR, 2018/19) commended support for the PGR experience through\\ninitiatives such as the Thesis Bootcamp.\\nThe University’s research degree programmes are underpinned by the Research Degree Quality\\nCode. This includes mandatory training and accreditation of research degree supervisors, and\\nmonitoring through structured annual programme reviews, enhanced by feedback from PGRs\\nthrough the Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES). All PGRs have a second\\nsupervisor and meet with a Thesis Monitoring Committee at least once every semester and have\\nopportunities and training for teaching and demonstrating duties. Support and representation\\nsystems are in place in partnership with the Dundee University Students Association (DUSA) to\\nensure effective student welfare and engagement with policy development.\\nWe have a large, diverse and vibrant community of PGRs, and host Doctoral Training\\nProgrammes (MRC, Wellcome), Partnerships (BBSRC, ESRC, AHRC) and Collaborative\\nCentres (EPSRC, NERC) as well recruiting top international talent through the China Scholarship\\nCouncil Programme. In 2018/19 we created a suite of new Doctorates in Professional Practice,\\npresently available in 8 out of 10 Schools, and began the ‘100 Projects’ campaign to enhance\\nquality and volume of PGR recruitment to the University’s interdisciplinary themes. We funded\\n‘Global Citizens’ Scholarships through our GCRF award. To build a more cohesive interdisciplinary\\nconnected community, increase PGR numbers and enhance the student experience, we\\nestablished a Doctoral Academy in 2019 coordinating all aspects of the research lifecycle of\\nPGRs and supervisory support. The investment has created designated offices and training space\\nand a secretariat (3.7 FTE) led by a professorial Academic Director.\\n  4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\nTo achieve our vision, we provide the infrastructure, physical, digital and human, for researchers to\\nachieve excellent research and innovation outcomes. It contributes to our institutional strategy\\n(Figure 1) and enables us to achieve our strategic research priorities to intensify our impact,\\nenhance our reputation and performance, enhancing our One Dundee approach.\\n4.1 Physical Infrastructure\\nThe University has world-class facilities, from laboratories to studios and exhibition space,\\narchives, collections and libraries. Capital investment of £30.6 million has increased access to\\nstate-of-the-art laboratory space across the institution since 2014. This includes £13 million to\\nupgrade the School of Art & Design studios and library and over £2 million investment in the main\\nLibrary and Learning Centre (LLC) for dedicated PGR space. Along with capital investment, both\\nlocations benefit from co-location of LLC and IT Services research support teams. The co-location\\nof physical, computational and biological sciences in the Discovery Centre (previous UK Research\\nPartnership Investment Fund) received further University capital investment of £3.1 million\\nexpanding capabilities in anti-infectives drug development. We have also generated significant\\nincome of £10.5 million from philanthropic donations enabling targeted infrastructure investment for\\nECRs in the Jacqui Woods Cancer Centre, to purchase magnetic resonance guided focused\\nultrasound (MRgFUS) technology treating essential tremor caused by neurological disease and for\\n                                                                                                Page 8\\n\\n\\nfacial reconstruction facilities based in the Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification supporting\\ncollaboration with forensic scientists and dentists.\\nOur specialist facilities and services are available to all staff and external users, exemplified by the\\nCentre for Advanced Scientific Technologies hosting cutting-edge technology platforms including\\nthe Dundee Imaging Facility, proteomics, microscopy, oligonucleotide synthesis, flow-cytometry\\nand X-ray crystallography, which has enabled our world-leading cell signalling and drug\\ndevelopment research and our biomedical and imaging research in engineering. The proteomics\\nplatform, for example, has been a key enabler of industrial partnerships (GSK, DSTT consortium,\\nBoehringer Ingelheim) and creation of one related spin-out company.\\n4.2 Digital Infrastructure\\nTo improve access for the internal and external research community, some facilities and areas of\\ntechnical support have been centralised, such as the High-Performance Computing facilities,\\nachieving more consistent technical support and enhancing technical staff retention and career\\ndevelopment. The Health Informatics Centre (HIC) specialises in health data linkage and is the first\\ncentre in Scotland to offer an ISO27001-accredited Safe-Haven for secure collaborative research\\nusing sensitive eHealth data. This supports personalised (precision) medicine research and\\nunderpins our involvement with UK-Health Data Research (UK-HDR) uniting health data across the\\nUK.\\nSince 2017, we have invested c. £20 million to strengthen digital capability and cyber security by\\nintegrating our many information systems and digital workflows into a single cloud-based solution\\n(OneUniversity). Phase 1 of the ‘Research & Projects’ workstream is now live and when phase 2\\nis completed, it will provide an end-to-end capability for funding opportunities and supporting bid\\nsubmission, ethical approval, post-award grant management, engagement and commercialisation.\\nResearchers will be able to monitor their projects as they progress through their lifecycle, with\\nassociated strategic planning benefits provided through real-time reporting and dashboards.\\nOur online Research Information System, Discovery, led by LLC , integrates Registry, HR and\\nresearch finance data in a public institutional repository, linked to staff and PGR webpages to\\npresent a comprehensive picture of outputs, data, activities and media interactions evidencing\\nworldwide collaborations and impact. We have established a Digital Roadmap Working Group\\nrecognising more can be done to enable sharing, storage and integration of research data and\\nenhance our digital research infrastructure in line with the UK National Data Strategy. This has\\ngained further momentum in step with the digital learning environment created in response to\\nCOVID-19 working practices.\\n4.3 Human Infrastructure\\nFollowing restructuring in 2015 an integrated University Research Office (URO) was established to\\ncoordinate Schools and Directorates research support under the strategic leadership of the VPR.\\nThe URO supports research strategy, consortia building for strategic bids, funder liaison, industry\\nengagement, IP protection, licensing, spinouts, contract negotiation and commercialisation. The\\nresearch support team concentrates on open access, digital resources and responsible use of\\nresearch metrics. It supports award set-up and management, research policy, integrity, ethics and\\nthe Code of Practice underpinning our REF submission. HR & OPD provide staffing strategy,\\nresearcher career development and EDI functions, whilst External Relations coordinate the Public\\nEngagement Forum.\\n                                                                                                  Page 9\\n\\n\\nTo enable clinical research in collaboration with NHS Tayside, the Tayside Medical Science Centre\\n(TASC) brings together facilities and expertise, including the Clinical Research Imaging Facility, the\\nTayside Biorepository and the Tayside Clinical Trials Unit, fully registered with UKCRC, supporting\\napproximately 20 trials at any one time. It underpins the work of the Academic Health Science\\nPartnership established in 2014 as a catalyst to deliver healthcare improvement research in\\ncollaboration with the NHS. Achievements include NHS-university-industry partnerships such as\\nwith Storz and Medtronic to advance medical devices development and surgical skills training.\\n4.4 Income\\nWe have the third highest proportion of research-related income (c. 40% to total income) of any UK\\nuniversity, with research grants and contracts income averaging c. £75 million per year over the\\nlast 5 years and Quality-Related (QR) research funding, in Scotland equating to Research\\nExcellence Grant, exceeding £25 million per year. To support our ambitions for sustainable growth\\nof our research economy we aim to further diversify our funding sources and prioritise large-scale\\nopportunities aligned to our interdisciplinary themes and so selectively consolidating existing\\nstrengths and targeting investment in priority growth areas (e.g. as set out by the UKRI R&D\\nroadmap and Horizon Europe). We aim to achieve similar successes as the WCAIR, working in\\npartnership with UK-HDR, the AHRC InGAME cluster and as part of UK/Scottish Government\\nregional investments such as the Tay Cities Deal.\\n4.5 Impact\\nTo support the University’s strategic focus on research with impact, the University has invested in a\\ncentralised role of Research Impact Manager working closely with Impact Champions in Schools,\\nwho coordinate informal support. RIS provide cradle-to-grave support for commercialisation and\\nindustry engagement to continue to grow our translational potential. We provide business incubator\\nspace and fund academic salaries during the development phase of their spinouts.\\nPublic engagement is essential to our vision to transform lives locally and globally, supported by\\nthe Public Engagement Forum to share knowledge and best practice and our Public Engagement\\nStrategy. We provide training and recognition through our promotions criteria, in workload\\nallocation modelling and in appraisal and promotion processes.\\nWe have long-standing Public Engagement platforms and awards, including the University’s\\nannual Stephen Fry Awards for Public Engagement, established in 2012, which are presented\\nduring the Discovery Days, a large annual programme of engagement through public talks,\\nactivities in primary and secondary schools, and open-door events. Our Saturday Series is the\\nlongest running public lecture series in Scotland.\\nOur long-term investment was recognised in 2020, when we became the first university in\\nScotland, and only the third in the UK, to receive a Gold Engage Watermark from the National\\nCo-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement (NCCPE). Awarded for exceptional strategic\\nleadership and partnership working, this institutional award builds on Faculty-level Gold awards\\nreceived by the School of Life Sciences (2017) and the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic\\nScience (2019).\\n                                                                                              Page 10\\n\", 'b_env']\n",

      "['University of Nottingham\\n 1. Context and mission\\n The University of Nottingham (UoN) was founded on the vision and philanthropic spirit of Sir\\n Jesse Boot, and awarded a Royal Charter in 1948. The University’s core mission remains\\n unchanged: to promote discovery, enterprise and the advancement of the human condition.\\n Today, we are one of the largest universities in the UK with a global presence, having\\n established overseas campuses in Malaysia (2000) and China (2004). A Midlands Innovation\\n partner institution, we also make a significant regional contribution. A founder member of the\\n Russell Group and Universitas 21, UoN is consistently recognised among the world’s top 100\\n universities (QS World University Rankings).\\n UoN’s research community comprises 1804 REF-eligible staff, 1048 research staff, and >2700\\n postgraduate research students (PGRs; UK’s seventh highest), supported by technicians and\\n professional services. Their activities and innovations have generated an ongoing research\\n portfolio of c.£640m (7/2020); demonstrated a commitment to enterprise exemplified by UoN’s\\n consistent ranking of 11th or better in the Higher Education-Business and Community Interaction\\n Survey (HEBCIS, 2.2(a)); delivered a research-led curriculum and approach to teaching that\\n contributed to UoN’s Gold (the highest) rating in the Teaching Excellence Framework (2017);\\n and supported UoN’s economic contribution to the city of Nottingham (population 300k) of\\n £760m p.a.\\n Our commitment to a broad and diverse research environment that fosters both mature and\\n emergent disciplinary areas is demonstrated by submissions to 29 REF2021 sub-panels, with\\n returns for the first time in Anthropology and Development Studies (UOA22) and Sport and\\n Exercise Sciences, Leisure and Tourism (UOA24). Researchers are organised across five\\n Faculties (Arts, Engineering, Medicine and Health Sciences, Science, and Social Sciences), that\\n house 27 Schools and Departments, six transdisciplinary Beacons of Excellence, 19\\n Interdisciplinary Research Clusters, and >160 centres, institutes, and groups. Research\\n Committee and Knowledge Exchange Committee have strategic oversight of all research and\\n impact activity and are chaired by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research and Knowledge\\n Exchange. An External Advisory Group chaired by the Vice-Chancellor supports their work.\\n Our research environment and culture enables interdisciplinary and mission-led research with\\n far-reaching societal impact, as exemplified by the innovations and achievements described in\\n individual UOA submissions. Strategic initiatives in 2013-20 reflect deep, long-term\\n commitments to: developing people, innovation in research delivery, and maximising the\\n transformative value of research. They include:\\n     \\uf0b7   Sector-leading early career support through the Nottingham Research Fellowships and\\n         Anne McLaren Fellowships scheme (3.2)\\n     \\uf0b7   Leading development of the UK’s Technician Commitment (3.4)\\n     \\uf0b7   Transformational focus on Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (3.5)\\n     \\uf0b7   Transdisciplinary Beacons of Excellence directed at Sustainable Development Goals\\n         (2.1(a))\\n     \\uf0b7   Supporting Interdisciplinary Research Clusters that drive new collaborations and\\n         innovations (2.1(a))\\n     \\uf0b7   Delivering new ways of working through Digital Research (2.1(c))\\n     \\uf0b7   Promoting innovative use of analytical instrumentation through the Interdisciplinary\\n         Centre for Analytical Science (4.1(d))\\n     \\uf0b7   A focus on industry partnerships and company spin-outs (2.2(a-b))\\n                                                                                              Page 1\\n\\n\\n 2. Strategy\\n 2.1 Research Strategy\\n Since 2013 our strategic imperative has been to create a world-leading, inclusive environment\\n that facilitates the achievements of researchers at all career stages. Key strategic goals include:\\n (a) Models for transdisciplinary, challenge-led, globally significant research\\n UoN has created six transdisciplinary research Beacons of Excellence (c.£22.5m investment\\n 2013-20), each addressing a global challenge, with its work programme directed towards United\\n Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Key features are: critical mass; breadth of disciplines;\\n and strength of external partners, including Government departments, NGOs, multinationals,\\n and specialist SMEs.\\n     \\uf0b7    Rights Lab – ending modern slavery\\n     \\uf0b7    Precision Imaging – transforming healthcare with pioneering imaging\\n     \\uf0b7    Future Food – feeding the world in the context of climate change\\n     \\uf0b7    Propulsion Futures – achieving net zero carbon transport\\n     \\uf0b7    Green Chemicals – sustainable chemical processes and materials\\n     \\uf0b7    Smart Products – intelligent products, production and consumer experiences\\n Beacons have secured £104m in external funding; generated significant impact, including 13\\n REF impact case studies; recruited and developed the next generation of challenge-led research\\n leaders and researchers, with 23 Nottingham Research Fellows (3.2) attached to Beacons and\\n PGRs integrated via Doctoral Training Centres (3.3); and brought >80 world-class researchers to\\n UoN. These activities are designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Beacons’\\n transdisciplinary approaches.\\n To facilitate blue skies, bottom-up, cross-disciplinary collaborations UoN invested (c.£5m, 2016-\\n 20) in five Global Research Themes (GRTs): Cultures and Communications; Developing\\n Sustainable Societies; Digital Frontiers; Health and Wellbeing; and Transformative\\n Technologies. Each GRT houses a group of focussed Interdisciplinary Research Clusters\\n (IRCs; formerly Research Priority Areas; 19 currently supported). These address UKRI and\\n international priorities and have developed the work of >800 researchers at all career stages\\n across UoN by pump-priming new research. Key outcomes include: c.600 publications; c.500\\n external grant applications that have secured >£300m of external funding; and enhanced impact\\n generation. For example, the Health Humanities IRC worked with the AHRC and Wellcome\\n Trust to initiate a new, national award, The Health Humanities Medal. The findings of the Water\\n Works IRC secured an invitation for UoN to be one of eight UK universities to work with UK\\n Water Industry Research to co-create opportunities between academia and industry. GRTs’ role\\n in progressing individual research careers is exemplified by the promotion of three IRC leads to\\n personal Chairs in 2019-20.\\n (b) A commitment to researchers\\n Our strategic commitment to researcher recruitment, retention, and development is described in\\n 3. While this work has applied across all levels of researchers, from professorial to PGR, a\\n particular focus has been a flagship programme of Nottingham and Anne McLaren Research\\n Fellowships (£15.4m awarded), the latter aimed at women in STEM, that recruits and develops a\\n new generation of outstanding early career researchers (3.2).\\n (c) A digitally-enabled research environment\\n Since 2013 we have identified the importance of digital transformation as a key component of\\n research innovation across the full range of UoN’s disciplines and implemented a Digital\\n Research Strategy. Investment (£9.3m) in people, services and systems, and development of\\n new user-communities is described in 4.1(d).\\n (d) Strategic growth in international research and impact collaboration\\n UoN has prioritised international research collaboration by embedding support in Beacons and\\n IRCs (2.1(a)) and by establishing the targeted strategic initiatives described in 4.1(c).\\n                                                                                              Page 2\\n\\n\\n 2.2 Impact strategy and engagement of the wider community with research\\n A signatory of the national KE Concordat, since 2013 UoN has translated its research into\\n impact and knowledge exchange via strategic initiatives and investments that foster:\\n (a) Significant advances in culture and capacity to empower translational research and\\n impact\\n Researcher engagement, training, and development in impact activities is enabled by the\\n Nottingham Impact Accelerator (NIA) (>£10.4m, Research Council IAA and HEIF investment)\\n and the ESRC Impact Leaders Programme. The Female Academic Entrepreneurs network\\n (launched through NIA) supports the engagement of women staff from Midlands’ universities\\n who are participating in knowledge exchange (KE). Increases in professional staff numbers,\\n including specialists in translational healthcare, have further embedded impact knowledge and\\n skills across UoN’s research ecosystem. KE and Impact Awards celebrate success and\\n enhance awareness within our research community.\\n UoN has developed its approach to stakeholder engagement, thereby enhancing collaborations\\n between UoN researchers and key multinationals, including Siemens, GKN, Teledyne e2v,\\n Rolls-Royce, GSK, and Unilever, helping to secure one of the highest levels of industry-funded\\n research awards (£20m, 2018-19) of UK universities. The effectiveness of these activities is\\n demonstrated by a HEBCIS ranking of 11th or better over the REF period, with a rise in\\n collaborative and contract research income from £68.5m (2012-13) to £102.8m (2018-19). In\\n the most recent (2018-19) HEBCIS, UoN ranked tenth.\\n Collaboration with local businesses and SMEs is fostered by UoN’s Innovation Park, one of four\\n pilot University Enterprise Zones, which hosts c.60 client enterprises and has supported >350\\n start-ups through UoN’s Haydn Green Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. The ERDF-\\n funded Enabling Innovation programme has supported researchers across UoN to collaborate\\n with >1500 local businesses. Our strong culture of translational research, supporting\\n organisations of all sizes, is demonstrated by UoN’s founder-membership of the Midlands\\n Technology Catapult and position as the top HEI recipient of funding from Innovate UK.\\n (b) Innovation-led growth to maximise the commercialisation of research and IP value\\n Since 2013 UoN has created >40 spin-out and related companies. Company exits yielded\\n £16.5m (2015-2020) ranking UoN second in HEBCIS for sale of shares in our spin-out portfolio.\\n Spin-outs are managed by a wholly-owned subsidiary company, Nottingham Technology\\n Ventures, established in 2017 to professionalise management to exit of a maturing portfolio.\\n This also manages investment from UoN’s Pathfinder Fund and £5m Invention Fund, to secure\\n future successes. UoN’s £2.4m support for spin-outs formed during 2013-20 has leveraged\\n £12.6m external investment that supports and accelerates spin-out growth and development.\\n UoN leads the development of a local innovation ecosystem, working with external partners\\n (e.g. BioCity Ltd) and external investors (e.g. IP Group plc, Mercia plc). UoN’s role as a Partner\\n HEI in the Midlands Innovation Commercialisation of Research Accelerator (MICRA), the UK’s\\n largest formal collaboration between technology transfer offices, provides proof-of-concept\\n funding and supports academics’ KE training and engagement with entrepreneurs.\\n (c) Improved support for policy researchers and public engagement\\n UoN’s new Institute for Policy and Engagement develops local, national, and global\\n partnerships between researchers and politicians, decision makers, organisations, and the\\n public. Since its 2019 launch, the Institute has engaged >250 policy actors, fostered six impact\\n case studies in four Faculties, and sponsored events attracting c.15,000 local and national\\n participants. It harnesses UoN’s wider influence by: co-leading (with Cambridge, Manchester,\\n Northumbria, and UCL) Capabilities in Academic Policy Engagement (Research England\\n Development-funded, £4m); and chairing the University Policy Engagement Network. UoN’s\\n founding membership of The Conversation (>35 articles 2013-20) further evidences our\\n commitment to public engagement.\\n                                                                                              Page 3\\n\\n\\n (d) Transformational impact that contributes to national agendas around place and\\n levelling up by meeting and responding to the needs of diverse local communities\\n Our leading role in Midlands Innovation is described in 1, 2.2(b), 3.4, 4.1-4.2. UoN’s Civic and\\n Regional Committee (launched 2018) provides strategic leadership for activities designed to\\n increase our civic and public value contribution. UoN chairs One Nottingham (Nottingham City\\n Council’s strategic partnership board, the only such UK board with an academic chair). In 2017-\\n 18 UoN contributed £1.1 billion to the regional D2N2 economy (2.4% of Gross Value Added).\\n Universities for Nottingham, a partnership with Nottingham Trent and key stakeholders\\n (launched January 2020), further extends UoN’s impact on the local economy, businesses,\\n groups, and individuals.\\n Key interventions have included strategic partnership investment to develop collaborations with\\n partners in the region’s cultural offer and creative economy, and with local communities (e.g.\\n Nottingham UNESCO City of Literature, hosting the British Games Institute’s cultural\\n programmes unit). UoN makes significant contributions to meeting local healthcare research\\n needs (e.g. the £24m NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, established 2016 as a\\n partnership between UoN and local NHS trusts).\\n 2.3 Open research and metrics\\n We are committed to an open, fair, and reproducible research environment (e.g. impact case\\n studies feature citizen science, open databases, and open source software). Interventions to\\n achieve this include: (i) Successful installation of the UK’s fifth ESRC-funded SafePod,\\n facilitating researchers’ local access to secure datasets. (ii) Implementation of a Research Data\\n Management Policy aligned to the Concordat for Open Research Data (UoN is a signatory),\\n UKRI Common Principles on Data Policy, and FAIR guiding principles. This mandates that all\\n researchers write a Data Management Plan before any research data is collected. As a member\\n of the Russell Group, UoN is signed up to the Sorbonne Declaration on open data. (iii) Requiring\\n researchers to acquire an ORCID ID and include it in their research outputs wherever possible\\n (UoN is a UK ORCID consortium member). (iv) Investment (£1.5m, 2015-20) in a new,\\n integrated Research Information System (RIS) that supports UoN’s open access strategy.\\n (v) Implementing policy that goes beyond REF2021’s, requiring that, where copyright allows,\\n from 1 January 2014 all research papers (including book chapters) are made available in open\\n access form via RIS. (vi) Implementing institutional commitment to the principles of the Leiden\\n Manifesto for Research Metrics and San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment.\\n Committing to the principle that research should be assessed on its own merits rather than on its\\n venue of publication. (viii) Leading development of the UK Scholarly Communications Licence\\n via participation in the UK-SCL Advocacy task and finish group.\\n 2.4 Research integrity (RI)\\n UoN is a signatory of the Concordat to Support Research Integrity. During 2013-20 we\\n appointed UoN’s first dedicated Head of RI and Ethics, revised our policies, and created a new\\n Research Integrity and Research Ethics Committee, with oversight of RI and research ethics\\n governance across the institution. All UoN researchers are governed by an annually reviewed\\n Code of Research Conduct and Research Ethics and Code of Practice on Handling Allegations\\n of Research Misconduct, the latter aligned to UKRIO, UKRI, and AMRC requirements. UoN’s\\n Research Governance Team manages all clinical research activities that fall under statutory\\n control (e.g. Clinical Trials, Animal Welfare).\\n 2.5 Strategic goals for research and impact; the next five years\\n UoN’s five-year Research Strategy enhances our long-term commitment to: developing people;\\n innovation in research delivery; and maximising the transformative value of research by\\n addressing significant global challenges.\\n                                                                                              Page 4\\n\\n\\n An illustration of this strategy is the Net Zero research centre for future transport and energy\\n which will be established on UoN’s Innovation Park, consolidating the institution’s strengths and\\n facilities to work with large industry partners and smaller companies as they adopt novel\\n technologies, materials, and processes. The centre will apply a co-production model to its\\n partnerships between university research groups and business, creating an innovation cluster\\n that will drive future research agendas.\\n UoN will also apply the innovation cluster approach with the City of Nottingham to drive\\n convergence research for health and financial services, creative industries, automation and\\n digitisation of manufacturing processes. This will draw on our disciplinary strengths in data\\n science, artificial intelligence, the arts, and robotics in a single city-centre development. The\\n centre will nurture a skilled workforce and provide an environment in which start-ups and\\n commercial partners work alongside academic staff. This will be supplemented by a maker-\\n space environment that is accessible to the public. UoN’s goal is to harness our research\\n strengths in support of Nottingham and the wider region post-pandemic and Brexit.\\n A major focus will be on research culture, supporting and developing individual research careers\\n across research teams, addressing reward and recognition schemes, and reinforcing our\\n collaborative, inclusive, and collegiate environment. UoN will concentrate on developing more\\n stable careers and pathways for researchers to transition outside of academia into industry,\\n start-up companies, public and private-sector businesses and other settings. Equality, Diversity,\\n and Inclusion will be a core strategic driver throughout, with the aim to achieve 50% women\\n Associate Professors, 30% women Professors, and 15% BAME Associate and full Professors by\\n 2025.\\n UoN is committed to transdisciplinary research, building on our research Beacons of Excellence\\n and Interdisciplinary Research Clusters programme to support next generation convergence\\n research through large-scale collaborative facilities, structures, and innovation clusters. Our aim\\n is to open major facilities to the world by enabling virtual access as part of our open science\\n agenda.\\n 3. People\\n 3.1 Staffing strategy, staff development\\n Building a Culture for Success, UoN’s competency framework, places people at the heart of our\\n culture. Individuals are progressed by recruitment and induction policies, ongoing Appraisal and\\n Development Conversations, a Rewards Scheme recognising contribution above the norm, and\\n annual promotion rounds. 642 REF-eligible staff were promoted in the census period. The\\n promotions’ distribution (40.8% F, 59.2% M, 13.9% BAME (5% Asian, 0.5% Black, 4.7%\\n Chinese, 1.6% Mixed, 2.2% Other), 2.2% Disability) closely matches that of UoN’s REF-eligible\\n staff (35% F, 65% M, 15% BAME, 3% Disability) indicating the success of EDI initiatives in this\\n area. Moreover, the increase of women at Professor and Associate Professor level across the\\n organisation has seen a narrowing of the median institutional gender pay gap for academic staff:\\n 16.9% in 2019, compared to 18.9%, 2017. Leaders proactively identify and support those from\\n under-represented groups to apply for promotion, and promotions criteria have been revised to\\n take a holistic view of research, knowledge exchange, teaching and learning, and academic\\n service. The Vice-Chancellor’s mentoring programme supports senior leadership progression\\n for academic and APM staff with protected characteristics (17 mentees, 2018-19; 9 mentees on\\n 2020 programme, start delayed to 09/20). UoN has actively considered the impact of personal\\n circumstances on all promotion applications since 2012-13, and phased out the use of citation\\n metrics in promotion cases since 2018-19.\\n Full-time and part-time Assistant, Associate, and full Professors in the Research and Teaching\\n job family are eligible to apply for a semester’s paid study leave after every six semesters of\\n service. Career pathways for part-time and fixed-term staff are particularly supported, with 459\\n REF-eligible staff moved to permanent contracts (2013-20). Disabled staff benefit from\\n institutional policies and support, with a 2018 review implementing new guidance to support their\\n managers. Staff also benefit from: a Mental Health First Aid scheme; Dignity Advisors; a\\n                                                                                                 Page 5\\n\\n\\n Wellbeing Hub; the Advance HE-accredited Nottingham Recognition Scheme; professional\\n development service; Leadership and Management Academy training programmes (launched\\n 2016); and UoN’s Research Leaders Programme (>100 participants 2013-20), which develops\\n those on the cusp of senior roles. Interventions arising from staff engagement surveys (2017,\\n 2019) include: direct staff involvement in developing UoN’s new strategy, with >2000 individuals\\n and groups responding to a consultation exercise; and opening up institutional committee\\n membership to transparent application from all levels while increasing non-professorial\\n membership. UoN policies are subject to Equality Impact Assessment and areas of inequality\\n identified and addressed (e.g. changes to promotions policy outlined above).\\n UoN has held the European Commission’s HR Excellence in Research badge continuously\\n since 2011. A member of Universities UK, UoN implemented the Concordat to Support the\\n Career Development of Researchers (2009) via dedicated action plans coordinated by the\\n Researcher Academy (3.2), with Research Staff Group and Research Committee oversight.\\n UoN has signed and will implement the 2019 Concordat.\\n 3.2 Early Career Researchers (ECRs)\\n The transformation of UoN’s Graduate School into a new Researcher Academy for PGR and\\n research staff development is part of our suite of initiatives to build the next generation of\\n researchers.\\n 115 outstanding ECRs (50% F, 16% BAME) have been recruited across all Faculties as\\n Nottingham and Anne McLaren Research Fellows (£15.4m awarded). Their careers are being\\n progressed by three years of dedicated time for research and impact, generous research funding\\n (£25k p.a.), childcare support (£5k p.a., used by 38% of the cohort), and a clear trajectory to a\\n permanent academic post. To date, Fellows have secured £20.7m of external funding (£11.6m\\n as PI), published high-quality outputs (24.6% in top 10% most-cited worldwide), and generated\\n five impact case studies. 29 have progressed to permanent positions at UoN: two to personal\\n chairs, two to Associate Professorships, 25 to Assistant Professorships. The scheme’s retention\\n rate is 95%.\\n ECRs across UoN have been supported in bids to research councils, charities and institutes,\\n and secured significant awards, including two UKRI Future Leaders Fellowships (£1.2m each),\\n 23 Leverhulme ECR Fellowships, seven British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowships, five Royal\\n Society Fellowships, an EPSRC UKRI Innovation Fellowship, BBSRC Discovery Fellowship, and\\n Royal Academy of Engineering Fellowship.\\n ECRs’ careers are additionally furthered by: annual Research Staff Development Conferences;\\n twice-yearly writing retreats; specialist support from the Careers and Employability Service; and\\n locally delivered training and activities.\\n 3.3 Postgraduate Research Students\\n UoN’s PGR community, drawn from across the globe, is an integral part of our research culture,\\n and is developed by research-led teaching and supervision. Recruitment, funding, and support\\n procedures that take EDI into account at all stages foster a diverse PGR community: F 47%;\\n BAME 38% (Asian 5.2%, Black 1.1%, Chinese 5.3%, Mixed 1.3%, Other 1.8%); Disabled 9%\\n (2019-20 intake). Since 2013 PGRs have benefitted from connected cohorts and career\\n development opportunities provided by 44 Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs) and Doctoral\\n Training Programmes (DTPs) (24 UoN-led). This £97.5m DTP/CDT portfolio is unique for its\\n breadth and interdisciplinary range, encompassing all five Faculties. It includes the UoN-led\\n Midlands4Cities, ranked first in the AHRC’s DTP2 competition, and a collaboration with\\n Rothamsted Research to build capacity in developing countries. International students comprise\\n 32% of UoN’s PGR community and have been supported by >150 sponsors, and >500\\n institutionally funded scholarships.\\n PGRs are supported by the Researcher Academy’s central leadership and management, and by\\n five Graduate Centres that provide discipline-specific training and support. PGR training is\\n                                                                                                Page 6\\n\\n\\n mapped to the Researcher Development Framework, the Research Council’s Statement of\\n Expectations for Postgraduate Training, and the QAA Quality Code. All PGRs (including Part-\\n time/Distance) are supported in their research activity and future careers by: (i) Core training,\\n including a mandatory research ethics and integrity element, delivered by the Researcher\\n Academy (21k attendances 2013-20), with disciplinary-specific training provided locally. (ii) A\\n Postgraduate Placement Programme, winner of the 2015 Times Higher Award for Outstanding\\n Support for Early Career Researchers, that provides a range of paid placements (from SMEs to\\n multinationals). (iii) A Public Engagement with Research programme, aligned to UoN’s\\n commitment as a signatory of the National Manifesto for Public Engagement, that develops\\n PGRs’ impact skills in line with best practice. (iv) Researcher Academy funding, including: Travel\\n Prizes (c.£600k awarded 2013-20, 50%F, 35%M, 15% unknown); International Research\\n Collaboration Awards, and Building Experience and Skills Travel Scholarships (£25k p.a.); and\\n support for interdisciplinary projects (£15k p.a.). (v) International mobility, including via\\n Universitas 21 and UoN’s international campuses, and doctoral training partnerships with, for\\n example, the Universities of Adelaide, Queensland, Tübingen, Virginia Tech, and Beijing Foreign\\n Studies University.\\n All PGRs benefit from QAA-compliant governance mechanisms described in UoN’s Quality\\n Manual (including mandatory co-supervision, supervision requirements, and formal annual\\n progress reviews), monitored by the Researcher Academy with Research Committee oversight.\\n 3.4 Technicians\\n UoN is sector-leading in recruiting, developing, supporting, and retaining the world-class\\n technicians whose work is crucial to our research ecosystem. UoN spearheaded and is a\\n founding signatory and Steering Board member of the Technician Commitment. We provide\\n national leadership via UoN’s Director of Technical Skills and Strategy’s role as the Science\\n Council’s Higher Education and Technician Commitment Lead. Technicians are supported\\n locally by a strategy that ensures their status, opportunity, and sustainability. Since REF2014,\\n this has delivered: a new Vision for Technical Talent (including extended career pathways,\\n conference fund, enhanced training) aligned to UoN’s wider strategic aims and objectives; a\\n technician action plan; the national report Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI): A Technician\\n Lens (2019; part of a Nottingham-led EPSRC Inclusion Matters award); and the collaborative\\n Technicians: Providing frontline and vital support for student mental health and wellbeing (2019).\\n UoN leads Midlands Innovation’s Research England-funded TALENT programme (£5m) and has\\n driven national interventions to improve opportunities (e.g. creation of a UK Higher Education\\n Technicians Summit). UoN’s distinctive and important achievements were recognised in 2018’s\\n national Technician Commitment One Year In report.\\n 3.5 Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)\\n Since REF2014, UoN has led in developing and implementing major initiatives that ensure all\\n our researchers (staff and PGRs), from recruitment to retirement, experience best practice in\\n EDI. In 2018 a new, University Executive Board-level post, Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Equality,\\n Diversity, and Inclusion, was established (one of the first such appointments in the UK).\\n Following consultation, an ambitious EDI Strategic Delivery Plan was launched, with four themes\\n tackling: Equality of experience for all; Strengthening diversity and improving inclusion;\\n Excellence and ambition in delivery; and Working in partnership with our city and global\\n community.\\n UoN delivers EDI engagement through our Leadership and Management Academy and\\n Professional Development team. UoN funds formative research and innovation in practice\\n through our Sphere Programme and Diversity and Inclusion research hub. Six dedicated EDI\\n Coordinator roles work with individual Faculties and Professional Services teams, supported by\\n an EDI Senior Project Manager. Each School has dedicated EDI leadership roles, with\\n associated workload allocation, ensuring that consideration of EDI is embedded throughout their\\n decision-making.\\n                                                                                                Page 7\\n\\n\\n UoN takes a nationally leading role in EDI through activities including: EPSRC funded project\\n work to uncover barriers to inclusivity in STEM (UoN-led, £520k); work to deliver Team Science\\n through BBSRC; leadership of the Technician Commitment; founding membership and co-chair\\n role in the National Network for EDI academic leads (NEDIAL); chairing the EPSRC’s EDI\\n Strategic Advisory Group; and membership of the Athena Swan Governance Board.\\n UoN engages with charters and external accreditations where these initiatives align with our\\n goals. We hold Institutional Silver Athena Swan status (renewed in 2018), are a Stonewall\\n Diversity Champion, registered Disability Confident employer, and signatory to the Working\\n Forward pledge, signalling support for those returning from maternity/paternity leave. We have\\n affirmed our commitment to be an anti-racist institution, and in early 2021 the institution will\\n submit for the Race Equality Charter Bronze Award. UoN has an Athena Swan peer-support\\n group and supports Departments and Schools in working towards local charter awards through a\\n peer-review challenge and support team. Academic units across all Faculties hold one Gold,\\n eight Silver and ten Bronze awards.\\n 3.6 EDI and REF\\n The construction of our REF2021 submission paid close attention to EDI. All staff involved in\\n REF2021 preparations and decision-making undertook mandatory unconscious bias training.\\n EDI was considered in decisions about REF eligibility, output and impact case study selection,\\n and access to supporting resources. EDI data was collected throughout and reviewed by\\n Research Committee and the REF Steering Committee.\\n These actions produced a submission profile of: 34.2% F; 14.7% BAME (Asian 5.2%, Black\\n 1.1%, Chinese 5.3%, Mixed 1.3%, Other 1.8%), 3.5% ethnicity unknown; 3.5% disability, 2.4%\\n prefer not to say; 92.4% on permanent and 7.6% fixed-term contracts. ECRs account for 10.6%\\n of the submission (68.2% permanent and 31.8% fixed-term contracts). The diversity of our\\n submission profile has increased since RAE2008 (F 21.4%; BAME 9.2%) and REF2014 (F\\n 29.1%; BAME 9.9%).\\n UoN followed the processes outlined in our Code of Practice. We took great care in inviting\\n individuals to declare personal circumstances (282 declarations), ensuring that active\\n encouragement was combined with protection of staff confidentiality. The PVC EDI was a\\n member of the REF Steering Committee and chaired all appeals relating to personal\\n circumstances. To ensure any areas with potential for imbalance were identified UoN conducted\\n a series of Equality Impact Assessments, covering: Research Independence; Governance\\n structures; the Personal Circumstances Process; and Selection of Outputs.\\n 4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n 4.1 Institutional strategies and supporting activities for generating research income\\n Our strategic interventions described below have supported research income generation in\\n 2013-20 of £822.3m (cf. £535.7m REF2014) across a diverse portfolio: Research Councils\\n (41%), UK Government Bodies (21%), EU sources (13%), Charities (11%), Industry (12%),\\n Other sources (2%). UoN is the top HEI for Innovate UK funding; top five for BBSRC; top ten for\\n EPSRC. UoN has 194 in-progress Horizon 2020 projects including 78 Marie Sklodowska-Curie\\n Actions,19 European Research Council grants, and 79 multi-partner international consortia\\n projects under the Societal Challenges and Industrial Leadership programmes, coordinating 22\\n of these. UoN is also the largest core European University partner in Clean Sky 1 and 2. Major\\n UK funding highlights include: leadership of the £60m Midlands Innovation Energy Research\\n Accelerator, and two UKRPIF infrastructure awards attracting £18.9m matched funding from\\n industry and charity partners.\\n Since 2013 our strategy for research income generation has concentrated on:\\n                                                                                                  Page 8\\n\\n\\n (a) Research pipeline investment\\n UoN is an EPSRC and BBSRC framework university, and our staff contribute to funding policy\\n nationally via roles on the Councils of Research England, AHRC, ESRC, and EPSRC.\\n Research leaders are therefore well placed to ensure the strategic alignment of UoN initiatives\\n with emerging priorities. This knowledge informs the work of Beacons, Interdisciplinary\\n Research Clusters (2.1(a)), UoN’s Interdisciplinary Centre for Analytical Science (4.1(d)),\\n Wellcome Prime, and HEIF Innovation and research council Impact Accelerators, which are\\n used to grow research and impact ideas from seed-corn to fully-collaborative bids and impact.\\n Examples include: development of bacteria-resistant coated urinary catheters; and supporting\\n Bank of England policy-making through measurement of business uncertainty during Brexit and\\n COVID-19. Activity is coordinated with UOA-level support (£8.2m 2013-20), where research\\n income generation is fostered by research and impact development staff, pump-priming\\n initiatives, and direct support for major bid development.\\n (b) People\\n Equal and diverse access to research funding for all staff groups has been fostered via the EDI\\n Strategic Delivery Plan (3.5), with targeted actions including: new guidance to support proactive\\n consideration of EDI in internal selection processes; addressing any gender bias in innovation\\n and entrepreneurship; and ensuring diversity in UoN’s Fellowship programmes.\\n (c) Global connections\\n UoN’s International Collaboration Fund has fostered research partnership development,\\n particularly in Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, Global Challenges Research Fund, and\\n Newton Fund areas. Over the REF period, awards totalling c.£800k have supported >250\\n projects across all five Faculties, with outputs including: >160 internationally co-authored\\n publications; 49 international workshops; and £17.3m in successful external grant applications.\\n UoN’s allocation of QR ODA grant funding and Global Challenges Collaboration Fund seed corn\\n funding has supported researchers across the institution to collaborate with Universities, NGOs,\\n and governments in 15 DAC list countries.\\n Together with the international strands of the Beacon and Interdisciplinary Research Cluster\\n programmes (2.1(a)) these actions have assisted UoN researchers to increase internationally\\n co-authored publications from 41% (2013) to 60% (2020), lead 140 UKRI-funded international\\n collaborations, and work with c.300 partners in 53 countries and the EU.\\n (d) Equipping researchers with new frameworks and ways of working\\n A commitment to innovation in research practice has been a feature of our 2013-20 strategic\\n initiatives. For example, UoN’s Digital Research Strategy provides researchers with new tools,\\n services, and support, including: expert advice and support from a new Digital Research\\n Service; a secure, fast, and affordable Automated Transcription Service; significantly enhanced,\\n GDPR-compliant Performance Storage, long-term Archiving Services, and high performance\\n computing (HPC) and cloud storage. This enhanced digital research environment has directly\\n underpinned research across all five Faculties and has been the core enabler of >£40m of\\n research funding and >100 publications. Its innovations have also increased breadth of\\n engagement across our diverse research community. As an exemplar, 25% of HPC users are\\n from non-traditional disciplines including Geography and Economics, and 22% of users are\\n women (2019-20; c.f. 12.5% 2017-18).\\n Similarly, UoN’s Interdisciplinary Centre for Analytical Science promotes collaborative research\\n and use of equipment and analytical expertise through a mixture of events and networks open to\\n all levels of researchers. Transdisciplinary working is a particular objective (e.g. investigating\\n medieval treatments for bacterial infections combined research from English and Life Sciences\\n and led to an APEX award).\\n 4.2 Infrastructure and facilities\\n The significant capabilities and critical mass of UoN’s facilities are endorsed by our success in\\n EPSRC’s strategic equipment scheme (£15.3m). They enable and underpin research and\\n impact, and attract industry and user partners, including SMEs, HEIs, and international\\n                                                                                                 Page 9\\n\\n\\n collaborators from academia, industry, and government-sponsored training. Examples of UoN’s\\n 30 facilities listed in UKRI’s portal include the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, and D.H.\\n Lawrence archive, the latter part of our National Archives-accredited Department of Manuscripts\\n and Special Collections.\\n The Facilities and Equipment Management Committee provides strategic leadership in the\\n procurement and management of UoN’s research facilities. The approach is driven by\\n researcher-need and is centred on open shared access to equipment. It aims to be future\\n focussed through maintenance of a roadmap for new equipment that reflects strategic priorities.\\n The EDI Strategic Delivery Plan supports all researchers to access the spaces and equipment\\n needed for their research (3.5).\\n Collaboration with national and international research partners is furthered by institutional\\n adoption of initiatives that facilitate greater external use of research equipment: UoN’s Kit\\n Catalogue, containing >1000 items, underpins a Midlands Innovation dataset and is directly\\n linked to the national equipment.data.ac.uk dataset (>400 UoN major items). The success of\\n this strategic approach is illustrated by UoN’s EPSRC-supported nanoscale and microscale\\n Research Centre (nmRC, launched 2016), whose globally unique facilities underpin research\\n grants of >£100m and are utilised by >1000 users, including 40 industrial companies, and\\n researchers from across all five Faculties. Applications include next-generation drug-delivery\\n systems and medical devices.\\n Institutional research and impact are enriched and connected locally, nationally, and globally by\\n the use of shared and collaborative facilities and major in-kind benefits. Collaboration is fostered\\n locally by our leading role in Midlands Innovation’s Research Efficiency Group and Energy\\n Research Accelerator (4.1). The latter’s investment in shared facilities includes the Trent Basin\\n Community Energy Test Bed, the Geoenergy Testbed, and a Research, Acceleration and\\n Demonstration Building (£12m). Globally, UoN researchers benefit from specialist facilities\\n hosted by international partners, including the Institute of New Materials (UoN’s China campus),\\n and strategic links, including with Centro Nacional de Pesquisa em Energia e Materiais\\n (CNPEM) in Brazil (host of the Southern Hemisphere’s only Synchrotron). Major in-kind benefits\\n (estimated value c.£16.9m), include use of ISIS Neutron and Muon Source (Rutherford\\n Appleton), and the Hubble Space Telescope.\\n Between 2013-20 UoN has invested in major buildings and research facilities (£111.4m research\\n component of large capital projects), focussing on ensuring buildings sustainably meet their\\n researcher communities’ needs (recognised by UI GreenMetric World University Rankings, top\\n two 2013-8, fourth 2019). As with other facilities, investment has driven innovation in research\\n practice. Examples include the creation of an Advanced Manufacturing building (supported by\\n £5m investment from the D2N2 Local Enterprise Partnership via the Local Growth Fund) for\\n research that fosters UK manufacturing by developing new technologies and systems for cost-\\n efficient, knowledge-intensive, high-value, and environmentally friendly production; and the\\n flagship Biodiscovery Institute (£23m, 2013-20), a world-leading, interdisciplinary research hub\\n that is shaping the future of health and technology.\\n                                                                                               Page 10\\n', 'b_env']\n",

Over the\\n REF period, turnover has grown by 30% from £447M to £583M (2019/20).\\n 1.5 Institutional history and research focus\\n Founded as the Hartley Institution in 1862, the University gained its Royal Charter in 1952.\\n Consistent with our strategy, we strive for quality throughout our research that is comparable\\n with the highest international standards.\\n Throughout our history we have sought to innovate in research and education, including world-\\n class landmarks that have inspired other institutions across the globe:\\n     •   First electronics department in the world (1947);\\n     •   Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (1965);\\n     •   Pioneering work in Cancer Immunology and Developmental Origins of Health and\\n         Disease (1970s);\\n     •   First UK medical programme with students interacting with patients throughout (1972);\\n     •   Optoelectronics Research Centre (1989);\\n     •   Centre for Operational Research, Management Sciences and Information Systems\\n         founded (1997) after more than 30 years of research in this field;\\n     •   Southampton Statistical Sciences Research Institute (2003).\\n                                                                                              Page 3\\n\\n\\n We were early innovators in Geographical Information Systems and continue to lead in the field\\n of Web Science. We combine strengths in computing, marine geophysics, history, environmental\\n science, ship science and archaeology to be world-leading in maritime archaeology. Social\\n Statistics and Demography includes the ESRC Centre for Population Change - the largest\\n demography group in the UK - and the National Centre for Research Methods, a focal point for\\n national research and training. Music, leveraged by our sound and vibration research, is an\\n internationally-recognised centre of excellence for research. This combination of a proud history\\n and ongoing innovation leads to vibrant research activity across all disciplines.\\n All disciplines, departments and schools have high levels of research activity. Of our 2606 FTE\\n academic staff, 80% have balanced (education and research) or research-led contracts\\n (hereafter collectively referred to as “researchers”) with the expectation they will be research-\\n active; 15% follow education-led and 5% enterprise-led pathways (see §3.1). As described in our\\n Code of Practice (CoP), all balanced and independent research-led staff with significant\\n responsibility for research (1313 FTE) are included in our REF 2021 submission.\\n A 70-strong team, Research & Innovation Services (RIS), facilitates academic collaborations,\\n industrial interactions, knowledge-exchange and the commercialisation of intellectual property\\n (IP). RIS also supports the academic community through dedicated teams for research funding\\n development, research contracts, research governance & integrity and enabling impact.\\n 2. Strategy\\n 2.1 Strategic goals and achievements to 2020\\n The 2010 strategy described our future ambitions and priorities with excellence in research at\\n the core of our ambition. Our strategic goals for delivering research excellence and\\n achievements during this assessment period included:\\n      •   Developing existing world-class research with all disciplines contributing to our\\n          ambition to achieve a top-10 performance in the REF. We placed 18th for GPA (Grade\\n          Point Average), 8th for research intensity and 11th for research power in REF 2014 with\\n          top-5 power rankings in five UOAs and top-5 GPA rankings in five.\\n                                                                                                Page 4\\n\\n\\n     •   Attracting, developing and retaining high-achieving staff\\n         Global searches for potential leaders in all areas of activity. University Fellowships attract\\n         leading international researchers including Nobel Laureate, Professor Brian Schmidt\\n         from 2014-2017.\\n      •  Supporting innovative research across disciplines to address global challenges\\n         Achievements include, amongst others, Professor Emma Tompkins, lead-author of\\n         Chapter 29, Small Islands, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2018);\\n         and WorldPop providing spatial demographic datasets for researchers and policymakers\\n         in Latin America, Africa and Asia to support development, disaster-response and health.\\n     •   Increasing income from research grants\\n         3,890 research grants awarded during the REF period totalling £890M.\\n     •   Supporting and increasing our early career researchers and postgraduate\\n         research students through institution-wide “career-track” fellowship schemes and\\n         scholarships.\\n 2.2 Strategy to 2026\\n Our 2016 strategy, underpinned by a 10-Year Plan, has a research and enterprise vision to:\\n     “Consolidate our position as a world-leading research-intensive university, increasing our\\n     profile for generating knowledge and technologies that have real economic and social\\n     benefits for the world. We will produce high quality research and, through our distinctive\\n     interdisciplinary approach, focus on addressing society’s greatest challenges.”\\n The strategy ensures our research underpins our education activities and that we win funding\\n that maximises the research we can sustainably undertake. It comprises six focus areas:\\n      •  People: Developing and recruiting world-leading academic staff and doctoral students\\n         and supporting them through their career journey to secure funding and undertake world-\\n         changing research.\\n      •  Sustainability: Recovering a greater portion of direct- and indirect-costs by rebalancing\\n         our funder-mix, producing accurate full-economic costing and charging for commercial\\n         research based on market-price, not cost.\\n      •  Enterprise and Impact: Enhancing the distinctiveness of our strong enterprise\\n         ecosystem within a strategic framework to deliver impactful research, diversify income\\n         streams and provide valuable opportunities for staff and students.\\n      •  Professional Services support: Strengthening interfaces between directorates and\\n         internal and external stakeholders, including two dedicated units, PERu and PP|S (§2.9)\\n         to support public engagement and impact.\\n      •  Interdisciplinary research: Growing our interdisciplinary research, developing our\\n         institutes and providing an environment that stimulates such activities.\\n      •  International: Ensuring our research is positioned to enhance our international profile with\\n         academic, government and corporate partners and to influence opinion-formers and\\n         policymakers.\\n                                                                                                Page 5\\n\\n\\n 2.3 Enabling Impact\\n We have a strong track-record of generating high levels of impact through translational research\\n across almost all disciplines. Consistent with the principles of the Knowledge Exchange\\n Concordat, our Enterprise & Impact (E&I) strategy recognises the diversity of activities within the\\n University ecosystem, including:\\n      •   Business acceleration and incubation\\n      •   Consultancy\\n      •   Continuing professional development\\n      •   Corporate partnerships\\n      •   Enterprise units\\n      •   IP protection and licensing\\n      •   Public engagement\\n      •   Public policy impact\\n      •   Spinout companies\\n      •   Student enterprise\\n The E&I strategy is overseen by the Southampton Enterprise Board (SEB) chaired by the VP\\n Research & Enterprise (VPRE). Each Faculty has an E&I board reporting to SEB and convenes\\n IP panels to pursue patenting and licensing. The strategy recognises the distinction between:\\n     (i) Commercial enterprise activities - expected to return a financial surplus to the University in\\n     addition to delivering impact;\\n     (ii) Other activities associated with developing an enterprise ecosystem and delivering\\n     impact, including business incubation, student enterprise, public policy and public\\n     engagement.\\n Commercial enterprise income (consultancy, facilities, regeneration, CPD and IP) grew by £17M\\n (39%) between 2013/14 and 2018/19 to £61M/year, the second highest in the sector, and at\\n 10.4% of turnover, the highest proportion in the Russell Group (source: HEBCIS).\\n Investment in ecosystem development and impact is largely provided through the Higher\\n Education Innovation Fund (HEIF) (£4.4M in 2019/20) and Impact Acceleration Accounts\\n (EPSRC £3.9M, 2017-2021; ESRC £1M, 2019-2023; STFC £120k, 2019-2020).\\n Since 2013/14 the University has ranked first or second in the UK for the financial value of its\\n consultancy and engagement with small and medium-sized companies (HEBCIS). Much of our\\n E&I activity is regionally-focused:\\n      •   Founding member of SETsquared (with Bath, Bristol, Exeter and Surrey universities),\\n          ranked by UBI Global as the World Top Business Incubator managed by a university\\n          since 2015;\\n      •   University Science Park hosts ~100 companies, employing over 1500 people;\\n      •   Student Union-affiliated Enactus Southampton crowned UK national champion five times\\n          since 2012 and world champion in 2015;\\n                                                                                                Page 6\\n\\n\\n      •   Future Worlds, a unique on-campus startup accelerator, nurtures aspiring entrepreneurs\\n          to move technologies to commercialisation. It has supported 150+ projects, launching\\n          50+ student/staff startups. These have raised £7M+ equity investment at a valuation\\n          £40M+ and employ 100+ people;\\n      •   Four Royal Society-funded entrepreneurs-in-residence provide guidance and advice on\\n          commercialisation and business engagement;\\n      •   ICURe (Innovation to Commercialisation of University Research) provides nationwide\\n          support for potential university startups. Aims include improving the entrepreneurial skills\\n          of ECRs and strengthening links between academic and industrial communities. Initiated\\n          from Southampton in 2014 within SETsquared, £38M has been invested in supporting\\n          342 teams, leading to the creation of 111 new companies and 500+ jobs in the UK.\\n Our interdisciplinary research units also support impact (§2.6).\\n 2.4 Open Research\\n The University is a leader in open research, open access (OA) publishing and archiving. Our\\n “EPrints” platform is used by 675+ institutional and subject repositories worldwide. The Open\\n Research Group (ORG), comprising the Library’s Associate Director, VPRE, Associate Deans\\n Research and academic, post-graduate and professional representatives, oversees institutional\\n OA and research data management policies. Institutional policy and guidance on responsible\\n research metrics were established ahead of signing DORA in 2019. ORG leads the University’s\\n contribution to national and international OA policy and infrastructure, allocates funds for OA\\n publishing, monitors compliance with policies and ensures wide engagement with best practice.\\n Original research outputs are increasingly published and available via open access, growing\\n from 83% (2016/17) to 87% (2019/20).\\n 2.5 Regional and national priorities\\n We are strongly engaged with regional and national research agendas including research\\n councils, national academies and government departments (e.g. appointments of Chief Scientific\\n Advisors to the Food Standards Agency and for National Security). Regionally we have close\\n relationships with the EM3 and Solent Local Enterprise Partnerships, and with SETsquared and\\n the Science and Engineering South (SES) Consortium; our two previous Presidents served a\\n combined five-year term on the Solent LEP board and VPRE is board member for SETsquared\\n and SES.\\n We lead, or strongly engage with many major national research priorities, including the Faraday\\n Institution, Future Flight (Aerospace Technology Institute), Alan Turing Institute, Rosalind\\n Franklin Institute, the UK Collaboratorium for Research into Infrastructure and Cities and have\\n close relationships with national capabilities such as the National Oceanography Centre,\\n Diamond Light Source and the Francis Crick Institute. Engagement is commonly through our\\n interdisciplinary units.\\n 2.6 Interdisciplinary research and collaboration\\n With a longstanding commitment to interdisciplinary research, we maintain low barriers between\\n Faculties, Schools and Departments, with much cross-disciplinary activity evolving organically\\n and becoming distinctive parts of the University (§1.5). Since 2013 we have considered specific\\n needs and opportunities requiring an interdisciplinary approach. Building on existing strengths,\\n                                                                                               Page 7\\n\\n\\n this resulted in the creation of five new University Strategic Interdisciplinary Research Institutes\\n (USIRIs):\\n      •   Institute for Life Sciences (IfLS)\\n      •   Southampton Institute for Arts and Humanities (SIAH)\\n      •   Southampton Marine and Maritime Institute (SMMI)\\n      •   Web Science Institute (WSI)\\n      •   Zepler Institute (ZI)\\n Each USIRI is led by a Director and advised by a strategic advisory board chaired by the VPRE\\n and including the Deans. Each institute represents a research community of 200+ members,\\n focusing their research and embedding them in a network spanning the University and beyond,\\n and playing an important role in generating impact and reputational benefit. We have invested\\n ~£2M/year in the USIRIs and received an estimated 200% ROI. Conceived during the REF\\n period and launched in November 2020, SIAH will raise the visibility and identity of arts and\\n humanities research to our local, national and international audiences.\\n We actively encourage self-forming University Strategic Research Groups (USRGs),\\n interdisciplinary research communities originating from community-led proposals. Focused on\\n particular opportunities, USRGs have lifetimes of 3-5 years, each receiving funding of\\n ~£20k/year. Currently, there are three such groups, but beyond the interdisciplinary\\n infrastructure shown (§1.3), there are 25+ academic and industrial research centres and\\n institutes. The interdisciplinary research strategy and its implementation is led by an AVP.\\n Additionally, two overarching interdisciplinary strategies have been adopted by UEB: on Life\\n Sciences and Environmental Sustainability. These extend beyond interdisciplinary research and\\n guide key decisions such as hiring staff, development of educational programmes and\\n investment in facilities.\\n 2.7 International partnerships\\n We have prioritised international research engagement, jointly-led by the VPRE and VP\\n International. An AVP leads strategic international projects, including research collaborations.\\n These are supported by an International Relations team working with RIS (§1.5). Each Faculty\\n has an Associate Dean International.\\n The University is a member of several strategic international partnerships, including:\\n      •   Worldwide Universities Network (WUN), a global network of 22 research-intensive\\n          universities spanning 13 countries.\\n      •   RENKEI partnership with 12 leading Japanese universities.\\n      •   Epigen consortium with Singapore and New Zealand.\\n      •   Confucius Institute in collaboration with Xiamen University.\\n      •   The Photonics Institute with Nanyang Technological University.\\n      •   The India Centre for Inclusive Growth and Sustainable Development with business\\n          partners and policy makers.\\n      •   University of Southampton Malaysia, delivering research and education in Iskandar.\\n                                                                                                 Page 8\\n\\n\\n International research funding (outside UK and EU) increased from 4.1% to 8.5% of total\\n research income during the REF period (£4.5M (2013/14), £10.2M (2019/20)). EU funding\\n (£17.7M (2019/20)) averaged 16.0% in the same period.\\n The proportion of our papers published with international co-authors has grown from 52% during\\n the last REF to 58% between 2014 and 2019, indicating an increasingly internationally-\\n connected University (Source: SciVal, August 2020).\\n                                                          Co-authors (%)\\n                                   International      National       Institutional      None\\n    Southampton                         58.0            20.3             13.4            8.4\\n    Russell Group average               54.1            18.8             13.0            14.2\\n 2.8 Research Integrity\\n The University is a signatory to the Concordat to Support Research Integrity and has robust\\n policies to ensure we maintain the highest standards in research. VPRE chairs the Research\\n Integrity & Governance (RIG) Committee comprising Associate Deans Research, and the\\n University Research Ethics Committee comprising the chairs of the Faculty Ethics Committees\\n and a lay member. Each Faculty has a research ethics committee (chaired by an experienced\\n academic and including at least one lay member) and in some cases one or more sub-\\n committees covering specialist areas. The committees are supported by a RIG team of seven\\n staff and an on-line ethics approval system, ERGO II which processed 5000+ applications from\\n staff and students in 2019/20.\\n 2.9 Community Engagement\\n Two Interdisciplinary Research Units support impact delivery:\\n 1) Public Engagement with Research unit (PERu) is a founding signatory to the UK’s Manifesto\\n for Public Engagement and has played a significant role in the sector via the RCUK/UKRI-\\n funded Schools University Partnership Initiative (SUPI) (£200k), Catalyst Seed Fund packages\\n (£125k), and Strategic Support to Expedite Embedding PER (£98k) programme. The RCUK\\n Funding Assurance report 2017-18 noted the University provides “a comprehensive and holistic\\n PER support package” for researchers in all disciplines including a seed-fund that has enabled\\n impact from 80+ projects.\\n PERu delivers diverse public engagement events including the annual Southampton Science\\n and Engineering Festival (founded 2004), attracting 8000+ people to engage with researchers\\n and projects (155 exhibiting teams in 2019); and the “Human Worlds Festival”, aligned to the\\n AHRC-supported, national Being Human programme, which similarly engages the public in arts,\\n humanities and social science research. Other initiatives include:\\n      •   Partnership with the Winchester Science Centre since 2017 to co-create exhibits for\\n          190,000+ annual visitors.\\n      •   Activity Mapper (visualises outreach with schools/other publics) has recorded 800+\\n          events since 2018, maximising the quality, sustainability and impact of public\\n          engagement.\\n      •   Building collaborative capacity to support sustainable interactions between the University\\n          and deprived communities.\\n      •   Supporting Southampton’s bid for City of Culture 2025.\\n                                                                                              Page 9\\n\\n\\n 2) Public Policy|Southampton (PP|S) supports the local, national and international public policy\\n impact of our research. Four policy experts (supplemented by secondees) operate three key\\n themes: stimulating evidence demand in government; supplying evidence; and increasing policy\\n engagement capacity amongst the research community. The team’s activities include:\\n      •  Collaborating with the UK Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology and UK\\n         government departments, including Chief Scientific Advisors.\\n      •  Delivering our affiliation with the Cambridge Centre for Science and Policy (CSaP)\\n         Fellowship scheme.\\n      •  Delivering PhD and ECR knowledge-exchange secondments to local and national\\n         government, including Cabinet Office, BEIS, Department for Education, Southampton\\n         City and Hampshire County Councils.\\n      •  Delivering Policy|Training sessions and supporting a Policy|Network.\\n 3. People\\n 3.1 Staffing strategy and staff development\\n Consistent with the University strategy, we prioritise recruiting and developing world-leading\\n academic staff and building strong Professional Services to support them in winning research\\n funding and undertaking world-changing research. A revised staffing strategy, “Reward and\\n Recognition”, introduced in 2014 provides a framework with six job families ERE, RESN, TAE,\\n MSA, CAO and Clinical as illustrated below.\\n                                                                                             Page 10\\n\\n\\n To ensure equity across the University and between staff in different job families, the cumulative\\n expectations for capability and performance at each level (1-7) are defined for individuals\\n progressing through the pay scale. The ERE job family has four career pathways: balanced,\\n education-led, research-led and enterprise-led. Clear descriptors for promotion, based solely on\\n merit, exist for each pathway and level, with all ERE staff supported by mentors through the\\n promotion process.\\n Movement between job families and career pathways is encouraged, reflecting individuals’\\n changing interests and institutional requirements. ERE promotions and movements between\\n pathways are initially considered within the Faculty and then the University-level Academic\\n Promotions Advisory Group, with final approvals by Senate and Council. Promotions and in-level\\n transfers at level 6 (Associate Professor-equivalent) and level 7 (Professor) involve an interview\\n panel chaired by a member of UEB. All staff are required to have an annual appraisal with their\\n line manager recorded via an on-line system. Appraisal outcomes are moderated by the next-\\n level manager with UEB scrutiny to ensure University-wide consistency.\\n 3.2 Study leave and flexible working\\n ERE staff may apply for sabbaticals/study/research leave. Provision for such leave is one\\n semester in every four years of service. Special leave-of-absence may be granted to enable staff\\n to accept temporary research appointments elsewhere of up to two years. Following discussion\\n with line managers, decisions are taken at Department or School levels taking account of the\\n objectives and wider staffing requirements in that unit. Such leave is routinely taken and plays\\n an important role in maintaining a vibrant research culture.\\n Flexible or remote working is routinely enabled where needs are identified. Line managers and\\n Heads of School, supported by HR Business Partners, make these decisions and put in place\\n the necessary support for staff working in these modes.\\n 3.3 Staff recruitment and progression\\n Each Faculty and School has an overall strategy, including staffing plans, which are discussed\\n as part of annual business planning. Overarching University strategies (e.g. life sciences and\\n environmental sustainability) encourage hiring in particular areas. Our research community\\n increased steadily until 2016/17 in line with the University's growth strategy, and then underwent\\n a planned contraction in response to the uncertain economic climate.\\n                                                                                             Page 11\\n\\n\\n Promotions at levels 4-7 (Postdoctoral Research Assistant (level 4); Lecturer/Senior Research\\n Fellow (5); Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor/Principal Research Fellow (6);\\n Professor/Professorial Fellow (7)) have remained relatively stable as has the percentage of male\\n and female researchers promoted during the REF period.\\n 3.4 Supporting our staff\\n We take a whole-organisation approach to the wellbeing of all staff and students, led by the\\n Health, Safety & Risk Directorate. The strength of the University’s community is key, as it fosters\\n a wide range of interactions and networks that promote wellbeing, including social, cultural and\\n recreational events and activities.\\n The areas of focus are Mental Health and Stress, Physical Health, Occupational Health and\\n Emergency Response with a rich range of resources available, and a diverse programme of\\n activities to promote wellbeing and self-awareness of issues that might affect one’s own, or\\n                                                                                             Page 12\\n\\n\\n colleagues’ and fellow students’ wellbeing. The University is a signatory to the Mindful Employer\\n Charter and runs an assistance programme providing confidential advice for colleagues.\\n We have a supportive policy for managing ill-health, including guidance for return-to-work and\\n contact with the University during prolonged absences. Allowances are made in terms of\\n workload and timetabling in discussion with line managers and HR Business Partners, and a\\n Parents and Carers network provides peer and professional support.\\n 3.5 Career pathways for part-time and fixed-term staff\\n The University is a signatory to the Concordat to Support the Career Development of\\n Researchers and is implementing the seven key principles, including Principle 6 that “diversity\\n and equality must be promoted in all aspects of the recruitment and career management of\\n researchers”. The Concordat is implemented via the Centre for Higher Education Practice\\n (CHEP) which provides opportunities for academic professional development for all staff and\\n PGRs. Concordat Champions in each Faculty support local implementation of the principles.\\n Training and networking events are provided across the University and overseen by a Concordat\\n Steering Group led by the AVP Interdisciplinary Research.\\n Staff policies apply equally to both full-time and part-time staff (certain benefits may apply pro-\\n rata to their hours). Policies which facilitate part-time working include flexible working, job\\n sharing, career breaks and voluntary reduced hours. All staff policies conform to equality and\\n diversity legislation and form an integral part of our wider equality and diversity agenda.\\n Over the assessment period, the percentage of researchers (FPE) on permanent contracts has\\n grown from 58% to 61%, the fourth largest increase in the Russell Group (HESA 2013/14-\\n 2018/19).\\n 3.6 Early Career Researcher development\\n In addition to the Concordat (§3.5), our commitment to supporting researchers’ careers was\\n substantiated in 2020 on renewal of the European Commission’s HR Excellence in Research\\n Award (first achieved 2012). The University’s ERE Career Pathways provides clear guidance for\\n ECR development while an ECR network, supported by CHEP, provides access to networking\\n events, discussions on career development, access to mentoring, and peer-mentoring through\\n action-learning sets.\\n A University-wide approach is taken to help ECRs applying for fellowship funding, led by the\\n Associate Deans Research and supported by RIS. Our strong enterprise and impact\\n environment supports ECRs seeking to follow entrepreneurial career paths, and in public\\n engagement and public service, while the University Careers & Employability Service assists\\n ECRs exploring non-academic careers.\\n 3.7 Training and supervision of PGR students\\n The Doctoral College, led by a senior academic director reporting to VPRE and VP Education,\\n provides a focal point for doctoral training and researcher development. Regulations for doctoral\\n degrees are developed in combination with the Education Committee and Academic Quality and\\n Standards Committee. CHEP, in partnership with the Library, RIS, iSolutions and Careers &\\n Employability Service, delivers a flexible and high-quality learning experience including a core\\n development programme via face-to-face training and on-line courses, aligned to Vitae’s\\n Researcher Development Framework. EDI, research ethics and data management modules are\\n mandatory.\\n                                                                                                 Page 13\\n\\n\\n PGRs can also participate in intensive training and development activities through summer\\n schools. Each Faculty has a Graduate School, led by a director which ensures implementation of\\n University policy regarding doctoral students and degrees, and maintains a local doctoral\\n student community. During the REF period, the University participated in 26 externally funded\\n CDT/DTPs awarded by all UKRI research councils, the NHS and UK Government. For the\\n ~3,000 PGR students we host, 57% funding comes from external, non-UKRI sources.\\n 3.8 Equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI)\\n In October 2019, a new governance structure was implemented to provide clearer routes\\n through which EDI matters can be raised and decisions made. VPRE is the University’s EDI\\n champion and chairs the EDI committee reporting to UEB.\\n The focus on improving EDI is ensured through a strategy and action plan. All protected\\n characteristics are covered by the strategy, with resulting policies and initiatives supported by an\\n EDI team in HR. An annual diversity report on our performance is reviewed by UEB, Senate and\\n Council, and is publicly available. EDI is a key component of the University’s staffing strategy\\n and all staff involved in hiring, appraisal and promotion processes are required to undertake EDI\\n training.\\n We have signed two key pledges: Time to Change, a national campaign to end mental health\\n discrimination; and the Mindful Employer Charter to create a supportive and open culture for\\n employees with mental health issues. The University is a founding signatory of the Athena Swan\\n charter and received a Silver award in October 2016 following ten years work at bronze-level. In\\n addition, nine Schools and Faculties have obtained silver and bronze departmental awards,\\n recognising their work to implement University policies and broaden awareness of gender\\n equality in their local area.\\n We are a member of Inclusive Employers, which supports building inclusive workplaces and a\\n partner of AccessAble (formerly DisabledGo) to promote disability-accessible buildings. In\\n December 2017 we became the first UK university to achieve Disability Confident Leader status,\\n the highest level accreditation for employers committed to ensuring recruitment processes are\\n inclusive and accessible; this was reaccredited in 2020.\\n                                                                                              Page 14\\n\\n\\n In January 2018 the University signed the Race Equality Charter to improve the representation,\\n progression and success of minority ethnic groups of staff and students. In 2019 we conducted a\\n University-wide equality survey to understand our staff’s experiences in relation to their gender\\n and race in our community. We are working towards a bronze award by 2022.\\n Staff and students maintain networks and societies to represent, support and engage members\\n who share a similar background, characteristic or common cause, for example:\\n     •   Black Asian and Minority Ethnic Staff Network\\n     •   Christian, Islamic and Jewish student societies\\n     •   Disability Staff Network\\n     •   International societies\\n     •   Parents' and Carers' Network\\n     •   Pulse LGBT+ Staff Network\\n     •   Student Union Feminist Society\\n     •   Theano\\n     •   Women in Science, Engineering, Technology and Humanities (WiSET+)\\n These groups are autonomous with their own terms of reference and aims. They participate in\\n an annual programme of networking events and provide advice to the University when it\\n develops new or existing policies.\\n We have been a Stonewall Diversity Champion since 2010.\\n Our Equal Pay Reviews show that the University provides equal pay for work of equal value and\\n that the mean gender pay gap has reduced to 18.9% (21.5% in 2017, 22.9% in 2015); they include\\n recommendations and action plans to raise awareness and address issues, including continuing\\n to remove barriers to promotion for women. The University has achieved its 2020 target to have\\n 30% female representation on all University Committees and is aiming for 40% by 2025.\\n We aim for the highest EDI standards and have a zero tolerance towards discrimination,\\n harassment and bullying.\\n 3.9 REF submission\\n Our Code of Practice (CoP) was widely communicated internally and published on the University\\n website.\\n The Reward and Recognition framework (§3.1) unambiguously defines ERE staff on balanced\\n and research-led pathways, readily identifying all researchers having significant responsibility for\\n research. Rigorous monitoring of staff records (on a weekly basis by RIS and at least annually\\n by Faculty REF committees) ensured that the diversity of the staff cohort returned to REF,\\n matched the criteria specified in our CoP.\\n Committees at University, Faculty and UoA levels provided robust oversight of REF policies and\\n scrutiny of processes to ensure these were inclusive, and over 130 staff involved in REF\\n decision-making attended bespoke, unconscious-bias workshops. An initial Equality Impact\\n Assessment (July 2019) was widely circulated and findings discussed at UEB and other senior\\n management meetings. The final EIA identifies subsequent enhancements made to REF\\n processes and recommends improvements to systems and the collection of data for protected\\n characteristics.\\n                                                                                              Page 15\\n\\n\\n 4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n 4.1 Research income\\n Increasing research and enterprise income, and overhead and full economic cost-recovery are\\n strategic priorities. Overhead cost-recovery has improved from 28.1% (2013/14) to 29.2%\\n (2019/20). Income growth during the REF period is shown in the table.\\n                          Income(£M)        2012/13      2019/20     Growth\\n                          Research             147          173       18%\\n                          Enterprise            37           59       59%\\n                          Total                184          232       26%\\n                         Source: Financial Accounts\\n Research applications targets are set annually as part of the business planning process and are\\n a focus in appraisal discussions for all research-active staff; progress is monitored monthly by\\n Finance and UEB.\\n The VPRE, Associate Deans Research and Enterprise, Deputy Heads of School for Research\\n and RIS are actively engaged in supporting individual members of staff and research groups to\\n apply successfully for research funding. Where applications are evaluated as being strategic at\\n the Faculty and/or University levels, additional bid support is provided.\\n 4.2 Specialist infrastructure and facilities\\n The University has consistently ensured its research is supported with appropriate infrastructure\\n and facilities, investing regularly and strategically in a wide range of leading-edge experimental\\n facilities. Since 2014, major investments include:\\n     •    The Boldrewood Innovation Campus, in partnership with Lloyd’s Register, with the\\n          largest university-owned towing tank in the UK. Boldrewood also houses the National\\n          Infrastructure Laboratory (NIL) (part of the UKCRIC) and facilities for autonomous system\\n          development and testing, and other fluid dynamics research (£100M+ including £26M\\n          from EPSRC for NIL).\\n     •    Upgrading the University’s major research wind tunnel, the RJ Mitchell, as part of the\\n          National Wind Tunnel Facility (£0.7M, EPSRC).\\n     •    High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure with the creation of a new Data\\n          Centre and three upgrades of Iridis, one of the largest computational facilities in the UK.\\n          These support work across the University, including in Arts, Humanities and Social\\n          Sciences (£50M+).\\n     •    Centre for Cancer Immunology, including animal facilities and state-of the art research\\n          equipment (£27M).\\n     •    µ-Vis Computed Tomography Centre, which supports work across the University\\n          including in Archaeology, Palaeontology and Music (£10M).\\n We maintain one of the world’s most capable cleanrooms for micro- and nano-fabrication with\\n exceptional capabilities in optoelectronics. This underpins the Zepler Institute and represents an\\n ongoing investment of £120M+ since 2007. Over the next decade capital funding will be used to\\n leverage external funds, including philanthropy, to continue to develop our research facilities.\\n                                                                                                Page 16\\n\\n\\n This is also the aim behind the allocation of £0.75M/year to the Multi-User Scientific Equipment\\n for Research (MULSER) fund.\\n The Library’s annual budget (£8.5M) includes £4M to support research including access to\\n 8,000+ academic journals, 1.6M volumes and 6.5M historic manuscripts.\\n Turner Sims concert hall and John Hansard Gallery are internationally recognised Arts Council\\n England national portfolio facilities.\\n 4.3 Shared/Collaborative facilities\\n The University hosts two EPSRC National Research Facilities, Crystallography and Physical\\n Sciences Data-Science services, and is an access point to the National Dark Fibre Infrastructure\\n Service. We are a founding member of the SES Consortium (with Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial,\\n UCL, King’s College and QMUL), which shares computational and experimental equipment to\\n ensure effective use across the region, and has successfully created three “Tier 2” HPC clusters.\\n We are a major user of the UK National Supercomputing service, ARCHER and the STFC\\n Harwell Research Campus, in particular, the Diamond Light Source as well as international\\n synchrotron facilities across a wide range of research areas. We regularly collaborate on\\n international programmes using major research facilities in Oceanography, Physics and\\n Astronomy. Our own facilities are regularly accessed by users from other institutions and\\n industry, nationally and internationally. The development of a publicly available equipment\\n register (https://equipment.data.ac.uk/) was led by the University.\\n 4.4 Major benefits-in-kind\\n We regularly receive donated equipment from industry partners, or significant discounts from\\n equipment suppliers wishing to have their equipment used at the University. During the REF\\n period we acquired £72M capital equipment with £28M from grants and donations, while income-\\n in-kind (REF4c) totalled £123M.\\n 4.5 EDI enhancements\\n Robust approaches to equality and diversity apply to all aspects of our operations including\\n acquisition of research funding and support for accessing infrastructure. Workload models,\\n designed and operated by individual schools, assign teaching and administrative duties in a way\\n that ensures staff have a substantial baseline to undertake research. Workload levels are fully\\n transparent, allowing gender benchmarking and fairness in the allocation of work. All\\n researchers (full- and part-time) are offered research leave with the timing of sabbaticals\\n scheduled to accommodate staff circumstances where necessary, with financial support for\\n seed-corning new work or conference attendance, allocated by staff grade to ensure gender\\n parity.\\n                                                                                             Page 17\\n\", 'b_env']\n",

      "[\"University of York\\n 1. Context and mission\\n Research culture and focus\\n     1. Since its foundation in 1963, the University of York has built an international reputation for\\n         academic excellence. The values which were integral to its creation - excellence, public\\n         good, equality, community and internationalism - continue to underpin our ethos and\\n         culture, and shape our approach to the societal challenges we face today.\\n     2. Our academic departments (paragraphs 7-8) retain a high degree of autonomy, which\\n         underpins their excellent disciplinary research. Our researchers are afforded the\\n         intellectual freedom to think creatively, cross disciplinary boundaries and establish\\n         pioneering research programmes that have quickly established our international profile\\n         across the Arts and Humanities, Sciences and Social Sciences.\\n     3. We have maintained our highly collegial approach to research, while growing the number\\n         of staff and departments. This is facilitated by our emphasis on a shared community, rather\\n         than hierarchical management structures, and by our place in a small city with an\\n         international outlook. In addition, there is a University commitment to an egalitarian\\n         approach to working, with an emphasis on partnership across different career stages and\\n         creation of strong and supportive relationships between academic and professional staff.\\n     4. To expand our existing research strengths and develop new opportunities for collaboration\\n         within and beyond the institution, we established seven cross-cutting Research Themes\\n         (2015-) to meet the grand scientific, social and environmental challenges of our time:\\n         Creativity; Culture and Communication; Environmental Sustainability and Resilience;\\n         Health and Wellbeing; Justice and Equality; Risk, Evidence and Decision Making;\\n         Technologies for the Future. Each theme is led by a University Research Champion, a\\n         senior research leader with a significant time allocation. The Champions involve staff at all\\n         career stages in their activities and support large and strategic bids for funding (paragraph\\n         11).\\n Wider institutional context\\n     5. The University is a campus-based, research-intensive university with 27 academic\\n         departments (Table 1) within three Faculties, over 18,000 students and 1,600 academic\\n         and research staff. We have a strong commitment to the links between research and\\n         teaching, and seek to build a university that distinguishes itself in i) the world-leading\\n         quality of its research and impact, ii) its outstanding teaching (TEF Gold), and iii) the quality\\n         and value of the students’ university experience. Two of our departments are specialist\\n         research-only centres: the Centre for Health Economics and the Centre for Reviews and\\n         Dissemination. The Hull York Medical School (HYMS) is a joint venture with the University\\n         of Hull. At York, HYMS staff undertake their research aligned with one or more departments\\n         and are returned to the UoAs linked to these departments.\\n     6. We are at the forefront of many national and international research centres and\\n         programmes (paragraph 11). Our research is facilitated by our range of external affiliations\\n         at regional, national and international levels, including:\\n             ● Regionally: we participate in:\\n                      ○ The White Rose Universities Consortium (1997-), founded with the\\n                           Universities of Leeds and Sheffield.

Since its foundation, the University has had a wide disciplinary mix, most recently\\n         expanded by establishment of the Department of Theatre, Film, Television and Interactive\\n         Media (2007-), The York Management School (TYMS, 2007-) and the York Law School\\n         (2008-).\\n     8. Since 2015, our academic departments and centres have been structured into three\\n         faculties which, like our Research Themes, encourage and facilitate working across\\n         disciplines. Faculty Research Groups enable departments to a) input into research policy;\\n         b) share good practice; and c) develop cross-departmental and cross-faculty research.\\n Table 1 - Academic departments and faculties\\n  Sciences                             Social Sciences                  Arts and Humanities\\n      ●   Biology                         ●   Centre for Health             ●    Archaeology\\n      ●   Chemistry                           Economics                     ●    English and Related\\n      ●   Computer Science                ●   Centre for Reviews                 Literature\\n      ●   Electronic Engineering              and Dissemination             ●    History\\n      ●   Environment and                 ●   Economics and                 ●    History of Art\\n          Geography                           Related Studies               ●    Language and\\n      ●   Health Sciences                 ●   Education                          Linguistic Science\\n      ●   Hull York Medical               ●   Politics                      ●    Music\\n          School                          ●   Sociology                     ●    Philosophy\\n      ●   Mathematics                     ●   Social Policy and             ●    Theatre, Film,\\n      ●   Physics                             Social Work                        Television and\\n      ●   Psychology                      ●   The York Law School                Interactive Media\\n                                          ●   The York\\n                                              Management School\\n\\n\\n 2. Strategy\\n Achievement of institutional research and impact objectives during the assessment period\\n     9. The University Research Committee (URC), chaired by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor for\\n         Research, oversees research performance, strategy, policy and integrity. We launched our\\n         current Research Strategy in 2015 and this has been implemented ahead of schedule,\\n         delivering a step change in our research endeavours. Our five strategic aims were:\\n             i.    Recruiting and retaining the best researchers at all career stages, and supporting\\n                   and mentoring existing staff, to provide an attractive environment in which research\\n                   can flourish (section 3);\\n            ii.    Giving our major interdisciplinary research strengths focus, identity and presence,\\n                   to encourage interdepartmental and international research activity (paragraphs 11-\\n                   13);\\n           iii.    Recognising the role of departments in supporting their staff in the development of\\n                   their research (section 3);\\n           iv.     Deploying university resources to support research excellence (paragraph 10 and\\n                   section 4);\\n            v.     Supporting our postgraduate research students and their supervisors to train a\\n                   vibrant research community of excellent research scholars (section 3).\\n Supporting Research Excellence and Interdisciplinarity\\n     10. We have invested in our core research excellence through a variety of mechanisms\\n         (section 4). The events organised by our Research Champions, centres and faculties\\n         facilitate the development of new ideas and collaborations. These have utilised funding\\n         from our University Research Priming, Research Champions and departmentally-\\n         managed funds. Our Research Development Fund has provided significant matched\\n         funding to support major research bids (paragraph 11) whilst our Strategic Investment\\n         Funds have developed major new initiatives including the Interdisciplinary Global\\n         Development Centre (2017-). This leads interdisciplinary research and teaching, and\\n         builds equitable partnerships for global development. Led by the Departments of Politics,\\n         Environment & Geography, and History, it has members from 20 departments.\\n     11. Drawing on these mechanisms, our seven Research Themes (paragraph 4) have driven\\n         significant new developments, including opportunities arising from the Global Challenges\\n         Research Fund (GCRF) and Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF). Our focus on\\n         supporting large-scale bids has underpinned a range of research centres, hubs and\\n         programmes which bring together partners from multiple sectors to produce world-leading,\\n         impactful research. These include:\\n                a. Digital Creativity Labs (UOAs 4, 11, 12, 15, 21, 23 and 33b). This £18m project\\n                   (funded by UKRI, university partners, and industry) brings together over 100\\n                   partners and 30 researchers from multiple disciplines to deliver impact from\\n                   research in the games and media industries. Recent projects have built on this\\n                   success. XR Stories (£15m) was established to support the region in becoming the\\n                   UK centre of excellence in digital screen storytelling. This AHRC and ISCF project\\n                   is one of nine Creative Industry Cluster investments, and is led by our Research\\n                   Champion for Creativity. WEAVR is a £5.8m ISCF project which is developing\\n                   immersive technologies and data-driven content production for e-sports (UOAs 11\\n                   and 33b); doctoral training is provided through IGGI (paragraph 34).\\n                b. The EPSRC Quantum Communications Hub (UOAs 9, 10 and 11). York leads this\\n                   partnership of universities, private sector companies and public sector bodies, to\\n                   exploit the fundamental laws of quantum physics for the development of secure\\n                   communications technologies and services. The Hub is funded as part of the UK’s\\n\\n\\n                 National Quantum Technologies Programme, with grants of £24m for both phase\\n                 1 (2014-19) and phase 2 (2019-2024);\\n             c. Assuring Autonomy International Programme (UOAs 11 and 12). This £12m\\n                 partnership (2018-) with the Lloyd’s Register Foundation leads research, training\\n                 and standards in the safety of robotics and autonomous systems. It is directed by\\n                 our first Research Champion for Risk, Evidence and Decision Making. The Institute\\n                 for Safe Autonomy (2019-) addresses global challenges in assuring the safety of\\n                 robotics and other systems that use artificial intelligence, supported by £10.5m from\\n                 the UK Research Partnership Investment Fund and £24.5m from industrial partners\\n                 and private donors;\\n             d. Leverhulme Centre for Anthropocene Biodiversity (UOAs 2, 5, 7, 11, 15, 19, 21, 27\\n                 and 28). Established in 2019, this £10m international collaboration explores how\\n                 the relationship between humanity and the natural world is changing, and how to\\n                 develop a sustainable Earth. It includes research from humanities, social sciences\\n                 and sciences, with two of our Research Champions as associate directors;\\n             e. Thanzi la Onse (Health of All) (UOAs 2 and 19). Led by our Centre for Health\\n                 Economics, the £6.6m Thanzi la Onse UKRI GCRF project (2017-21), aims to\\n                 improve population health and reduce health inequities in Malawi, Uganda and\\n                 Southern and East Africa (UOA 2).\\n Impact\\n     12. York’s University Strategy (2015-20) states that our research will be “life-changing in its\\n         impact”. Our Strategic Framework for Research Impact (2015) details our objectives to\\n         enable impact in areas including policy, health and wellbeing, environmental sustainability,\\n         social welfare, economic development and cultural enrichment. To achieve these\\n         objectives, we have strengthened our support for impact by establishing academic Impact\\n         Leads at departmental level, appointing University and faculty-based Impact Managers\\n         and allocating funding for impact (paragraphs 49-50). To further develop our impact\\n         culture, we host an annual Impact Conference and organise a termly Impact Forum, to\\n         share best practice. Achievements across a range of our Research Themes include:\\n             a. Health and wellbeing. Our health economic research has been instrumental in\\n                 resource allocation decisions within the NHS and global health budgets (UOAs 2\\n                 and 16). We have influenced health policy and practice nationally and\\n                 internationally, including the development of NICE guidelines in numerous clinical\\n                 areas (UOAs 2 and 16), in the ethical oversight of Public Health England’s activity\\n                 (UOA30), and through a longstanding partnership with the World Health\\n                 Organization (UOAs 19 & 28).\\n             b. Environmental sustainability and resilience. Our research on air pollution and air\\n                 quality, ocean and marine protection and conservation, and biodiversity has had a\\n                 lasting and influential international impact (UOAs 5, 7, 8 and 10). The University\\n                 hosts one of the centres of the internationally renowned Stockholm Environment\\n                 Institute (SEI), ranked as the world’s top think tank for environmental policy in 2019\\n                 (UOA7). Interdisciplinary research led by TYMS focuses on the environmental,\\n                 economic and health impacts of global food systems (UOAs 2, 7, 11, 17 and 19).\\n             c. Justice and Equality. Our world-leading social policy research has had an impact\\n                 on welfare policy nationally and internationally in areas such as social inequality\\n                 and child wellbeing (UOAs 20 & 21). Our research on applied human rights has\\n                 influenced policies and practices supporting human rights defenders across the\\n                 globe (UOAs 18 & 19), whilst our forensic science research has informed regulatory\\n                 policy and legal practice in the UK and beyond (UOA26).\\n             d. Technologies for the Future. In the physical sciences, our research on magnetic\\n                 disk drives and information storage has made a significant contribution to the\\n                 computing industry (UOA9), and our research on structures of enzymes has led to\\n                 the development of new processes yielding biofuels and enzymes for industry\\n\\n\\n                  (UOA8). In biological sciences, our leading work on improving crop yields has\\n                  impacted on the global production of anti-malarial agents (UOA5).\\n             e. Culture and Communication. In the arts and humanities, our expertise in the\\n                  preservation and conservation of the historic environment has changed the way\\n                  glass conservation is approached and executed at York Minster and beyond\\n                  (UOA32), and explored innovative ways of engaging the public at other cathedrals\\n                  and historic sites such as the Palace of Westminster (UOA28). Research from York\\n                  on silent Shakespeare films, Dickens and South African Jazz has had global impact\\n                  on creative practice, cultural organisations and education (UOAs 27 & 33a).\\n     13. To engage our wider community with our research, we run a diverse programme to\\n         educate, entertain and inspire the public. The flagship York Festival of Ideas attracts\\n         annual audiences totalling over 30,000 to more than 200 events involving speakers,\\n         exhibitions, theatre, music and films. The University is a signatory to the Civic University\\n         Agreement and the NCCPE Manifesto for Public Engagement.\\n Research Integrity\\n     14. The University expects the highest standards of research integrity. We revamped our\\n         framework for research integrity in 2014, including updates to the University’s Code of\\n         Practice on Research Integrity (revised 2019), Code of Practice and Principles for Good\\n         Ethical Governance (revised 2017) and Policy for the Investigation of an Allegation of\\n         Research Misconduct (revised 2017). Through this framework, we ensure compliance with\\n         the UUK Concordat to support research integrity. Nationally, we have participated in the\\n         Russell Group’s Research Integrity Forum since 2015, to advance a collaborative\\n         approach to dealing with research misconduct and to share good practice. We launched\\n         our own Research Integrity Forum (2015-) to exchange best practice internally and we\\n         subscribe to the UK Research Integrity Office, enabling researchers to benefit from its\\n         advice and support.\\n Open Research\\n     15. Overseen by our Open Research Strategy Group, we have published an Open research\\n         statement which describes our commitment to the values, principles and culture of open\\n         research. Through a programme of events and online resources, the Group is developing\\n         a community of open research practice by showcasing and sharing case studies across\\n         disciplines (UOAs 4, 8, 15 and 23) to create new opportunities for outputs and methods to\\n         be reused, reproduced and credited.\\n     16. The University’s Policy on the Publication of Research (launched 2014) goes beyond\\n         ensuring funder compliance and requires that research outputs be deposited in White Rose\\n         Research Online wherever possible. The Library supports the White Rose University Press\\n         (with Leeds and Sheffield), a fully Open Access publisher of peer-reviewed journals and\\n         monographs (2016-), and manages the York Open Access Fund. White Rose University\\n         Press journals have a global reach, with access from over 120 countries. The Press’ first\\n         monograph, Star Carr, has seen over 28,000 downloads since its publication in 2018\\n         (UOA15). We support the development of national and international open access\\n         infrastructure through financial contributions to the Directory of Open Access Journals, the\\n         Open Library of the Humanities, the arXiv preprint repository, and membership of ORCID.\\n     17. The University’s Policy on Research Data Management (launched 2014) ensures that\\n         researchers manage their data effectively, and share it wherever possible, typically via a\\n         national, international or subject repository, or via our own Research Data York service.\\n         Since 2017, the York Research Database has provided a public portal to access our\\n         datasets, wherever they are held. Our Department of Chemistry has a long track record in\\n\\n\\n         advancing the open data agenda internationally (UOA8) and we host the Archaeology Data\\n         Service, a world-leading digital repository for archaeological data (UOA15).\\n Future strategy\\n     18. Our future strategy is built on our commitment to be a University for public good, drawing\\n         on a rich tradition of thought and action on social justice and combating inequality that is\\n         distinctive to the University and the City of York. Our research will combine strong\\n         disciplinary foundations with a distinctive York tradition of creative interaction across\\n         disciplines. This gives us the capacity to discover and apply knowledge around some of\\n         the biggest challenges and opportunities our society faces, including environmental\\n         sustainability, energy, public health, digital technologies, the creative arts, the value of the\\n         humanities, and global development. The broad strategic aim which will guide us is\\n         pursuing “research with relevance and reach”. Our research will be:\\n             a. Driven by curiosity, creativity and innovation, and guided by our principles of rigour,\\n                  integrity, diversity, inclusion, and public good;\\n             b. Measured by the impact we have on pressing and emerging economic, social,\\n                  cultural, and environmental challenges;\\n             c. Delivered through a progressive research culture by which we develop exceptional\\n                  leadership in research by supporting strong career paths;\\n             d. Fostered by our University-wide capabilities in areas of research strength, with\\n                  collaboration across disciplines and a focus on tackling real world problems;\\n             e. Built on a diverse set of local and global networks, ensuring our discoveries are\\n                  made in collaboration with our regional, national and international partners.\\n 3. People\\n Staffing strategy and staff development\\n     19. Our 2015-2020 Research Strategy aimed to recruit and retain the “best researchers at all\\n         career stages” by providing an attractive research environment, underpinned by a\\n         commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion.\\n Recruitment and promotion\\n     20. We have established programmes to recruit international research leaders, including an\\n         ‘Inspirational Research Leaders’ programme (2017) which appointed senior academics\\n         across the institution. The York Research Fellowship Scheme (2019-) attracts and\\n         supports the best early career researchers in winning external fellowships, including two\\n         UKRI Future Leadership Fellows in 2019 and four Leverhulme Early Career Fellowships\\n         in 2020. Our recruitment by age profile of academic (research and teaching) staff is shown\\n         in Figure 1.\\n Figure 1. Recruitment by age profile during the assessment period - academic, research and\\n teaching staff\\n\\n\\n     21. As part of York’s 2018-22 Athena Swan action plan, we have actively encouraged the\\n         promotion of more women to Reader and Professorial roles, and the percentage of\\n         Category A submitted senior female staff has increased from 28% to 35% during this REF\\n         period (Figure 2d). There has also been a reduction in the mean gender pay gap for\\n         academic staff from 16.5% (2014) to 15.3% (2019) (the median is 13.6%). The promotion\\n         of under-represented groups has been further supported by i) enabling applicants to\\n         disclose equality related circumstances that have impacted on their ability to evidence\\n         achievement (including those related to COVID-19), and ii) ensuring BAME representation\\n         within the academic promotions panel, which has resulted in increasing the diversity of our\\n         staff (Figure 2c). Alongside research, impact and innovation activities are also now firmly\\n         established within the progression framework.\\n Figure 2. Percentage of Category A submitted professors and senior academic staff by protected\\n characteristic, 31/07/2014 and 31/07/2020 by a – age, b – disability, c - ethnicity and d - gender.\\n\\n\\n Staff development\\n     22. Our revised Statement on Research Performance Expectations (2015) sets the framework\\n         for departments to establish the expected performance norms within their discipline,\\n         differentiated by staff grade. This provides clarity for staff on what a successful researcher\\n         is expected to do, and on what support they can expect from their department and the\\n         University. Mentoring, coaching and leadership programmes (such as the York Research\\n         Leaders for experienced research-active staff who manage large grants and teams) are\\n         available to all academic and research staff to develop their research, professional and\\n         career goals. To support a culture of responsible research evaluation, we established our\\n         Policy for Research Evaluation using Quantitative Data (2017). This is informed by (and\\n         aligns with) the Leiden Manifesto and San Francisco Declaration on Research\\n         Assessment, to which the University has been a signatory since May 2018.\\n     23. Departments set and implement their policies for research leave, with oversight from URC\\n         to ensure the quality of the provision. The majority enable staff to have defined time to\\n         concentrate on research and/or impact (typically, one research term after nine teaching\\n         terms).\\n Inclusivity\\n     24. Our flexible working policy enables staff to balance their work with other commitments,\\n         including caring responsibilities (COVID-19 Annex). The concept of ‘core hours’ for\\n         departmental business enables staff to work flexibly and contribute fully to key decision-\\n         making bodies. We have introduced a carers’ fund, to cover the additional costs incurred\\n         attending events (such as conferences) outside of normal hours.\\n     25. Staff wellbeing is supported by a range of measures including our policy on managing ill-\\n         health and sickness absence, projects such as Well@York (which share resources on\\n         wellbeing), and sources of advice and support, such as occupational health and the mental\\n         health first contact network.\\n     26. The University is committed to appointing staff on open contracts wherever appropriate.\\n         Our policy on fixed term contracts (updated July 2020) ensures a review to support the\\n         transfer to open contracts for staff who have two years’ continuous service. 96% of our\\n         Category A submitted staff are employed on open contracts. Our Code of Practice for the\\n         Management of Staff on Fixed-term Contracts ensures parity of esteem, including in\\n         access to promotion and training.\\n Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers\\n     27. York was one of the first ten UK universities to be awarded the European Commission’s\\n         HR Excellence in Research award in 2010 and retained this in 2018, recognising our\\n         commitment to the implementation of the principles of the Concordat to Support the Career\\n         Development of Researchers. York plays an active role in national networks supporting\\n         the development of the revised Researcher Development Concordat, of which we are a\\n         signatory (2020).\\n     28. On-going compliance is assured through a robust institutional framework, overseen by the\\n         Concordat Implementation Group. Our 11 departmental-level research staff associations\\n         and network of research staff liaison officers enable us to embed these principles within\\n         our research culture. This model was commended by the HR Excellence review panel and\\n         has been adopted by other universities. There is a diverse training and development\\n         programme available to our researchers (paragraph 32), supplemented by an annual\\n         Research Staff Conference and comprehensive online resources.\\n\\n\\n Early Career Researchers\\n     29. Our probation framework (reviewed 2016) ensures support for new members of academic\\n         research and teaching staff. This includes mentoring, a reduced teaching load to support\\n         the development of research and the Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice, which\\n         includes training in integrity and ethics. Additionally, independent research fellows can\\n         access a range of mentoring and training (paragraphs 21 and 32).\\n Research Students\\n     30. The York Graduate Research School (YGRS, 2015-) was created as a key aim of the 2015-\\n         2020 Research Strategy, to provide institutional oversight of postgraduate research.\\n     31. Our approach is centred on the fundamental value we attribute to the relationship between\\n         students and their supervisors, who meet for regular supervision meetings. Additionally,\\n         all students have a biannual meeting of their Thesis Advisory Panel who review and advise\\n         on academic progress and professional development. Formal reviews of progress by an\\n         independent panel occur at the end of years 1 and 2 (and 3 for four-year PhDs), assessed\\n         against institutional criteria. The online SkillsForge system brings together records of these\\n         meetings and wider training into one place, to support effective supervision and enable\\n         institutional monitoring against policy requirements.\\n     32. Beyond departments, the Research Excellence Training Team provides training for\\n         research students (and staff) in a range of areas including knowledge exchange and\\n         partnerships; personal and professional development; data management and open\\n         access; research integrity and ethics. Our research communication events such as PhD\\n         Spotlight, 3 Minute Thesis and ResearchBites have resulted in successes in national\\n         competitions. We have also established training to support supervision across the\\n         University, including 'Becoming an Effective Researcher' and ‘Being an Effective\\n         Supervisor’, built on the UK Council for Graduate Education’s principles.\\n     33. Our Policy on Research Degrees sets out our governance framework and includes clear\\n         policies to support distance learning, integrated and cross-disciplinary PhDs, to enable\\n         creative programme development. There is institution-level decision-making for all leave\\n         of absence and extension requests to ensure transparency and consistency which has\\n         improved on-time submission. 81% of research students who started in 2015/16 have\\n         completed on time, compared to 72% who started in 2013/14.\\n     34. The YGRS Dean has oversight of all training grant applications, matched funding requests\\n         (paragraph 10) and international sponsor relationships. During the assessment period,\\n         York has been successful in a series of external Doctoral Training Partnerships (DTPs),\\n         including the White Rose AHRC and ESRC DTPs, the BBSRC White Rose Doctoral\\n         Training Partnership in Mechanistic Biology, the NERC DTPs (ACCE and PANORAMA),\\n         EPSRC CDTs (IGGI and Fusion), and the Wolfson Trust Studentships in the Humanities.\\n         This funding has supported 18% growth in the number of PhDs awarded between 13/14\\n         to 18/19.\\n Equality and diversity\\n     35. Our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy (2017-2022) sets out our commitment to\\n         create an inclusive community where diversity is recognised, valued and celebrated. Our\\n         Code of Practice sets out how this has informed our REF submission.\\n     36. To build this inclusive community, we established a network of departmental Equality\\n         Champions whose role includes: i) raising awareness of campus wide equality activity; ii)\\n\\n\\n          supporting departmental equality initiatives, such as Athena SWAN and; iii) celebrating\\n          and promoting equality activities and success. Our five staff equality networks involve over\\n          200 staff in sharing good practice and providing peer support and development: the Athena\\n          SWAN Forum, INCLUDE (Inclusive Network Connecting and Linking University Disabled\\n          Employees), LGBTI Matters, Women in Research Forum and the Staff Race Equality\\n          Forum (SREF). The SREF is working on our institutional response to Black Lives Matter,\\n          implementing initiatives to improve our support for, and understanding of, the barriers\\n          faced by our BAME staff.\\n     37. We have made significant progress with Athena SWAN accreditation, with 19 departments\\n          holding an award (July 2020) compared to seven at the outset (August 2013). We are the\\n          only UK HEI to date to hold three Gold awards. Chemistry was the first UK department to\\n          achieve a Gold award (held since 2007) and Biology was the first UK biology department\\n          to achieve Gold in 2014. 93% of our academic departments have established a self-\\n          assessment team. Institutionally, York holds a Bronze award.\\n 4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n Research income\\n     38. Our research income has grown, built on an 81% growth in UKRI income between 2013/14\\n          to 2018/19, which has increased our market share from 1.5% to 2.1%. In order to achieve\\n          this, we have:\\n              a. Focussed our research capacity by establishing seven Research Themes\\n                   (paragraph 4);\\n              b. Identified strategically important funding opportunities, with a focus on increasing\\n                   the number of larger research grants (paragraph 11);\\n              c. Ensured a strong network of support for these bids with our Research Development\\n                   Managers working alongside Research Champions and Associate Deans\\n                   (Research) to establish research teams for major collaborative projects;\\n              d. Committed internal funds (paragraphs 10 & 20) to support emerging projects,\\n                   provide substantial matched funding for external bids, and attract excellent\\n                   research fellows;\\n              e. Increased our disciplinary-specific research support, through departmental and\\n                   faculty-based staff.\\n Infrastructure and facilities\\n Facilities\\n     39. The central Library buildings are open 24 hours a day, 362 days of the year. We subscribe\\n          to over 21,000 journals and house the Humanities Research Library, Borthwick Institute\\n          for Archives, King’s Manor Library and York Minster Library. This holds outstanding\\n          collections including an extensive collection on stained glass (UOA32).\\n     40. We have a range of high-value science facilities, accessible to external users in\\n          government, industry and the third sector. Our Atmospheric Chemistry Building\\n          (established by the Wolfson Foundation, 2014) was expanded in 2018 with £6.7m of\\n          investment from NERC and the University, creating the largest dedicated space for\\n          atmospheric chemistry research in any European university. Our Bioscience Technology\\n          Facility (BTF) provides access to state-of-the-art equipment for an international network of\\n          academic and commercial users (COVID-19 annex). We are part of the Technician\\n          Commitment initiative, providing national-level leadership via our project TechYork, which\\n\\n\\n         supports and trains our technical staff to develop the high-level skills which underpin our\\n         cutting-edge scientific research.\\n     41. We invested £2.5m to deliver a step change in our High Performance Computing (HPC)\\n         provision, which uses cluster computing to combine access to local, regional and national\\n         facilities. Our new Viking cluster (2019) is ~7 times larger than our previous HPC system,\\n         providing researchers with access to 7,500 cores and 2.5Pb of storage along with GPUs\\n         for artificial intelligence and machine learning research. This facilitates research in areas\\n         including climate modelling, archaeological analysis, artificial intelligence and machine\\n         learning. This upgrade moved York to the top quarter of the Russell Group for HPC\\n         provision. We also benefit from shared facilities, including the N8 Centre of Excellence in\\n         Computationally Intensive Research.\\n Challenge-led interdisciplinary research centres\\n     42. Housed within the new £12.5m Environment building, the York Environmental\\n         Sustainability Institute (2011-) facilitates world-class interdisciplinary research on\\n         environmental sustainability for the research community, industry and policy-makers\\n         through its research on sustainable food, resilient ecosystems and urban living. It involves\\n         academics from 17 departments and over 130 external partners.\\n     43. The Centre for Future Health (2016-), co-funded by the University and Wellcome Trust,\\n         was created with the ambition to support cutting-edge, interdisciplinary projects that\\n         address the world's most important health and wellbeing challenges. It has funded projects\\n         from 18 departments across all three faculties.\\n     44. The York Biomedical Research Institute (2017-) has brought together a critical mass of\\n         biomedical researchers across nine departments to grow innovative fundamental,\\n         experimental and translational multi-disciplinary research in biomedical and clinical\\n         sciences.\\n     45. Drawing on world-leading research and innovation in Biology and Chemistry, BioYork\\n         (2018-) brings internal and external partners together to drive the development of UK bio-\\n         based industries to deliver growth, jobs and environmental benefits.\\n Faculty-based research centres\\n     46. The Humanities Research Centre (HRC, 2009-) coordinates research across and beyond\\n         the Faculty by developing interdisciplinary initiatives and providing extensive support for\\n         research and impact. The purpose-built £11m Berrick Saul Building offers dedicated space\\n         for research centres including the Centre for the Study of Christianity and Culture and the\\n         Centre for Global Health Histories. The centre also provides work space for postgraduate\\n         research students, postdoctoral staff and visitors.\\n     47. The Faculty also leads four internationally-renowned interdisciplinary period centres:\\n         Centre for Medieval Studies, Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies, Centre for\\n         Renaissance and Early Modern Studies and the Centre for Modern Studies. The latter two\\n         are based at the HRC.\\n     48. The Research Centre for Social Sciences (2013-) supports departments in research\\n         development, impact and research training. The building provides workspace for doctoral\\n         and postdoctoral researchers, visiting scholars and research groups and centres including\\n         the Centre for Applied Human Rights.\\n\\n\\n Enabling impact\\n     49. To support researchers pursuing knowledge exchange (KE) and impact, the University and\\n         Faculty Impact Managers work with the Research and Enterprise directorate to develop\\n         partnerships with external organisations and to plan, track and evidence the impacts from\\n         our research. They also i) broker links with government and policy makers, for example,\\n         with the Cabinet Office Open Innovation Team; ii) facilitate commercial knowledge\\n         exchange, for example, via our award winning Enterprise Fellowship programme; and iii)\\n         enable funding, for example, a 100% success rate in AHRC Follow on Funding.\\n     50. We allocate funding to researchers for impact and KE work, including HEIF (over £20m\\n         since 2014), Impact Acceleration Accounts from the EPSRC (£1.3m, 2017-2020), BBSRC\\n         (£300k, 2018-2021), ESRC (£660k, 2014-2018; £1.1m, 2019-2023) and an Arts and\\n         Humanities Impact Accelerator Fund (£65k/year since 2016-2017). Additional funding is\\n         available through GCRF Impact Development Awards (£261k for 2018-2020), which\\n         primed the Thanzi la Onse project (paragraph 11e), and by the Centre for Future Health\\n         (£811k, KE, Impact and Translation Awards since 2016).\\n\\n\", 'b_env']\n",

Context and mission\\n 1.1 Founded in 1895 as the Birmingham Municipal Technical School, Aston evolved into the\\n        UK’s first College of Advanced Technology in 1956, and became a University in 1966.\\n        Today, we are a ‘dual intensive’ University, which values excellence in education and\\n        research equally. Aston University’s mission is to deliver for its beneficiaries (Figure 1):\\n     i.    Students – through research led pedagogy and training work-ready graduates (70% of\\n           students participate in an Integrated Placement Year).\\n    ii.    Business, Professions, and Public Sector – through collaborative research with practical\\n           outcomes for partner organisations (e.g., BT, GW Pharmaceuticals, Thales, Defence\\n           Science Technology Laboratory, West Midlands Police and Public Health England).\\n   iii.    Region and Society – through informing policy and public debate, increasing the\\n           knowledge base (e.g., West Midlands Combined Authority, Greater Birmingham\\n           Chambers of Commerce, or Birmingham Women’s and Children’s Hospital).\\n With that ‘beneficiaries approach’ at its core, the Aston Strategy 2018-2023 is innovative in its\\n focus on impactful research, student placements, graduate job pathways and CPD programmes.\\n Growth of the Institution\\n 1.2 The Aston Strategy 2018-2023 explicitly recognises the importance of attracting, retaining,\\n and supporting high quality staff; our recruitment processes ensure that candidates career aims\\n closely align with our strategic objectives. In 2019, 68% of Aston students and 25% of academic\\n staff identified as Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic. The University is committed to increasing the\\n representation of minority groups amongst all staff and students and The Guardian named Aston\\n University of the Year 2020 in recognition of this commitment and our track record. Aston is\\n aware of the difference between the composition of our staff and student populations: we have\\n committed to the Race Equality Charter and are developing an application for a Bronze award\\n during 2021-22.

Strategy\\n University Structure\\n 2.1 Between 2014 and 2020, Aston University was organised into five academic Schools; these\\n were consolidated as three Colleges in August 2020. In REF2021 we are returning to seven\\n Units of Assessment (Figure 2). This structure will further embed the priorities of the University\\n Research Strategy (section 2.3), by providing more opportunities for cross-disciplinary research.\\n 2.2 Research Committee is a Sub-Committee of Senate with responsibility for the development,\\n implementation and evaluation of the Research Strategy, including integration of the University\\n and College Strategies. This structure is reinforced by weekly informal meetings between the\\n PVC Research and College Associate Deans for Research. Our REF Code of Practice details\\n the University’s governance structures for REF2021.\\n 2.3 Aston’s Research Strategy (2019-2023) is constructed around four mutually-reinforcing\\n elements: Impact, Collaboration, Excellence, and Sustainability. Together with our new\\n Knowledge Exchange (KE) Strategy, it provides a framework to prioritise strategic investment,\\n and assess how research and KE activities deliver for our beneficiaries.\\n 2.4 Aston’s commitment to excellence informs all our activity; including the recruitment, support,\\n retention and development of exceptional individuals at all career stages (section 3). This\\n commitment reinforces Aston’s position as a ‘dual-intensive’ institution, with the quality of\\n Aston’s teaching recognised by TEF Gold (2017). In 2020, Aston was named The Guardian’s\\n University of the Year, and the Times Higher Outstanding Entrepreneurial University, while the\\n new Students’ Union building won The Guardian’s ‘Buildings That Inspire’ award. We mark our\\n successes through our annual Research Celebration event and KTP Showcase, both hosted by\\n the Vice-Chancellor.\\n 2.5 A central pillar of our Strategy is the role played by Aston’s newly accredited collaborative,\\n multi-disciplinary University Research Institutes (URI). Each URI represents an area of critical\\n mass, and excellent research with impact: Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies (AIPT-\\n UoA12); Energy and Bioproducts Research Institute (EBRI-UoA12); Aston Institute of Health and\\n Neurodevelopment (IHN-UoA3); Aston Institute for Forensic Linguistics (AIFL-UoA26). The URIs\\n are priorities for research capital investment, and are key drivers of financial sustainability,\\n accounting for one-third of research awards in 2019-20.\\n 2.6 Our ‘beneficiaries approach’ and track-record of research on real-world problems mean that\\n impact is deeply embedded in our academic units and our professional services teams (section\\n 4). For example, our portfolio of 27 KTPs (eighth largest in the UK) provide an excellent platform\\n for delivering research with impact. Aston’s KTP team won awards at the Innovate UK ‘Best of\\n the Best’ National KTP Awards in 2019 and 2020.\\n                                                                                                Page 4\\n\\n\\n 2.7 Collaboration is a critical element of translation and delivering impact to our beneficiaries\\n (ILES-4.7). Aston currently has over 30 institutional-level research partnerships with international\\n universities (58.7% of outputs were published with international co-authors in this REF period),\\n and over 100 further partnerships focussing on staff and student exchange. Aston has research-\\n focussed Knowledge Exchange relationships with 50 Industry Partners (5.8% of outputs during\\n the REF cycle include industrial co-authors (above average)).\\n 2.8 The future health of Aston’s research environment is predicated on financial sustainability.\\n Our position as a ‘dual intensive’ University and the resulting commitment to widening\\n participation, retention, student placements and employability involves numerous resource\\n intensive interventions; consequently, the more financially sustainable our research is, the more\\n we can afford to do. Our support for bidding for research funding is clearly set out, including\\n policies for internal peer review, match funding and due-diligence. Our objective is to grow\\n funding from UKRI, Government (including KTPs) and industry: in 2019-20, we won our highest-\\n ever level of UKRI awards (£8.5m out of £30m).\\n Interdisciplinary research (IDR)\\n 2.9 Aston actively facilitates IDR at all levels (individual, group, institutional), as well as with\\n research partners in the UK and abroad. We invest in IDR through the URIs (section 2.3), Study\\n Leave, the International Collaboration Fund and activities run by the Strategic Funding\\n Managers (SFMs) (section 4.5).\\n 2.10 Interdisciplinarity forms a significant element of training provision for Post Graduate\\n Researchers (PGRs) and Early Career Researchers (ECRs) delivered by the Aston Graduate\\n School (AGS), the ECR Forum and Organisational Development. AGS organises an annual\\n conference around an IDR topic, as well as an annual Interdisciplinary Seminar Series with\\n invited academic speakers.\\n Research Integrity\\n 2.11 Aston’s Research Integrity Policy and associated Research Integrity Assurance Procedures\\n expect the highest standards of integrity in the conduct of research. The University is a signatory\\n of the UUK Concordat to Support Research Integrity, and is committed to the principles of\\n honesty, rigour, transparency, open communication, care, and respect.\\n 2.12 Aston University Research Integrity Office (AURIO) is the central point of contact for\\n Research Ethics, Governance, and Integrity. AURIO includes the Associate Pro-Vice-Chancellor\\n (Research Integrity), the Research Integrity Manager and Research Integrity Officer. AURIO\\n works with Aston University Research Ethics Committee (UREC) to monitor and improve\\n institutional ethics policies and guidelines, and provides training and support for Researchers via\\n dedicated programmes (section 3.10). In 2020, Aston funded a Research Ethics Portal to\\n streamline the research ethics process.\\n 2.13 Aston is a signatory to DORA. The University’s Policy for the Responsible Use of Research\\n Publication Metrics (2020) reinforces the primacy of substantive peer review and recognises the\\n value that metrics can add to that process. Scival is used for reporting, benchmarking and\\n analysis of research indicators.\\n Structures to support an open research environment\\n 2.14 Our Open Research Data Policy (2019) highlights the requirement to maintain accurate and\\n retrievable data generated by research in order to open up data for scrutiny, to validate and\\n replicate research, and to re-use data. The Policy applies to all researchers, PGRs and\\n professional services staff supporting research data management. Evidence of progress towards\\n compliance with the Concordat on ORD is reported regularly to the URC.\\n                                                                                                     Page 5\\n\\n\\n 2.15 Aston’s Open Access (OA) Policy aligns with UKRI OA requirements for REF2021. Aston\\n provides comprehensive guidance on all aspects of OA, with specific expertise provided by the\\n Library’s Open Access and Research Repository Specialists, and Information Specialists.\\n 2.16 Aston has committed £370,000 to securing Gold Open Access since 2014. In 2020 Aston\\n decided to focus investment on the publishing element of new transformative/read and publish\\n contracts. Such contracts offer greater return on investment when compared to paying individual\\n Article Processing Charges for non-funded authors. To date Aston has contracts with eleven\\n publishers.\\n 2.17 99% of REF Category A staff have an ORCID iD.\\n      3. People\\n 3.1 In 2015, Aston moved to a standard model of permanent appointment with a three-year\\n probation period for Teaching and Research staff. Since then, the share of (T&R) staff on fixed-\\n term contracts has fallen from 35% to 2%. Aston has not used zero hours contracts during this\\n REF period.\\n 3.2 Aston’s academic recruitment since 2014/15 (Figure 3) demonstrates our commitment to\\n improving diversity (section 1.6). In 2021, we will consider anonymous shortlisting for our\\n academic recruitment processes.\\n 3.3 Promotion is one of the ways we reward and retain excellent staff and build a strong\\n community of academics, with 145 T&R colleagues promoted since 2014/15 (Table 5).\\n Promotion for Teaching and Research staff is based upon excellence in either Research, or\\n Teaching and Learning. On the Research route, the promotions criteria are explicitly aligned to\\n the Research Strategy (section 2.3).\\n                         Table 5: Academic promotions (2014-15 to 2019-20)\\n                                                         Total        Gender Breakdown\\n         Lecturer to Senior Lecturer                              77 60% M - 40% F\\n         Senior Lecturer to Reader                                44 57% M - 43% F\\n         Reader to Professor                                      24 63% M - 37% F\\n                                                                                             Page 6\\n\\n\\n Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI)\\n 3.4 Aston’s Diversity and Inclusion Strategy details our commitment to creating an inclusive\\n environment aligned with the broader Aston Mission (Figure 1). Data collection and analysis is\\n critical to the understanding of Aston’s EDI profile, informs discussions with staff and students,\\n and helps to identify areas of culture, policy, and practice which require improvement. The\\n Guardian 2020 University of the Year Award specifically highlighted Aston’s EDI programme\\n (section 1.2). We are striving to address our leaky pipeline and the lack of diversity (particularly\\n with respect to race), at senior levels. In 2020, we developed our LGBT+ Inclusion Charter and\\n we are working towards enhanced training and support with respect to disability.\\n 3.5 The EDI Strategy is operationalised through policies and procedures and diverse\\n membership of University Committees. The Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Forum (EDIF)\\n (Figure 4), consolidates eight active strands of activity across the University. EDIF reports to the\\n University Executive ensuring relevant activities align with management priorities and University\\n Strategy.\\n 3.6 EDIF works in parallel to the Gender Equality Project Management Group, which focuses on\\n the priorities of the Athena SWAN Charter. By 2025, we aim to eliminate our Gender Pay Gap of\\n 19.5% in 2020 by focusing on consistency of starting salary, and pay parity on promotion and\\n within professorial bands. Aston’s Pay Gap Working Group is looking at issues around the\\n relative lack of diversity at senior levels; developing anonymous recruitment processes focused\\n on skills-based assessment, and developing a pool of diversity and inclusion experts to support\\n recruitment panels. The College of Engineering and Physical Sciences’ excellent practice in this\\n area is recognised by its ATHENA Swan Silver award and is being adopted across the\\n University (Table 6).\\n               Table 6: Athena SWAN Awards                  Type of        Level\\n                                                            Award\\n      University                                            Institutional  Silver\\n      School of Engineering and Applied Science             Departmental Silver (Applying for\\n                                                                           Gold during 2021)\\n      School of Life and Health Sciences                    Departmental Bronze\\n      Aston Business School/Aston Law School                Departmental Applying for Bronze\\n      School of Languages and Social Sciences               Departmental Bronze\\n Staff Wellbeing\\n 3.7 Aston has a comprehensive suite of Health, Safety and Welfare policies, procedures and\\n guidance covering: Leave and Attendance (including the Parenting at Aston Scheme, Flexible\\n                                                                                                Page 7\\n\\n\\n Working, and Compassionate Leave); Wellbeing (including EDI, Work-Life Balance, Work-\\n Related Stress and Menopause); all aspects of Working at Aston. Staff have highlighted the\\n following as particularly valuable:\\n          i.   Since 2017, the cost of parental leave is no longer borne locally; instead, the\\n               University centrally funds up to a year of parental leave above statutory rates;\\n         ii.   Mental health/wellbeing resources that are reflected in our Workplace Wellbeing\\n               Charter accreditation;\\n        iii.   All staff employed for more than 26 weeks may apply for flexible working;\\n        iv.    All services, facilities, promotion and job opportunities are available to staff on\\n               extended leave;\\n         v.    Comprehensive support is offered to those taking extended leave for reasons of ill-\\n               health;\\n        vi.    Staff requiring periods of leave for caring may request part-time working, flexible\\n               hours, or take up to one-year unpaid leave;\\n       vii.    Formalised KIT and SPLIT days, re-induction processes and phased returns help\\n               colleagues returning from extended leave to re-establish careers;\\n       viii.   A robust Bullying and Harassment Policy.\\n Academic Career Development\\n 3.8 In 2018-19, My Development Conversation replaced the previous Performance Development\\n Review. This shifted the emphasis from biannual review to continuous dialogue, which is\\n particularly important regarding the professional development and employability opportunities of\\n fixed-term research-only staff. Through this process, colleagues agree targets for grant\\n applications, publications and public engagement activity. In 2017/18, the University opened the\\n promotions path up to Professorial level for both Research, and Teaching and Clinical staff.\\n 3.9 Mentoring networks offer a safe, informal environment for staff to discuss issues, and seek\\n guidance. All new staff and ECRs have at least one mentor, usually a senior colleague and we\\n have invested in PLD mentoring software. At senior levels, mentoring and coaching is arranged\\n on a personal basis, with some senior staff accessing mentors in other universities. The Culture,\\n Employment and Development in Academic Research Survey (CEDARS-2020) indicated that\\n 60% of respondents at Aston have a mentor, and that 58% of those with a mentor stated that the\\n relationship had a positive impact on career development.\\n 3.10 Aston’s staff development programmes are well established. All staff complete mandatory\\n training, including E&D Awareness, Unconscious Bias and General Data Protection Regulation\\n Awareness. Academic staff access continuing professional development, including ‘Introduction\\n to Learning and Teaching’ and the ‘PGDip in Academic Leadership’. Staff without a teaching\\n qualification must obtain this or an Advance HE Fellowship within 2 years of joining Aston. The\\n RKE team offers training geared to the research lifecycle (sections 2.9, 4.5). The Organisational\\n Development team provides training opportunities, including Executive Development, Change\\n Management, and The Institute of Leadership & Management programmes.\\n 3.11 Study Leave is managed at College level and is recognised as an essential element of a\\n research environment that prioritises excellence.\\n 3.12 Aston is a signatory of the Technician Commitment, a sector wide initiative led by the\\n Science Council, supported by the Gatsby Foundation to help address key challenges facing\\n technical staff. A technicians’ representative is a member of URC.\\n                                                                                                   Page 8\\n\\n\\n ECR Forum\\n 3.13 Aston maintains its commitment to the Concordat to Support the Career Development of\\n Researchers through regular reviews and updates of policies, practice and the Researcher\\n Development Programme. The HR Excellence in Research Award (2020) recognises this\\n institutional undertaking. Responsibility for the implementation of the Concordat rests with the\\n ‘HR Excellence in Research Award Group’, which is co-chaired by the ECR Facilitator and the\\n Dean of the Graduate School.\\n 3.14 The ECR Development Programme is managed by the Researcher Development Advisor\\n and Professional Development Advisor, both of whom are based in the Graduate School. It\\n includes formalised Career Development Planning and Training Needs Analysis, plus a wide\\n range of centrally managed courses (Knowledge and Intellectual Abilities, Personal\\n Effectiveness, Research Governance and Organisation, and Engagement Influence and Impact).\\n Elements of the annual Graduate School Training Programme are also open to ECRs.\\n Support of PGR students\\n 3.15 Formed in 2010, the Aston Graduate School (AGS) is a cross-university initiative, led by the\\n Associate PVC/Dean of the Graduate School. The Graduate School Management Committee\\n (GSMC) reports into Research Committee, ensures the quality of PGR-programmes across the\\n University, fosters interdisciplinary initiatives and supports PGR-student wellbeing. Thus, it has\\n had a considerable impact on the student experience and quality of the doctoral process.\\n 3.16 AGS has implemented standard processes and documentation for the PGR lifecycle, and\\n ensures quality standards for all research degree programmes. Overall responsibility for the\\n welfare of PGRs lies with the Colleges who own the PGR programmes. College Directors of\\n Research Degree Programmes are members of GSMC, thus ensuring that AGS has strong links\\n to the day-to-day running of all research degree programmes. All staff with supervision\\n responsibility are required to complete mandatory supervision training regardless of career\\n stage.\\n 3.17 The Graduate School Training Programme supports career development, both within\\n academia and beyond. PGRs receive a comprehensive AGS Handbook; attend the AGS and\\n College Inductions; undertake 90 hours of research skills training; and are invited to complete\\n the Introduction to Learning and Teaching Practice course delivered by the University’s\\n Education Team before undertaking any teaching. The AGS Training Programme is based on\\n the Vitae Researcher Development Framework and the training sessions align with the\\n Framework’s four domains. Funder specific requirements are met through training provision\\n offered by Colleges and the relevant UKRI doctoral training structures for each College.\\n 3.18 Aston Postgraduate Research Society (APRS) encourages collaboration between Colleges,\\n aiming to improve the social and academic experiences of Aston PGRs. APRS nominates\\n representatives to relevant committees within the University governance structure.\\n 3.19 The Centre for English Language and Communication at Aston offers training for students\\n and staff for whom English is not their first language.\\n      4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n Income\\n 4.1 The growth in academic faculty, coupled with the expansion of research support provision\\n has facilitated an increase in grant capture (£15m in 2013/14 to £30m in 2019/20) and research\\n income (£12.5m in 2013/14 to £17m in 2019/20). Record grant capture in 2018/19 and 2019/20\\n will underpin continued growth in research income.\\n                                                                                                Page 9\\n\\n\\n Facilities\\n 4.2 Since 2013/14, £25.55m of capital expenditure has been incurred against research project\\n codes, research cost centres and research estates projects in Aston’s areas of research\\n strength. Since 2018, this investment has aligned with the URIs (section 2.5) in order to\\n maximise return, for example £7.3m investment into 30 AIPT laboratories, supported by a £500k\\n Wolfson equipment grant, plus an additional £3m internal investment on equipment.\\n 4.3 The Midlands Innovation consortium equipment catalogue facilitates equipment sharing\\n between member universities. MI also enabled Aston to partner on successful cross HEI funding\\n applications (section 1.6)\\n Infrastructure (research, translation and impact)\\n 4.4 Aston’s research support infrastructure is led by the PVC Research and Executive Director\\n of Business Engagement. The RKE Department (section 4.4) includes 56 members of staff and\\n nine teams (Research Strategy, Funding and Impact; Graduate School; Research Integrity;\\n Knowledge Exchange; Business Engagement; Regional Strategy; Corporate Client Solutions;\\n and Research Marketing). Our support for research also includes teams in Finance, HR, Library\\n Services, Organisational Development, plus Research Managers and Administrators in\\n Colleges.\\n 4.5 During the REF period, the University Grant Writing Programme (organised by the Strategic\\n Funding Managers (SFMs)) has developed into a comprehensive course. The programme takes\\n 15 participants through the application process from initial idea to approval, including costing,\\n peer review and mock panels. As part of the Programme, we draw on the experience of senior\\n staff with a track-record of funding success to provide constructive feedback to participants. The\\n SFMs regularly run drop-in sessions to support all aspects of research funding.\\n 4.6 The Development and Alumni Relations Office (DARO) facilitates partnerships with third-\\n party organisations as well as managing philanthropic relationships with alumni. DARO works\\n with academics and SFMs to secure funding from charitable trusts with a focus on the URIs.\\n 4.7 To mark the University’s Golden Jubilee in 2016, the Aston University Prize Fund was\\n established to facilitate research. Between 2016-18, Aston matched funds 50:50 for 54 PhD\\n Studentships (£2.1m); six Research Fellows co-funded by external partners (£348k); and £120k\\n for International Research Scholarships.\\n 4.8 Aston has received £577k of Global Challenges Research Fund QR funding since 2018.\\n Funding supported collaborative initiatives with international partners. We have strengthened\\n collaborations leading to further competitive, collaborative awards, such as a Newton Fund\\n award with Indonesia, an UKRI/GCRF award and a Newton Prize nomination on nutrition in\\n Kenya.\\n 4.9 Aston has invested in systems that underpin our activity throughout the research lifecycle,\\n including:\\n      i.   Moving from pFACT and Agresso Awards Management to Agresso Research Costing\\n           and Pricing for the costing and management of research funding;\\n     ii.   Elsevier hosting of PURE for research information management;\\n    iii.   Subscriptions to Scival and ResearchProfessional;\\n   iv.     Dods Parliamentary Companion.\\n 4.10 Through our Knowledge Exchange Strategy, we aim to deliver economic growth,\\n productivity enhancement and social impact around five key themes: research and knowledge\\n transfer; degree apprenticeships and work-based learning; employability and entrepreneurship;\\n regional and civil engagement; business engagement.\\n                                                                                              Page 10\\n\\n\\n 4.11 Our work in Knowledge Exchange also tackles social and economic challenges, informs\\n and influences policy to foster a culture of evidence-based policymaking and will form the\\n foundation of our Civic University Agreement (2021). We work closely with regional bodies,\\n developing shared projects that benefit citizens, for example:\\n     i.   Raising awareness of the importance of eye health (Villa Vision initiative);\\n    ii.   Sustainable business growth and productivity (Unlocking Opportunity with the Federation\\n          of Small Businesses);\\n   iii.   Consultancy activities undertaken with SMEs; Aston is the most active university in the\\n          Midlands, and ninth in the UK (2018/19 HE-BCI data);\\n   iv.    EBRI working with Low-Carbon SMEs including, FuturEnergy Ltd and Modus Waste &\\n          Recycling;\\n    v.    Through the Citizens UK Birmingham Business Leaders Programme, colleagues in Aston\\n          Business School are supporting BAME enterprises to access Government via the\\n          COVID-19 Emergency Listening Campaign.\\n 4.12 We have invested in our internal support for a diverse range of industrial research\\n collaborations and translational research. Key posts are funded internally and through HEIF in\\n the Knowledge Exchange team, the Business Engagement team, and in Schools (including\\n Associate Deans Research and Impact Champions). In 2016, a Research Impact Manager was\\n recruited to develop systems and processes to identify, nurture and capture information on the\\n impact arising from Aston research; a full-time Impact Officer was added in 2019.\\n 4.13 Since 2018, an annual Impact Fund of £150K has been invested to accelerate data\\n collection for REF Impact Case Studies, and to support the development of a pipeline of more\\n than 200 potential impacts across the University. A range of training sessions, workshops,\\n group-based away days, and one-to-one consultations are delivered through RKE, AGS and the\\n ECR Forum to spread and embed best practice regarding the integration of impact into the\\n research process. Aston works closely with the Industry and Parliament Trust and The\\n Conversation to access training and support for developing researcher skills in engagement and\\n to communicate the outcomes of its research.\\n 4.14 Examples of our activities in translation and impact over this REF period include:\\n     i.   Match-funding to support a portfolio of 21 ERDF projects (total value over £10m);\\n    ii.

      "['Birkbeck, University of London\\n 1. Context and mission\\n Founded in 1823 to provide educational opportunities for working Londoners, Birkbeck,\\n University of London, has a long and proud tradition of opening up knowledge for the benefit of\\n society. Our mission has not changed and it rests on a foundation of expanding education and\\n professional/knowledge-based opportunities to all.\\n We are based in Bloomsbury and have over 12,000 students studying at every level from short\\n courses and certificates to Ph.D. Uniquely in the UK, the overwhelming majority of Birkbeck\\n students are studying in the evening, and a significant proportion do so part-time (2019/20: 52%\\n UG; 77% PGT; and 55% PGR). As a result, many are also in full, or part-time, employment.\\n Many Birkbeck students are from the Greater London area, and they reflect the social and\\n demographic profile of the city. In 2019/20, 57% of the student population were female, 41%\\n from BAME backgrounds with an average age on entry of 30 (UG); 33 (PGT) and 37 (PGR).\\n We are a world leading research-intensive university with a long tradition of engaging with\\n cultural, environmental, political, scientific, and social issues in new and innovative ways. We\\n make the results of our research available through research-led teaching (and through this to\\n employers across London), public dissemination, partnerships with other organisations of all\\n types, and the promotion of civic and public debate. There is no “one size fits all”, we tailor our\\n approach to the specific needs of our audience, routinely working with stakeholders including\\n employers, trade unions, local councils, NGOs and others to deliver our mission.\\n The College has five Schools (Arts; Business, Economics and Informatics (BEI); Law; Science;\\n and Social Science, History and Philosophy (SSHP)) and 19 Departments\\n (http://www.bbk.ac.uk/departments/) which make up the 15 Units of Assessment in our REF\\n submission. We cover the spectrum of arts, humanities and social and environmental/natural/life\\n sciences and some physical sciences but we do not have teaching or research in medicine or\\n engineering.\\n Birkbeck has a unique student body and an educational offer of the highest standards globally,\\n being ranked in the top 35% of higher education institutions in the QS World University\\n Rankings 2020 (including in the top 6% for its ability to attract international students from 116\\n countries). In the THE World Rankings 2020: Psychology and Arts and Humanities at the\\n College were ranked in the top 100 worldwide; Social Sciences in the top 250; and Business and\\n Economics in the top 300.\\n The department of Biological Sciences dates back to the foundation of the College and Helen\\n Gwynne-Vaughan, J.D. Bernal and Rosalind Franklin have all featured amongst its faculty.\\n Birkbeck’s department of Computer Science and Information Systems was founded in 1957,\\n making it one of the oldest world-wide. Birkbeck has been home to many distinguished scholars,\\n including Lillian Penson (the first person to be awarded a PhD in the University of London and\\n the first woman Vice-Chancellor of the University), Nikolaus Pevsner, the College’s first\\n Professor of Art History, and the former College president, Eric Hobsbawm. In 2020, Professor\\n Sarah Hart of our Economics, Mathematics and Statistics department was appointed the first\\n ever woman Gresham Professor in Geometry. Other departments reflect the changes of the last\\n 200 years through the emergence of new intellectual paradigms (Department of Psychosocial\\n Studies, established 2000) or the recognition that the College now has critical mass in an area\\n such as the Department of Criminology (established 2018).\\n 2. Strategy\\n Birkbeck’s current research strategy (see Our research — Birkbeck, University of London\\n (bbk.ac.uk)) is to maintain excellence across our broad range of disciplines, to ensure that all\\n                                                                                                 Page 1\\n\\n\\n staff have the freedom to develop their research, and to provide the highest quality training in all\\n our subject areas and at every stage of an academic career. Birkbeck’s commitment to\\n promoting equality and diversity amongst its researchers is deeply ingrained, as the careers of,\\n amongst others, Helen Gwynne-Vaughan (Head of Department 1909/Professor of Botany 1921)\\n or Lillian Penson demonstrate. The College seeks to draw maximum advantage from its central\\n London location to collaborate with neighbouring HEIs, research institutions and the scientific\\n and cultural resources of the capital.\\n  The five key aims articulated in our current research strategy are:\\n     •    Empowering individual researchers by providing time, resources, support and guidance;\\n     •    Ensuring that all researchers are valued, enjoy equal opportunities and can contribute,\\n          from early career to research leaders;\\n     •    Promoting collaborative research across disciplinary, institutional and geographic\\n          boundaries;\\n     •    Assuring that our research is of the highest ethical standards;\\n     •    Ensuring that excellent research and teaching are mutually reinforcing and beneficial for\\n          researchers and staff.\\n These aims remain fundamental to our future vision of providing the best possible support and\\n infrastructure for research. In addition, over the next census period we shall seek to:\\n     -    Build on our strong international collaborations and to consolidate and expand existing\\n          European networks post-Brexit;\\n     -    Grow research income and develop Knowledge Exchange through links with external\\n          partners;\\n     -    Maintain and strengthen our successful collaborations with DTP partners and further\\n          increase our PGR numbers;\\n     -    Further reinforce the equalities and diversity agendas in our research cultures;\\n     -    Ensure the dissemination, public awareness and benefit of our research outside of the\\n          HE sector.\\n Since 2014, Birkbeck has reinforced its research support and governance structures. In 2015,\\n the roles of PVC Research (PVC R) and Director of the Graduate School were combined into a\\n single full-time academic management role. That was followed by the appointment of the Head\\n of Research Strategy Support (HRSS) in 2016, and together they lead on the implementation of\\n the College Research Strategy through the College Research Committee and its sub-\\n committees and working groups.\\n The Research Strategy Group RSG) (established in 2015, chaired by PVC(R)) brings together\\n the Assistant Deans Research from the five Schools and acts as an executive for research\\n matters, while the Research Support Group (established in 2015, chaired by HRSS) directs the\\n research support activities of the central professional service departments. In addition, the REF\\n Working Party, Open Research Working Group, KEF Working Group and the Research Student\\n Sub-committee all report to the Research Committee for their respective areas of competence.\\n Birkbeck launched an autonomous Research Office in 2018 by combining support staff that had\\n previously formed part of the Finance Department, Secretariat, Registry or Schools and three\\n additional posts were approved in the new Research Office to address under-capacity issues.\\n Birkbeck’s current Impact Strategy (see Our research — Birkbeck, University of London\\n (bbk.ac.uk)) was approved in 2018.\\n The College first employed impact officers in each of the five schools in 2012, and in 2014 it took\\n the strategic decision to make these roles permanent in order to maintain an infrastructure that:\\n     -    monitors and promotes the applicability of the College’s research;\\n     -    provides academic staff with regular training and updates relating to knowledge\\n          exchange and the Impact agenda;\\n                                                                                               Page 2\\n\\n\\n      -   communicates our research to third parties;\\n      -   assists individual researchers and research groups to develop their impact strategies,\\n          identify partners and collect data about emerging impacts.\\n During the current REF cycle, the College has invested up to £10,000 per UoA in a targeted way\\n to promote impact-focused activities and to support the delivery of the REF2014 impact\\n templates in real time. Termly meetings between the impact officers and the PVC(R) were set up\\n capture this and feed into the revisions of the College’s impact and Research Strategies.\\n Success in embedding the impact agenda has been accompanied by the College’s commitment\\n to Public Engagement, which represents an investment of more than £300,000 over the census\\n period. Since 2014, the College has secured a Wellcome Institutional Strategic Support Fund\\n award, totalling £4.2 Million, including the match funding element, (Birkbeck is the one of very\\n few institutions without a Medical School to be in receipt of sufficient Wellcome funding to\\n receive this award) part of which was strategically directed towards the employment of a public\\n engagement manager and the development of public engagement training, prizes and awards.\\n The College also secured funding from the RCUK/UKRI SEE PER (Strategic support to Expedite\\n Embedding Public Engagement with Research) call to ensure that training and support for public\\n engagement was available more widely across disciplines. (EP/R019649/1, total award value\\n £95,674) Specialised training for PhD students was provided as a key part of this project, and\\n led to, for example, the launch of the Birkbeck Three-Minute thesis competition, which is now an\\n annual event.\\n RESEARCH INTEGRITY\\n Birkbeck is committed to maintaining the highest possible standards of research integrity which\\n is the responsibility of our College Ethics Committee. Chaired by an Executive Dean, it\\n comprises a representative from each School, a lay member (not employed by the College) as\\n well as representatives from our Professional Services departments and researchers (by\\n invitation) with expertise in Research Ethics. Each School also has an ethics committee to\\n review and approve ethics applications and to ensure suitable ethics and integrity training is\\n provided to departments, while the College Ethics Committee’s primary functions are to develop\\n and oversee our policies relating to research integrity, the ethical conduct of our activities and\\n research misconduct, and to provide a space for consideration of more substantive ethical\\n questions facing researchers such as the use of social media and the effective, confidential\\n preservation and reuse of qualitative datasets.\\n Our research misconduct procedure is the normal process by which we would expect questions\\n relating to lapses of research integrity to be raised, but the College also has a more general\\n whistleblowing process. Both of these procedures follow accepted sector norms as closely as\\n possible for our particular constituency. Relevant information is on the College’s website, and we\\n also provide these details in our annual statement on Research Integrity to the UK Research\\n Integrity Office.\\n OPEN RESEARCH\\n Birkbeck’s mission is an open knowledge mission, and thus the open access agenda is\\n something that resonates strongly within the institution. Birkbeck researchers have access to our\\n institutional open access repositories BIROn (outputs) and BIRD (data). We have been home to\\n the Open Library for the Humanities since 2014 and were one of the earliest UK signatories to\\n the DORA declaration on research assessment in 2017.\\n Birkbeck established the Open Access Working Group in 2014, reporting to the College\\n Research Committee. As the remit of the OAWG has expanded, this has led to a broadening of\\n its scope recognised by its renaming as College Open Research Working Group in 2018. The\\n group is tasked with considering questions relating to open access, open data and reproducibility\\n and has overseen the production of our research data management policy in 2016. The Group is\\n                                                                                                 Page 3\\n\\n\\n also tasked with maintaining up-to-date and accurate knowledge of any policies or developments\\n pertaining to open research, including but not limited to those relevant to the REF, and\\n disseminating these throughout the College.\\n NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH PRIORITIES\\n Responsibility for ensuring that staff are fully informed about international, UK and research\\n council policies and funding opportunities lies with the Research Office. Regular communication\\n is provided via tools such as Research Professional, training and one to one coaching and\\n invitations to outside funders to speak, including the Leverhulme Trust, the Wellcome Trust and\\n UKRI.\\n The Research Strategy Group complements and extends the work of the Research Office and\\n provides the necessary conduit between the Schools and the Centre.\\n National research priorities which have particular relevance to our constituency under the\\n industrial strategy sector deals are the Life Science deal and the creative industries deal. Much\\n of our research engages either directly or indirectly with the sustainable development goals.\\n INTERDISCIPLINARITY\\n As a small research-intensive institution with a broad disciplinary range, Birkbeck is committed to\\n interdisciplinary collaboration in order to maximise the opportunities and resources at its\\n disposal.\\n In order to facilitate cooperation, the College has over forty active research Centres and\\n supports eight recognised Institutes including the Birkbeck Institute for Data Analytics (BIDA),\\n the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities (BIH); the Birkbeck Institute for the Moving Image\\n (BIMI); the Institute for Structural and Molecular Biology (ISMB); and the Birkbeck Institute for\\n Social Research (BISR). Since 2014, the College has invested more than £1.5m in supporting\\n the work of its Institutes.\\n Each of the research Institutes has a distinct mission, but BIDA, BIH, BIMI and BISR are\\n specifically tasked with supporting Birkbeck’s internal research environment and are directed by\\n steering groups representing all five schools as well as early career academics and doctoral\\n students, overseen by the PVC(R). A commitment to interdisciplinary research forms part of their\\n respective terms of reference and is reflected in their activities which include annual visiting\\n Fellowship schemes, summer schools, conferences, workshops, and public lectures and film\\n screenings.\\n A similar interdisciplinary ethos permeates Birkbeck’s research centres\\n http://www.bbk.ac.uk/research/centres/. These activities are driven by the interests of our\\n academics. Unlike some HEIs, Birkbeck has deliberately chosen not to identify specific research\\n themes to shape its strategy. Instead, we remain determined to encourage excellence wherever\\n it is to be found in line with our research strategy which seeks to create an environment where\\n innovation and ‘blue sky’ thinking, can prosper.\\n New Centres established during the current REF cycle include the Centre for Museum Cultures,\\n the Centre for Political Economy and Institutional Studies and the Building Resilience in Breast\\n Cancer Centre. For a new Centre to be approved its sponsors need to convince the College\\n Research Committee that it has a cross-institutional remit, a coherent and innovative research\\n agenda and the necessary critical mass in terms of active members. It is also expected that to\\n be sustainable a Centre will address a number of key issues that might include, but are not\\n limited to, plans for seeking research grants, the dissemination of research findings through\\n publications and other outputs, academic exchange both nationally and internationally and the\\n development of doctoral and early career researchers.\\n                                                                                                 Page 4\\n\\n\\n COLLABORATIONS, NETWORKS and PARTNERSHIPS\\n Birkbeck takes full advantage of its geographical position in central London to build active\\n research collaborations with a range of non-HEI partners, including museums, practitioners,\\n activists and other organisations as well as other members of the University of London and the\\n Schools of Advanced Study.\\n Over an extended period the College has maintained active research partnerships with its close\\n neighbour, UCL, in relevant STEM subjects (see section 4. Below). Biological and Earth and\\n Planetary Sciences are particularly closely integrated with UCL and have jointly appointed staff\\n and shared state-of-the-art, laboratories and equipment (some of which has been renewed in\\n this census period). Both have made joint returns to this and previous REF/RAE. There is also\\n close collaboration and some equipment sharing between our Psychological Sciences\\n Department and UCL but on a smaller scale.\\n Birkbeck is also closely integrated with the other University of London Colleges through Doctoral\\n Training Partnerships including BBSRC (BBK, UCL, RVC, QMUL, LSHTM, KCL, Royal\\n Holloway, Greenwich, Unilever, Kew, Animal and plant health agency); ESRC (BBK, LSHTM,\\n SOAS, UCL, UEL); MRC (UCL) and the NERC (Brunel, QM, Royal Holloway, KCL, Institute of\\n Zoology, Natural History Museum, and UCL). Birkbeck is not, however, exclusively London\\n focused as its decision to join the CHASE AHRC DTP, headed by the University of Sussex and\\n including the universities of Essex, Kent, and East Anglia demonstrates.\\n International research collaborations are apparent across every UoA in Birkbeck, and the\\n College has joint externally funded research projects with international partners such as the\\n Open Society University Network (OSUN) of which Birkbeck is an Educational partner,\\n https://osun.bard.edu/. OSUN has provided scholarships for students from its partner\\n organisations and the global south to attend our annual Critical Theory Summer School hosted\\n by the BIH.\\n Birkbeck has also developed collaborations at institutional level, including a partnership with\\n New York University (NYU) to share facilities and develop research collaborations. As part of\\n that initiative Birkbeck and NYU are jointly funding an annual research fund of £50k for three\\n years in the first instance, which offers grants to further scholarly activity that will deepen\\n research collaborations between the two universities. Recipients of these grants can use their\\n awards for travel and other expenses related to annual lectures, conferences, workshops, faculty\\n exchanges or meetings for \"works in progress\" between the two universities.\\n 3. People\\n Birkbeck encourages all academic staff to participate actively in research.\\n The College Research strategy is to appoint the best researchers in their field and to offer them\\n the facilities and opportunities to develop their work and pursue their ideas and ambitions.\\n Success is valued and recognised at every level and review processes are pro-actively used to\\n support career ambitions.\\n The College recognises that research requires dedicated time away from other academic\\n responsibilities and it is committed to providing research leave and to encouraging academics to\\n gain research grants that allow them to pursue their work. All academic staff are entitled to one\\n term’s Study Leave after the completion of nine terms of service.\\n Birkbeck has a formal Flexible Working Policy but as the overwhelming majority of Birkbeck\\n classes take place in the evening, between 6-9 pm, longstanding formal and informal\\n mechanisms are in place to allow employees to request a change to their working hours and\\n how work is to be carried out between home and the office (where appropriate). In addition, a\\n                                                                                                 Page 5\\n\\n\\n Workplace Wellbeing Steering Group was launched in the 2018/19 academic year to develop\\n workplace wellbeing priorities for the College and to identify how these might be delivered.\\n CAREER PATHWAYS\\n Career pathways for academic staff are articulated through the academic contractual framework,\\n to ensure these are clear and transparent (actively rewarding research excellence) and the\\n implementation of a departmentally agreed workload allocation models.\\n All academic and research staff are required to participate in an annual review\\n process (including those on a fixed term contract of at least a year) to support career\\n planning over a ca. 3-year timeline and to provide a forum to discuss related support and\\n development.\\n All research active members of staff have the right to a mentor, who will discuss individual\\n research plans, giving guidance and support in developing and managing research projects and\\n producing appropriate publications. In the case of early career researchers, the provision of a\\n mentor and regular meetings is a requirement placed on departments as a vital aspect of career\\n development.\\n Early career researchers\\n Birkbeck believes that early career researchers sustain and renew its research community.\\n Having identified ECRs as a strategic priority, the College has, since 2016, taken a more\\n strategic approach to all major calls from the Research Councils and other external funders of\\n post-doctoral fellowships, advertising nationally for applicants and running internal selection\\n competitions.\\n The success of the approach is demonstrated by the example of the Leverhulme Trust Early\\n Career Fellowships scheme which requires institutions to provide 50% salary costs which means\\n it is important that these fellows are recruited in strategically important areas. The College has\\n invested over £325k in the four rounds of the competition since this process was introduced,\\n securing success rates well in excess of the national average (33%-60% against ~20%\\n nationally), and we have noticed a trend of some applicants that we have selected withdrawing\\n partway through the process following job offers from highly prestigious global institutions, which\\n is a testament to the calibre of the candidates we attract. The success of this approach has led\\n to it being extended to the British Academy Fellowships and UKRI Future Leaders Fellowships\\n schemes with a College wide selection and interview process for supported candidates. In the\\n first round of the FLF scheme, Birkbeck’s department of History, Classics and Archaeology was\\n the only Department in the country to have two successful applications.\\n As part of the £4.2M Wellcome ISSF award, £1.5 million has been invested in schemes that\\n specifically support early career researchers or those returning from a career break, with an\\n additional £1.5 million supporting PhD students for a further 6 months post submission – so 70%\\n of this very large award has been spent directly supporting our ECRs and those returning from a\\n career break.\\n Research students\\n Birkbeck has invested in excess of £2 million per annum in PhD Studentships since 2014 across\\n all disciplinary areas, including our Diversity 100 Scholarships which were launched across the\\n five Schools in 2019 and are ringfenced for BAME candidates.\\n Following the outcome of REF 2014, Birkbeck took the decision to commission a major review of\\n its PGR provision and the subsequent report provided 75 recommendations for the relaunch of\\n the BGRS (http://www.bbk.ac.uk/research/bgrs/). These recommendations have all been fully\\n actioned and implemented and the appointment of a new, full-time professional manager has\\n                                                                                                Page 6\\n\\n\\n enabled the BGRS to act as the central focus for generic training and all stages of the PGR\\n journey.\\n BGRS has an interdisciplinary PGR steering group with representatives from every School and\\n department and PhD students are regarded as vital contributors to the research community and\\n all Institutes and Centres are expected to have them as members.\\n Equality and diversity\\n The College holds the HR Excellence in Research Award, which recognises its progress towards\\n the implementation of the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. We\\n also hold an institutional Athena SWAN Bronze award (alongside several School/Departmental\\n awards; the College has adopted a formal timetable for all Schools/Departments to\\n achieve/maintain their Athena SWAN awards by 2028).\\n To advance equality and diversity, Birkbeck is also:\\n      •    a Mindful Employer,\\n      •    a Disability Confident Employer,\\n      •    a Stonewall Diversity Champion\\n      •    a Race Equality Charter member.\\n We also run the annual Aurora and Stellar HE mentoring programmes for women and BAME\\n staff respectively and strongly support the work of our Staff Diversity Networks: the Staff\\n Disability Network; a LGBT+ staff network (OutatBirkbeck); the BAME staff network (Race,\\n Equality and Cultural Heritage (REACH) network); and a Parents Network. A carers network is in\\n development in response to the covid pandemic.\\n The College Equality and Diversity Committee supports and champions equality and diversity\\n across the College – its members are from all Schools and include student and Trade Union\\n representatives. An Assistant Dean (Equalities) has been appointed within each academic\\n school to lead on equality and diversity issues, supporting the embedding of institutional and\\n local equality initiatives such as training in equality & diversity and unconscious bias\\n Over this census period, the Equality and Diversity Committee has used an Equality Action Plan\\n to monitor the progress of the delivery of its Equality Objectives.\\n In addition to the publication of its annual statutory Gender Pay Gap Report since 2017, the\\n College undertakes periodic Equal Pay Audits to measure the impact of equality and diversity\\n initiatives. It shows that that there are very few significant gaps in pay.\\n 4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n During the current REF cycle, Birkbeck has made significant progress in growing its external\\n income. All Schools and departments have active research grants and the total value of the\\n College Research Grant portfolio has risen from £45m in 2013/14 to £53m in 2019/20, an 18%\\n increase over the period.\\n In order to ensure that each department/UoA has the opportunity to maximise research grant\\n income, the Research Strategy Group is responsible for reviewing policies for staff mentoring\\n and ensuring that rigorous peer review is compulsory for applicants. Only grants which have\\n been signed off by the relevant Executive Dean are eligible for submission. The impact of these\\n changes is reflected in College achieving a 36% success rate for applications submitted in 2018-\\n 19, a more than 10% increase in overall College success rates over the census period up to the\\n 2018/19 academic year (the last year where full data is available, provisional data for 2019/20\\n suggest this has been maintained).\\n                                                                                              Page 7\\n\\n\\n The Wellcome ISSF scheme has been hugely beneficial to the development of research in\\n health and the medical humanities and that model was behind another strategic initiative to\\n establish a Research Innovation Fund in 2018 which provides seed funding for projects from\\n academics working in areas not eligible for Wellcome funding. Two funding streams are\\n supported (early career/returning from a career break, and seed funding for new projects) across\\n Birkbeck. A total of £92,306 has been awarded by this scheme so far.\\n Research Infrastructure and Collaborations with External Partners\\n Thanks to its central London location, Birkbeck offers its researchers easy access to some of the\\n world’s finest library, archival and material resources including the British museum, British library\\n and Senate House library. In addition, the College library has invested over £3.5m in journal\\n subscriptions in every year of this REF cycle. The library also received a strategic investment of\\n £1.3m to upgrade facilities in 2019.\\n The College has demonstrated its commitment to providing the highest quality research\\n infrastructure by investing in state-of-the-art instrumentation and facilities with technicians as\\n permanent staff, examples include:\\n The Birkbeck cryo EM lab, established by Professor Helen Saibil in 1990, is a major structural\\n biology facility, with 5 microscopes including 2 high end systems, and an outstanding\\n international reputation for research and training. Birkbeck and UCL have approved matching\\n funds for an application for a Glacios screening microscope that will speed up screening of\\n biological samples and grid conditions.

      "['Liverpool John Moores University\\n1. Context and Vision\\nHistory and Mission: Liverpool John Moores University’s (LJMU) vision is to be recognised as\\na “modern civic university delivering solutions to the challenges of the 21st century”. This holds\\ntrue to our founding philosophy when in 1823 the Liverpool Mechanics’ Institute and College of\\nArts, LJMUs forerunner, committed to education “as a positive lever for lasting social change”.\\nResearch and knowledge exchange (RKE) is a core pillar of the University’s strategic framework\\nand means we have a clear focus on the creation, dissemination and translation of new\\nknowledge. This enables LJMU to make a difference, change lives and impact local, national\\nand international partners.\\nSize and Structure: In 2019/20, 23,900 students were studying at LJMU (Liverpool) with\\nanother 2,900 on LJMU programmes overseas. LJMU has five academic faculties (Arts,\\nProfessional and Social Sciences; Business and Law; Engineering and Technology; Health;\\nScience), with 1,100 academic staff delivering a diverse taught undergraduate and postgraduate\\nportfolio as well as supervising >700 postgraduate research (PGR) students. Dedicated RKE\\nadministration staff in Faculties as well as in professional service teams (Research and\\nInnovation Services, Finance, Library Services, Leadership Development Foundation, n=60)\\nprovide further support.\\nTeaching, Research and Knowledge Exchange Balance: LJMU is a “large-sized” University\\nwith a mixed academic portfolio, where HESA-reported research grants, contract and quality-\\nrelated (QR) income represent 7% (£15.7m) of total income. LJMU is committed to an inclusive\\nRKE culture, that both informs and infuses our curriculum. The individual balance between\\nteaching and RKE activity is determined by a mature workload allocation model.\\nResearch Development, Maturity and Diversity (Disciplinary Spread): Heterogeneous RKE\\nactivity matches our curriculum portfolio. Sixteen units of assessment (UOAs) are submitted to\\nREF2021 across all Main Panels (A: 20%; B: 30%; C: 34%; D: 16% staff). Our largest\\nsubmissions are to UOA3 (72.4FTE) and UOA24 (63.25FTE). LJMU has participated in all\\n“research assessments” since 1992 with substantial maturity in our “Institutes” and “Centres”\\n(Table 1).\\nReflecting an evolving research culture (identity, critical mass, environment), first-time\\nsubmissions in “Psychology, Psychiatry & Neuroscience” and “Law” occurred in 2014. In 2021,\\ntwo new UOAs “Earth Systems & Environmental Sciences (UOA7)” and “Business &\\nManagement Studies” (UOA17) demonstrate further expansion and maturity of our RKE\\nportfolio. This reflects strategic investment and structural re-organisation (UOA7 incorporates\\nFTE in biological anthropology, returned to the Anthropology UOA in 2008/14).\\n\\n\\nTable 1.

LJMU is\\nembedded in the governance and activity of multiple regional bodies (e.g. LCR Combined\\nAuthority, Liverpool Health Partners, Innovation Agency) where collaborative RKE addresses\\nlocal socio-economic issues, a historic skills gap and health inequalities (exemplar projects in\\nsections 2 and 4). Our RKE “Beacons of Excellence” (Table 1) reflect Liverpool’s heritage as a\\nglobal port, an international sport city and a world-renowned cultural hub, with collaborative\\npartners as diverse as Shell UK Ltd, Liverpool Football Club and Tate Modern.\\nAffiliations and Peer Group: LJMU is an unaffiliated University, within TRAC Peer Group C\\nand Knowledge Exchange Framework (KEF) Cluster E. Alignment is indicative of our size,\\nbreadth of our discipline portfolios across both STEM and non-STEM subjects, and generation of\\nresearch funding from government bodies/hospitals and industry.\\nSummary: In REF2021 we have submitted 57% of eligible academic staff to sixteen UOAs. This\\nreflects significant growth that is not solely due to changes in the REF framework but is\\nattributed to cultural change and a strategy to grow RKE capability.\\n 2. Strategy\\n 2.1 LJMU Strategy for Research and Enabling Impact\\nOur Strategic Plan (2017-2022) committed LJMU to engage in “world-class RKE across\\ndisciplines” producing impact through “delivering solutions to the challenges of the 21st century”.\\nImpactful RKE with translation arises from effective partnerships and evaluation of key\\n                                                                                               Page 2\\n\\n\\nperformance indicators (KPIs). Statements below reflect the Strategic Plan period, unless\\notherwise stated.\\n    1) RKE is central to the development of all academic staff (KPI: increase in staff submitted\\n          to REF2021; increase number staff with PhD; increase total research outputs).\\n    2) Support areas of world leading RKE (KPI: support growth in “Beacons of Excellence”;\\n          increase the number of Research Institutes or Centres).\\n    3) Increase collaborations with key stakeholders to promote impact (KPI: increase RKE\\n          funding; grow collaborative research with overseas partners).\\n    4) Grow and nurture our PGR community (KPI: increase PGR numbers; launch the Doctoral\\n          Academy).\\n 2.1.1 RKE and Impact 2014-2020 (Achievement, Enablers)\\nKPI 1 Achievements: Positive trajectories in all KPIs reflect the continual development of a\\nfacilitative research culture at LJMU. REF staff submission guidelines have changed but we\\ncontend that our increased submission (REF2014: 256 headcount, 242.56FTE, 26%; REF2021\\n604 headcount, 583.56FTE, 57%) reflects a significant cultural shift. In addition, the proportion of\\nstaff with PhDs has increased (47% to 53%) in the last 4 years and annual research output\\nproduction has increased from 1,217 (2017) to 1,457 (2020).\\nEnablers: Targeted recruitment of staff, with PhD and RKE activity as essential criteria, has\\nsupported cultural change. New staff have a three-year induction, protected research time\\nallocation, mentorship schemes, resource support (seed corn funding), support for early career\\nresearchers (ECR; studentships, collaboration-development) and resources for interdisciplinary\\nresearch across faculties (studentships). LJMU run an award-winning staff researcher\\ndevelopment programme (“ACTivator”), a University-wide “Research Café” programme as well\\nas being a signatory to the revised Researcher Development Concordat.\\nKPI 2 Achievements: We have world-leading Research Institutes in Sport and Exercise\\nSciences (12th/300+ in 2020 Shanghai Global Rankings in Sport Sciences, one of three from the\\nUK in the top 50) and the Astrophysics Research Institute (two ERC Fellowships, two UKRI-\\nFuture Leadership Fellowships, 50% of outputs citations in the top 10% of journals). LJMU\\nhosts a further 10 Research Institutes including three which have been awarded since 2014\\n(Research Institute for Literature and Cultural History; Institute of Art and Technology; Public\\nHealth Institute – which hosts the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Violence\\nPrevention).\\nEnablers: A strategic decision to support research excellence and broader cultural development\\nhas seen all core Quality-Related (QR) funding to LJMU returned to the faculty that “earned” it to\\ncover staff and other research costs, such as capital developments and PGR recruitment. The\\nUniversity has committed significant resources to on-going “marquee” infrastructure plans,\\nincluding support for a new robotic telescope (4.0m) run by the Astrophysics Research Institute\\nbased in the Canary Islands, and a new applied Sport Science facility in the heart of the city\\ncentre. Direct distribution of Research Capital Investment Fund (RCIF) to faculties supports\\ninvestment.\\n                                                                                              Page 3\\n\\n\\nKPI 3 Achievements: HESA-reported RKE income has grown by 13% to £10m at year-end\\n2019/20. Our RKE portfolio has partnership at the core of project development including, for\\nexample, a growing number of “Knowledge Transfer Partnerships” (Innovate UK). Collaborations\\nwith overseas partners have grown and a sector-leading 67% of outputs (2019/20) are co-\\nauthored with international partners (2019/20).\\nEnablers: LJMU is immersed in LCR governance (innovation and growth boards) and has\\ncollaborative partnerships with local, regional, national and international public and private\\nenterprises We support individual and group collaboration via staffing resources (Business\\nDevelopment Officers; Impact Officer), digital resources (“Living Walls”; impact tracker software)\\nand financial resource (£250k per annum to impact projects; overseas collaborative\\n“fellowships”; “Impact Awards”).\\nKPI 4 Achievements: Postgraduate student numbers have grown from 437 in 2013/14 to >700\\nin 2019/20 and completions have risen from 65 in 2013/14 to 149 in 2019/20. Importantly we\\nhave sought to increase the quality of student intakes and their experiences, through a range of\\ninternal funding and development schemes, employing enrolment windows and engaging in\\nDoctoral Training Programmes (Applied Biosciences DTA; Cofund Scheme EU-Horizon2020\\nAgeing and Health).\\nEnablers: LJMU launched its Doctoral Academy (DA) in 2017 and an on-line PhD manager\\nportal (eDoc) in 2019. We have reviewed regulatory policies, supported a new PGR\\ndevelopment programme, and provided structured training for supervisors. LJMU has offered VC\\nscholarships (138 since 2014), match-funded studentships with external partners (45 since\\n2014) as well as cross-faculty studentships for identified research priorities (Drone applications;\\nInstitute for Health Research). Recruitment has been bolstered by growth in Doctorate in\\nBusiness Administration (DBA) numbers (16 in 2013/14; 46 in 2019/20) and 6 new Professional\\nDoctorate programmes since 2013/14 (143 students 2019/20).\\n 2.1.2 Strategic Research Plans for the next 5 Years (2021-2026)\\nGoal 1 Targets:\\n     a) Increase the proportion of research active staff from 57% to 62% (2026).\\n     b) Increase the proportion of staff with a PhD from 53% to 60% (2026).\\n     c) Increase the volume of research outputs from 1,500 per year to 1,600 (2026).\\nEnabler Plans: We will continue to prioritise RKE and PhD completion within recruitment\\nprocesses, whilst developing materials to demonstrate research opportunities and support to\\npotential candidates. We will retain the protected research allocation for new staff as well as\\nother academic and financial support options. Where relevant we will support staff to undertake\\na PhD by publication with experienced mentors. We will extend internal award and reward\\n(incentivisation) for staff engaged in RKE.\\nGoal 2 Targets:\\n     a) Confer 2 new Research Institutes before 2026.\\n     b) Increase output citation impact from 22% to 25% (top 10% citation percentiles) by 2026.\\nEnabler Plans: Targeted Research Centres will be supported to develop critical mass and key\\nmarkers of success (outputs, funding, PGR completions), and attain Research Institute status.\\n                                                                                               Page 4\\n\\n\\nCandidates include the Centre for Educational Research and the Centre for the Study of Crime,\\nCriminalisation and Social Exclusion. We will recognise growing activity with external partners\\n(Liverpool Centre for Cardiovascular Sciences) with formal affiliation. We will expand our staff\\ndevelopment offer, including bespoke sessions for priority areas and targeted external\\nstakeholders. In areas of excellence we will support applications for partnership-based Doctoral\\nTraining Programmes to grow critical mass, extend collaborations, promote interdisciplinarity, as\\nwell as acting as a stimulus to grow external grant submissions and produce excellent outputs.\\nWe will continue to support our “Beacons of Excellence” with strategic capital investment and\\nnon-pay resource support (e.g. QR distribution).\\nGoal 3 Targets:\\n    a) Increase total RKE income from £12.4m to £14m by 2026.\\n    b) Increase collaborative partnerships with routes to impact (develop KTP portfolio from 10\\n        to 15) by 2026.\\n    c) Maintain sector-leading collaborative research outputs with overseas partners.\\nEnabler Plans: As a signatory to the UUK Knowledge Exchange Concordat we will focus on\\nbuilding capacity and impact. Targeted support for new and existing staff will promote\\ninteraction with regional/national organisations, business and funders via Knowledge Exchange\\nNetwork activities (“Coffee and Croissant” online creative exchanges). The Liverpool Business\\nSchool has significant recent success with Management KTPs. We will harness our regional\\nassets such as Liverpool Knowledge Quarter to create collaborative opportunities and open new\\nfunding streams. Our strategic focus will be informed by local and national Industrial Plans,\\n“Grand Challenges” or Innovation and Growth activity. We will provide resource for development\\nof exceptional international collaborations (travel grants; ECR fellowships) with a plan for high-\\nquality outputs and global grant capture.\\nGoal 4 Targets:\\n    a) Increase our PGR community from 739 to 900 by 2026.\\nEnabler Plans: Fully and match-funded LJMU scholarships will continue alongside a new,\\nbespoke programme of support for external grant applications for PGR students requiring match-\\nfunding. A strategic focus will be partnership-based Doctoral Training Programmes via internal\\nand external funding streams. The DA will refresh our PhD by Publication offer and extend the\\nportfolio of Professional Doctorate programmes to develop collaboration with practice-based\\nresearchers. The recent addition of a PhD by Distance Learning will grow international activity as\\nglobal digital communications and climate change agendas develop. There will be planned\\ngrowth in Dual PhD programmes and Split Site awards with international collaborators.\\n 2.2 LJMU Open Research Environment\\nThe University’s Open Access (OA) Policy promotes ‘Green’ OA via our publications repository\\n(2014). Library Services manage the workflow and the repository currently holds 11,052 items of\\nwhich 1,423 are PhD theses (including all pre-2013 digitised LJMU theses from the British\\nLibrary). Ninety percent of all repository items are not subject to publisher or author embargo\\nand our thesis collection has had over 400,000 downloads. LJMU has an annual UKRI Open\\nAccess Block Grant allocation which supports article processing charges (including whole-cost\\n                                                                                               Page 5\\n\\n\\ncharges, e.g. IEEE and PLoS), institutional subscriptions to discounted publisher agreements,\\nand has part-funded three OA monographs. In support of Plan S the University reviews all “read\\nand publish” offers with agreements signed with Taylor and Francis, Cambridge University\\nPress, Sage, Wiley, Springer, RSC, Portland Press, Microbiology Society, IOP and Company of\\nBiologists. Library Services manage LJMU’s data repository workflows (2017), deliver advocacy\\nand training to promote open access to research data and support Data Management Plan\\npreparation in any external grant application. The University’s Data Management Policy is\\nunderpinned by the FAIR principles and the UKRI Concordat on Open Research Data. To\\nprovide staff and PGRs first-hand experience of the publishing process, LJMU Open Journals\\nService was established (2016) using Open Journal Systems to support the end-to-end\\npublishing process. This service supports home-grown LJMU journals including PRISM with\\n3,000 article downloads and 5,000 views since 2019.\\n 2.3 Research Integrity and Governance\\nThe application of the highest levels of research integrity are central to the LJMU Code of\\nPractice for Research (updated 2020) and the Code of Practice for Alleged Misconduct in\\nResearch. LJMU acts in accordance with the revised Concordat to Support Research Integrity\\n(2019). Standards and institutional expectations (e.g. ethics, data management) are included in\\nroutine training for staff and PGRs. No formal allegations or investigations of research\\nmisconduct have been conducted at LJMU since 2014. LJMU became a signatory to the San\\nFrancisco Declaration on Research Assessment (2019) to further promote good research\\npractice. The University Research Ethics Committee (UREC) ensures all research involving\\nhuman participants, or their data, safeguards the dignity, rights, health, safety and privacy of\\nthose involved. UREC handles 350-400 applications from staff and PGR per year. UREC\\nincludes staff from all academic areas conducting research on humans or their data, PGRs and\\nindividuals external to LJMU. UREC experience and expertise is regularly reviewed and annual\\ntraining is provided. An online research ethics module is available for all and mandatory for\\nPGRs. Staff and PGRs can attend research ethics workshops (ACTivator). LJMU sponsors\\nresearch (20-30 per year) in accordance with the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social\\nCare Research.\\n 3. People\\nStaffing Strategy: LJMU attracts high quality staff, supports them to succeed and recognises\\ntheir contribution. Recruitment emphasises completion of Doctoral level qualification and a\\nstrong RKE track-record. Just prior to, and at the beginning of the current REF period, LJMU\\nran an “INSPIRE” global recruitment drive that appointed 58 high-quality senior and ECR staff\\nthat provide leadership and promotes cultural change. On-going recruitment over the REF cycle\\nhas included support for strategic RKE areas. Additionally, LJMU has committed to the career\\npathway of staff holding prestigious, externally funded post-doctoral fellowships, via permanent\\nacademic appointment.\\nSupport and development are vital to promote staff retention. New staff appointments have a\\nprotected research workload allocation (3 years) as well as a 3-year induction support\\n                                                                                               Page 6\\n\\n\\nprogramme through the Leadership & Development Foundation that is supported by annual\\nappraisal and research Group/Centre/Institute membership. Local resource has been provided\\nby faculty ring-fenced PGR studentships for ECR. LJMU resource supports a “Research\\nUpskilling and Coaching” programme (93 mentors and mentees 2018/20) and a “Collaborative\\nResearch Fellowship Scheme” (34 staff) to visit and develop work programmes with prestigious\\ninstitutions (e.g. Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics).\\nSupport for mid-career staff towards promotion and leadership roles is vital. Staff have access to\\ntraining and development opportunities through LJMU’s award winning “ACTivator” programme\\n(Staff Development Forum 2019 Developing Excellent Practice Award). Staff have amassed\\n1,100 registrations across 82 events since 2016. This constantly evolving programme covers\\nactivities such as successful funding strategies, stakeholder engagement, evidencing impact,\\nmedia training, on-line engagement, public engagement and “writing retreats”.\\nLJMU is an established signatory (2013) to the Manifesto for Public Engagement, symbolising\\nour robust links with the National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement. The University\\nengages with the Civic University Network (2020) and has formally signed up to the pledge “to\\nform a Civic University Agreement”. The importance of “Place” in our strategic development will\\ncontinue to refine, develop and optimise our strong cultural, arts, creative, economic and sports-\\nbased connections within the Liverpool City Region.\\nLJMU employs 124 research-only staff who are incorporated into research\\nGroups/Centres/Institutes, undergo annual appraisal, and have access to training and\\ndevelopment opportunities. LJMU became a signatory (2020) to the Revised Concordat to\\nSupport the Career Development of Researchers and we hold an HR Excellence in Research\\nAward (since 2012).\\nLJMU’s staffing strategy includes recognition and reward. An annual LJMU RKE conference\\nincludes various awards with the highest accolade being the VC Medal for Research, provided to\\nthe individual, or group, demonstrating excellence in research. A VC medal for Knowledge\\nExchange (formally Economic and Social Engagement) is awarded for excellence in the\\ntranslation of research. The University also awards an annual “Spotlight Award” (£20K) following\\na “Dragons Den” style bid and discussion process to pump primes exciting RKE ideas. LJMU\\nproudly nominates exceptional staff or teams for external recognition; our Research Institute for\\nSport & Exercise Sciences received the TAFISA (International Sport for All Association) Mission\\nAcademia Award in 2019 for development of the Global Active City Programme (see REF5b\\nUOA24). FaceLab (see REF5b UOA32) was awarded ‘Research Team of the Year’ 2019 in the\\nEducate North Awards.\\nInstitutional Support for Equality, Diversity & Inclusivity: LJMU support the belief that “each\\nperson is respected equally” and that “diversity is embraced”. We promote and celebrate\\ndiversity, and inclusive practices are embedded across the University. We continually review\\nour internal EDI data to reflect on activity and identify key targets for change. LJMU has\\nsuccessfully renewed our Athena Swan Bronze Award (2018) with the University committed to\\nmaking a Silver Award application and a Race Equality Charter application in July 2021. Internal\\n                                                                                             Page 7\\n\\n\\nEDI data identified low numbers of female staff in senior RKE roles, reflecting historically lower\\nlevels of Readership and Professorship applications. Several positive actions have been\\nsupported at University level. Female staff are funded to participate in the Aurora Programme\\n(64 since 2013/14). One staff member recalls “Attending Aurora helped open my eyes to\\nleadership opportunities and what ‘good’ leadership looked like”. We exceeded EDI targets in\\nthe 2019/20 promotion round with 5 female Professorships conferred (5 applications) and 10\\nfemale Readerships conferred (21 applications). The Women’s Academic Network and sub-\\ngroups (Women Professors Network) provide bespoke support via mentorship, group-based\\ntraining and development events, as well as advocacy with LJMU senior management. Internal\\nEDI data analysis confirmed LJMU has limited representation of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic\\n(BAME) staff in RKE leadership positions (2; EDI Annual Report 2019). The launch of the BAME\\nStaff Network (2018) provides career progression advice, mentoring and advocacy and has over\\n200 members (academic and professional services). LJMU launched a reciprocal mentoring\\nprogramme (2020) with 10 BAME Staff participating, providing advice on career progression.\\nIn line with our Code of Practice for Research (2014) individual staff circumstances have been\\ntaken into consideration during Reader and Professorial conferment. As detailed in the\\nUniversity’s Code of Practice for REF2021, a formal process for staff to declare personal\\ncircumstances that have adversely affected their ability to research productively over the REF\\ncycle has been implemented. Seventy staff declared circumstances and the University has had\\noutput reduction requests accepted for three UOAs.\\nPGR Culture: Since 2014, 686 students have completed a PhD at LJMU. LJMU has expanded\\nits Level 8 offer to include Dual (n=16, e.g. Bielefeld) and Split Site (n=12, e.g. Transart New\\nYork) awards, PhD by Distance, refreshed its PhD by Published Works for staff (n=14 since\\n2014), included a published paper format route option for PGR and a broad portfolio of\\nProfessional Doctorate Programmes (143 enrolled in 2019/20). The DA (2017) oversees\\ngovernance as well as PGR and supervisor development. The DA launched eDoc (2019) an on-\\nline PGR management software interface and provides a highly current, agile and popular\\nResearcher Development Programme (RDP). RDP content is co-created with the PGR\\ncommunity, an approach that was commended by the QAA (2016; Good Practice case study\\n“Enhancing the postgraduate student partnership”). In 2019/20 95 RDP events had 1,210\\nattendees, which represents a 40% increase in attendance since 2016/17. PGRs use eDoc to\\ncreate their RDP training plans at the start of their doctorate that are synchronised with the PGR\\nlifecycle (“Getting Started” to “Viva Survivor”). Since 2017 (114 PGRs) the DA has run “Thesis\\nBoot Camps”, two-day intensive residential writing programmes for late-stage researchers with\\nexceptionally positive feedback. The impact of the DA, RDP, and the vibrancy of the PGR\\nculture was supported by the Postgraduate Research Student Survey (2019) with high\\nsatisfaction in research skills support (highest quartile) and professional development (5th out of\\n103 UK HEIs).\\nThe DA manages PGR funding for external conference presentation (221 awards between 2014-\\n2020, £60K), training bursaries (14 PGRs have attended a British Library Doctoral Study Day\\nsince 2016), an International Mobility Fund (2017/18; 22 PGRs to visit laboratories, artists,\\n                                                                                               Page 8\\n\\n\\nattend training courses), “Brilliant Club” training (20 PGRs have delivered academic enrichment\\nto 500 local key stage 3-5 pupils) as well as a bespoke training programme (3I’s: Information,\\nIdeas and Insight) to support outreach and teaching. A co-created annual conference attracts\\nc.130 delegates (50 posters/infoposters, 15 3-minute thesis finalists).\\nThe DA promotes a community of practice for supervisors. The Dean of the DA is an Executive\\nSecretary to the UK Council for Graduate Education (UKCGE). After participating in the pilot\\nUKCGE supervisor recognition scheme, LJMU established annual University and faculty\\nsupervisor awards (2018). LJMU launched a “Developing Research Supervision” module, as\\npart of an MA in Academic Practice (2018/19; 22 completions in 2018/19) and is now the route\\nto gain supervisor accreditation at LJMU. A broader Supervisor Development Programme (2018)\\nhad 183 attendees in 2018/19.\\nBetween 2017 and 2020, the DA was a partner in an international RDP (Erasmus Plus KA2\\nStrategic Partnerships: TRANSPEER: A Transnational Project to Enhance Researcher\\nEmployability) led by Karlstad University. A transnational skills training programme was\\ndeveloped and delivered for 36 researchers (10 LJMU) including PGR, supervisors, and DA\\nstaff. LJMU delivered a three-day training event for the full cohort on “personal and professional\\nimpact” website.\\n4. Income, infrastructure, and facilities\\nOrganisation: Operational governance of RKE is led by the University Research and\\nKnowledge Exchange committee (URKEC). URKEC, chaired by the PVC-RKE, includes the\\nDean of the DA, Faculty Associate Deans for RKE, RIS staff (Research Excellence Manager,\\nGrants and Projects Manager, KE Manager, Ethics and Governance Manager), Research\\nConcordat Lead and other relevant staff as required. URKEC reports to the Executive\\nLeadership Team (ELT), Academic Board and communicates to faculty committees.\\nGovernance focus includes research strategy development and monitoring, REF/KEF\\nsubmissions, Concordat oversight as well as resource management, dispersal and monitoring.\\nProfessional services teams (central and faculties) support RKE. RIS (22.9FTE) includes 4\\nteams. Grants and Projects (7.6FTE) and KE teams (10FTE) liaise with academic staff, finance\\nand legal services to provide end-to-end project support as well as undertaking statutory and\\nregulatory reporting requirements. Research Excellence (3FTE) collaborate with all REF UoAs\\n(16), impact case study leads (56), finance, IT and library staff. Ethics and Governance (1.5FTE)\\nrun the institutional Ethics Committee (35 staff) and provide oversight for 14 School/Faculty\\nCommittees. The DA (6FTE) oversees PGR enrolment, progression and completion, runs the\\nUniversity Research Degrees Committee and RDP (10FTE, 10PGR) and links to Faculty\\ncommittees. URKEC collaborates with IT through strategic initiatives and resource investment.\\nIT implemented a move to online platforms (e.g. Grants and Projects Portal [GaP], 626 staff are\\ntrained and active; a PGR management programme [eDoc], 727 PGR and 664 staff are trained\\nand active; Impact Tracker portal to capture the total impact journey; Symplectic Elements, the\\nLJMU research information management system; Library-managed institutional repositories).\\n                                                                                             Page 9\\n\\n\\nInvestment in internal and external academic activity has focussed on strategically important\\nareas. LJMU re-launched (2016) the Institute for Health Research (IHR), a pan-University group\\nwhose focus has been to support interdisciplinary RKE connections internally and with external\\nstakeholders (Liverpool Health Partners, Academic Research Network Northwest Coast, NIHR\\nstudentships). LJMU was a launch partner (2018) to the Liverpool Centre for Cardiovascular\\nScience and Liverpool Centre for Alcohol Research, that brings together clinicians and scientists\\nfrom across Liverpool to provide cardiovascular health and alcohol-related health solutions for\\nthe local population. We engage with small-medium enterprises to develop and grow through\\ncollaborative research and innovation (e.g. KTPs). We co-invest in several European Structural\\nand Investment Fund projects; working in partnership with local Universities and the Local\\nEnterprise Partnership to provide targeted support to our growth sectors. Oversight of local RKE\\ninvestment rests with the Strategic and Regional Projects and Programmes Panel (STAR) that\\nreports to ELT. STAR has co-ordinated our engagement and contribution to key initiatives such\\nas the Knowledge Quarter.\\nResources: Over the REF cycle LJMU has committed £17.1m in strategic support of RKE\\nactivity (facilities, IT) and £321m for infrastructure and capital investment (buildings,\\nrefurbishments). Further, LJMU strategically devolves funding to support RKE across all faculties\\nas well as providing focused central investment in a range of programmes. LJMU’s combined\\nQR income totalled £35.2m and this is dispersed to faculties to cover staffing appointments\\n(INSPIRE posts) and a range of local strategic initiatives (e.g. capital spend, PGR studentships,\\nconsumables [e.g. “Technology Directorate Vouchers” £51K to provide access to unique\\nUniversity of Liverpool laboratories], ECR fellowships, staff development). Outcomes from this\\nresource model are reported in unit-level statements (REF5b). URKEC and faculties have\\nchosen to pump-prime strategic initiatives such as NIHR-linked PhD studentships and cross-\\nfaculty PhD studentships (Drone Technology and Applications). Since 2018, drone-related work\\nhas attracted £1.5m of competitively awarded external income (STFC, Leverhulme, UKRI\\nGCRF). LJMU operates an “incentivization” process by apportioning 50% of the surplus/profit\\nfrom externally funded RKE projects back to the faculties and staff. This allows local strategic\\nresource investment (staff development, PGR recruitment).\\nLJMU directly resources schemes to increase PGR numbers. Since 2014 we have an annual VC\\nPhD studentship competition with 138 full scholarships awarded to exceptional students (£6.5m).\\nLJMU runs a “Match-funded” (50:50 resource split with external stakeholders) PGR studentship\\nscheme (2014) with 45 awards resulting in external income (£1.3m), matched by LJMU. High\\nprofile partners have included Astrazeneca, the British Museum and Premier League football\\nclubs. URKEC also supports bespoke match-funding requests as part of external grant\\napplications (Research England: International Investment Initiative).\\nURKEC coordinates oversight, dispersal, delivery and evaluation for a range of other resources\\nincluding LJMU’s QR-Global Challenges Research Fund allocation (GCRF; £702k, 2017/20) with\\n64 projects in 28 official development assistance countries. These projects address important\\nglobal health, social and economic issues. LJMU has utilised its Strategic Priorities Fund\\nallocation (£126k, 2019/20) to accelerate interactions between researchers and external\\nstakeholders in areas of important translation into policy (n=18). These were strategically\\n                                                                                             Page 10\\n\\n\\naligned with REF impact case study development. One exemplar case study highlighted how the\\nfunding was used to lobby Philippine government officials, charities, and non-governmental\\norganisations regarding the plight of the islanders affected by raised tides following the Bohol\\nearthquake in 2013. LJMU has received Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF) support\\nacross the REF cycle (£9.48m, including additional HEIF uplift grant 2017/18) and has\\ndistributed this to realise our RKE agenda (internal proof of concept funding schemes; patent/IP\\nprotection costs; dedicated RKE professional service team roles and activities). University-wide\\nexternal grant capture is also managed by URKEC, including the MRC “Proximity to Discovery”\\nfunding (2017; £75k) for industry engagement projects between academics and life sciences\\nbusiness (e.g. proof-of-concept that New Zealand blackcurrant extract can improve glucose\\nregulation and insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese individuals).\\nInfrastructure: Core facilities at LJMU include the “Life Sciences Building”, housed in the\\nFaculty of Science (refurbished 2013/14, £8.5m). This comprises state-of-the-art laboratories for:\\nmolecular biology, genetic laboratories, imaging, chemistry, tissue and stem cell culture,\\nhormone analysis, histology suite and an animal house. Four Research Support Officers are\\nemployed, with space supporting 150 researchers across 4 REF UOA (3, 4, 7, 24). The co-\\nlocation of animal and human-based laboratories promotes interdisciplinary and mechanistic\\ninterrogation in areas ranging from sport and exercise science to conservation and biodiversity.\\nIn the Faculty of Health a new (2020; £13.7m) “Simulation Building” houses state-of-the-art\\nfacilities for research related to technical skill development but will also explore the ways in\\nwhich health professionals make their decisions in three UoA (3, 4, 24). In the Faculty of Health,\\nLJMU launched the Centre for Collaborative Innovation in Dementia as a European-accredited\\nliving-lab (2013), working directly with local citizens, SMEs, multinational companies, academics\\nas well as commissioners and providers of services to co-create health related innovations and\\nsolutions. Since 2017 the Centre has attracted £1.09m funding and supported SMEs to co-\\ncreate over twenty innovations and solutions. It has worked with the LCR health ecosystem to\\ninfluence the content of the Local Industrial Strategy and to identify and disseminate good\\npractice at a European level.\\nOpened in 2017, Sensor City, a £13m joint venture with the University of Liverpool, is one of four\\npilot BEIS University Enterprise Zones. Sensor City is a hub for researchers, SMEs, and the\\nwider Sensor and IoT community; enabling industry and academic partners to translate novel\\nand innovative sensor concepts into commercially viable solutions. Between July 2017 and\\nDecember 2019 Sensor City delivered: occupancy for 24.4FTE researchers, 25\\nindustry/academic collaborations and 43 business tenants. Independent evaluation of Sensor\\nCity (Technopolis 2018) concluded that customers value the academic connections provided,\\nthe community of sensor-interested stakeholders and access to state-of the-art prototyping\\nfacilities.\\nLJMU holds over 50 unique and distinctive primary RKE sources in its “Archives and Special\\nCollections”. Curated by Library Services, who also provide training, the collections range from\\nnineteenth century fashion plates through to punk fanzines. The collections are there to inspire\\nnew academic work.

      "['Manchester Metropolitan University\\n 1. Context and mission\\n Manchester Metropolitan is a large, post-1992 institution with 38,000 students including 1,000\\n Post-graduate Research students (PGRs), 1,600 academic and 2,000 professional services\\n staff. Half of our students are the first in their families to study at university and the majority\\n come from the Northwest so we play an important role in widening participation, social mobility\\n and the local economy. Our mission is to make higher education accessible to all those with the\\n passion and ability to benefit from it, and to discover and disseminate knowledge that improves\\n people’s lives.\\n Manchester Metropolitan has seen tremendously exciting and unprecedented growth in its\\n research activities and we are proud to report that we are a radically different institution to the\\n one described in our REF 2014 submission. Specifically, the number of staff returned has more\\n than doubled, the number of outputs has risen, metric-based measures of quality have improved\\n significantly, doctoral conferments have risen and the value of external awards has almost\\n tripled.\\n This progress comes from the appointment of a new senior leadership team with significant\\n experience in the Russell Group and adoption of a new and ambitious Research and Knowledge\\n Exchange (RKE) strategy that focusses on high-quality and impactful research conducted\\n through a network of 14 University Centres for Research and Knowledge Exchange (UCRKE),\\n shown in Figure 1:\\n           Figure 1: University Centres for Research and Knowledge Exchange\\n Although the University is not a member of a mission group, we are a highly collaborative\\n institution and make a strong contribution to the global research ecosystem - with 78 members\\n                                                                                                     Page 1\\n\\n\\n of peer review colleges/funding panels (including all UK research councils) and six REF panel\\n members.\\n A high proportion (46%) of our outputs are co-authored with international partners and 43% of\\n income comes from work with business and industry; we are consistently in the top five for\\n Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs) and helped to draft the Knowledge Exchange\\n Concordat.\\n We engage in collaborative research with the other Greater Manchester HEIs and are active in\\n research-focused organizations, such as Health Innovation Manchester and Manchester\\n Science Partnership (a major provider of science incubation facilities). We are members of the\\n AHRC-funded Northwest Consortium Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP), the ESRC-funded\\n White Rose DTP and a Marie-Sklodowska-Curie Doctoral Training Academy in Biosciences. We\\n helped to draft the Science and Innovation Audit for Greater Manchester and East Cheshire,\\n Greater Manchester’s Industrial Strategy\\n The University is led by Vice Chancellor, Malcolm Press, supported by Deputy Vice Chancellor\\n and Provost, Stephen Decent and Chief Operating Officer, Karen Moore. There are three\\n thematic Pro-Vice-Chancellors (RKE, Education and International). We have five faculties (Arts\\n and Humanities, Business and Law, Education, Health, Psychology and Social Care, and\\n Science and Engineering) and a professional services division, which includes a newly-\\n expanded ‘full-service’ RKE Directorate led by Justine Daniels.\\n Leadership for the RKE Strategy and UCRKE performance is provided by the PVC RKE,\\n Richard Greene, who chairs the RKE, Research Ethics and Governance, and Research Degrees\\n Committees. These committees report to the University’s Board of Governors via the University\\n Executive Group and Academic Board.\\n 2. Research and Knowledge Exchange Strategy\\n The RKE Strategy was approved in early 2017 and describes our desire to have a beneficial\\n impact on society, culture, the environment and the economy. It presents research and\\n knowledge exchange as a continuum and emphasizes the links between excellent research and\\n excellent teaching. It created the UCRKEs and a new RKE Directorate to support their activities.\\n University Centres for Research and Knowledge Exchange (UCRKE)\\n UCRKEs provide an intellectual home for academic colleagues as well as research staff and all\\n PGR students. They are the primary vehicle through which we have increased the quality,\\n volume and impact of our research.\\n Achievement of strategic goals\\n Inspiring leadership, excellent support and investment into UCRKEs have transformed our\\n research environment, culture and performance, specificly:-\\n \\uf0b7 The number of staff in our REF return has grown by 117% from 339 in 2014 to 736 in 2021.\\n \\uf0b7 Outputs published annually have increased by 100% from 684 in 2014 to 1372 in 2020.\\n \\uf0b7 Field-weighted citation impact of outputs has increased from 1.15 in 2014 to 1.54 in 2020\\n     (source: Scopus).\\n \\uf0b7 Outputs amongst the top 10% cited in the world (field-weighted) have increased from 94 in\\n     2014 to 217 in 2020 (source: Scopus).\\n \\uf0b7 Outputs in the top 10% of journals (field-weighed and source-normalised) have increased\\n     from 91 in 2014 to 341 in 2020 (source: Scopus).\\n \\uf0b7 Research income has doubled from £25m in REF 2014 to £53m in REF 2021.\\n \\uf0b7 Annual research income has increased by 140% from £4m in 2013/14 to £9.7m in 2019/20.\\n \\uf0b7 Annual research awards have increased by 134% from £6.4m in 2013/14 to £15m in\\n     2019/20.\\n \\uf0b7 We are consistently ranked in the top five for KTPs.

They support the delivery of award-winning public engagement\\n and have access to the Impact Generator Fund (up to £10,000) and Just-in-time (JIT) funding of\\n £1,000 for smaller activities.\\n We have one of the best KTP support teams in the UK. We have secured 69 KTPs worth over\\n £8.45m since 2013. Our KTP with the Greater Manchester Youth Justice Partnership won a\\n Times Higher Award for Knowledge Exchange initiative of the year. In 2020, we were KTP of\\n the Year in the annual awards.\\n Our experience as a founding partner in the Beacons for Public Engagement initiative continues\\n to underpin the ethos of our engagement activities. We are a signatory to the NCCPE Manifesto\\n for Public Engagement. Our commitment to the Concordat for Engaging the Public and the UK\\n Research and Innovation (UKRI) 2019 ‘Vision for Public Engagement’ was praised in a recent\\n UKRI audit. We are also members of the UN’s Academic Impact Network.\\n In 2019, we received the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for the impact of poetry. We were\\n shortlisted for Times Higher awards for the impact of history projects in 2014 and 2020, and in\\n 2018 for a project on the engagement of young people struggling with ‘internal voices’.\\n Microbiologist Joanna Verran won the American Association for the Advancement of Science\\n award for Public Engagement in 2019.\\n Internal funding is available for partnerships with communities. Examples of success include an\\n AHRC EDI Fellowship (2020), UKRI award for Place Based Partnerships in Public Engagement\\n (2019), AHRC skills funding for Creating Our Future Histories, and hub status for the ESRC\\n Festival of Social Science. £50,000 per annum is invested into RAH! a flagship public\\n engagement initiative in arts and humanities disciplines running since 2015.\\n Training for staff and PGRs is focused around Vitae’s ‘Engaging Researcher’ course. We\\n participate in BSA’s Media Fellowship scheme offering placements worth £5,000. Staff who\\n deliver training are members of NCCPE’s Public Engagement Academy and PEP network.\\n In 2017, we established MetroPolis, a research-led think tank to amplify policy-related impact.\\n Besides training and resources, MetroPolis offers Policy Fellowships created with our Chancellor\\n Lord Mandelson. The Chancellor’s Fellowships provide resources for academics to spend time\\n in partner organisations so that research is translated into policy impact. Fellowships have taken\\n place with the UN, the UK Government, Greater Manchester Combined Authority, the Northern\\n Powerhouse Partnership and NHS Trusts. We are members of the Universities Policy\\n Engagement Network.\\n Research Integrity\\n We take research integrity and ethics extremely seriously. The Research Ethics and\\n Governance Committee, chaired by the PVC RKE, reports to the Academic Board. Membership\\n comprises Faculty Heads of Research Ethics and Governance, the Designated Individual for the\\n Human Tissue Authority and representatives from professional services.\\n Heads of Research Ethics and Governance have clear responsibilities, time allowance and\\n administrative support. They chair faculty ethics committees, conduct ethical reviews and\\n undertake annual audits. The PVC RKE also chairs the Health and Safety Committee, which\\n ensures that the needs of potentially dangerous areas of research are considered appropriately.\\n                                                                                              Page 3\\n\\n\\n We have invested circa £1m in staff, systems and training to ensure that all researchers,\\n including PGRs and undergraduates, are aware of their professional and legal responsibilities.\\n Our online system, EthOS, has enabled the review and approval of 14,243 applications.\\n We comply with the Concordat for Research Integrity by providing a publically-accessible annual\\n statement, clear contact points and information on processes for investigating allegations of\\n research misconduct.\\n Open access\\n Our Open Access policy complies with REF requirements and enables researchers to follow the\\n Green or Gold routes. Our institutional repository ‘e-space’ includes 15,989 items with more than\\n two million downloads.\\n We spend around £120,000 per year on APCs and have discounted APCs with publishers,\\n including the Royal Society of Chemistry and IEEE. We are a member of the Open Library of\\n Humanities Library Partnership subsidy scheme.\\n The University is active in national open access agendae. DVC Stephen Decent is chair of the\\n Universities UK strategy group negotiating agreements with major academic publishers.\\n Staff regularly share their research through social media, blogs and twitter accounts. Since\\n 2014, 168 staff have written 329 articles for The Conversation read by over ten million people.\\n Open research data\\n The University’s Research Data Management policy complies with the Concordat on Open\\n Research Data. It aligns with expectations of funders and provides clarity on the responsibilities\\n of researchers. We have invested £500,000 into high quality data storage facilities and staff\\n deposit their datasets into e-space with support from an RKE Digital Archivist and librarians.\\n We are committed to the responsible use of metrics and have signed up to DORA. Our\\n colleagues have served on the influential LIS-Bibliometrics committee and we have hosted\\n national events related to responsible metrics.\\n Interdisciplinary research\\n To promote interdisciplinary research our UCRKEs have porous boundaries and we bring their\\n memberships together in a monthly forum. We have also established interdisciplinary networks\\n in Ageing and Dementia, Place, Substance Use, Childhood and Youth, Artificial Intelligence,\\n Critical Medical Humanities and Biosocial Digital Education.\\n 3. People\\n 3.1 Staffing Strategy\\n We have more than doubled the number of staff in REF 2021 compared with REF 2014. Our\\n staffing strategy has driven this change and has the following elements:\\n  \\uf0b7 Alignment of workload and resources to UCRKEs to make our environment intellectually\\n      and financially sustainable, and ultimately more attractive to research focused colleagues.\\n  \\uf0b7 Prioritization of research capability in new appointments.\\n  \\uf0b7 Streamlining processes for recruiting research leaders.\\n  \\uf0b7 Supporting staff at all stages of their research careers and incentivising high performance.\\n  \\uf0b7 A flexible working environment with an emphasis on equality, diversity and inclusion.\\n We are a signatory to the Concordat for Career Development of Researchers and have held the\\n EU HR Excellence in Research award for 8 years.\\n New appointments\\n We have appointed 335.8 FTE new staff with a significant responsibility for research since 2014\\n – including 98.8 FTE new professors (with a growing number from research ‘intensives’ including\\n                                                                                              Page 4\\n\\n\\n Manchester, Sheffield, Lancaster, Glasgow and Birmingham) appointed through the new\\n streamlined process.\\n The combination of new appointments and the development of existing staff has resulted in a\\n balanced contract profile throughout our submission:\\n   Professor                  Principal Lecturer      Senior Lecturer          Lecturer, Research\\n                              and Reader                                       Fellow\\n   19%                        16%                     46%                      19%\\n Staff contract level profile (Table 1)\\n Early Career Researchers account for 15% of submitted staff, indicating a sustainable pipeline of\\n talent and 3% are on fixed-term contracts.\\n Research workload arrangements\\n Full research members of UCRKEs are allocated a minimum of 20% of their workload for\\n research time (reviewed annually). Staff who are developing their own independent research\\n careers are categorised as ‘associate members’ (see Code of Practice) and their allocation is\\n based on personal development plans.\\n The University has recently reorganised teaching into timetabled blocks, which brings\\n pedagogical benefits and helps researchers who need periods of uninterrupted research time;\\n this is particularly helpful in some disciplines.\\n Reward and progression\\n We have introduced two Academic Career Pathways – Education, Pedagogy and Citizenship,\\n and Research, Education and Citizenship.\\n We have open and inclusive annual promotion rounds in which information sessions are\\n provided by PVCs’ RKE and Education, as well as FHRKE, to ensure that colleagues are\\n informed of the criteria. Additional information workshops are organised for BAME and /or\\n female colleagues. Equality and diversity considerations are included in the promotions process\\n through the confidential declaration of individual circumstances.\\n Colleagues can also apply for increments to reward excellent research and impact activities and\\n professors have an annual pay review.\\n Flexible working\\n Our policies facilitate part-time working, compressed hours, job-sharing, homeworking, career\\n breaks and remote working. Timetabling arrangements support colleagues with caring\\n responsibilities, while meetings and the majority of research seminars take place during normal\\n working hours.\\n UCRKE membership is reviewed annually with a confidential process for the disclosure of\\n equality-related issues, leading to the adjustment of expectations. ECRs have reduced\\n expectations of research outputs and we make similar adjustments for staff with caring\\n responsibilities, those with chronic disabilities and those returning to work after sickness or\\n family-related absence. All staff have access to the Lifeworks portal for counselling, confidential\\n advice and support for personal issues.\\n Part-time and fixed-term staff have the same access to PDRs, internal funding and professional\\n development opportunities as full-time staff.\\n Staff development and support for ECRs\\n The RKE Strategy states that, “we want the University to be the best place to start and develop a\\n research career” and, in line with our commitment to the Concordat for Career Development of\\n Researchers, “provide a suite of development opportunities for staff at all career stages”.\\n                                                                                                 Page 5\\n\\n\\n Institutional schemes include RKE Future Leaders that aligns to the Vitae Researcher\\n Development Framework (RDF) (50 graduates since 2014) and Good to Great, which supports\\n more experienced colleagues, with interventions such as coaching, sabbaticals, exchanges,\\n equipment and training. So far, 20 colleagues have entered the scheme and several have been\\n promoted to reader and professor.\\n In faculties, there are schemes such as Developing Research Excellence (DRE) in our Business\\n School, which has helped colleagues ‘graduate’ to full UCRKE membership and has supported\\n 75 ECRs since 2014. All UCRKE provide seed funding and research mentoring for ECRs.\\n Our sabbatical programme has helped increase the volume and quality of monographs in\\n Humanities and Social Sciences. Currently over 100 staff are supported to study for a PhD.\\n 3.2 Research Students\\n We have expanded our Graduate School and embedded it within the RKE Directorate; it has\\n three main objectives:\\n 1. To develop creative, professional, open, independent leaders with strong ethical values.\\n 2. To prepare PGR students to contribute to society, culture, the environment and the economy.\\n 3. To attract a diverse range of high-quality PGR students.\\n Recruitment of doctoral students\\n In this submission, we report a large increase in doctoral conferments (with 683 compared to\\n 392 in REF 2014). On the census date, we had 1,069 active PGR students and have averaged\\n 816 PGR students per year since 2013/14. 82% of PGRs are from Home/EU (68% from the UK)\\n and 18% are from overseas. 47% of PGRs are part-time. We recruit PGRs from 83 different\\n countries. We are in the top quartile of UK universities for the quality of our PGR experience for\\n overseas students (PRES 2019).\\n PGR equality\\n Female students account for 52% of PGRs and 13% of PGRs have a disability (compared with a\\n national average of 10%). We have strong processes for making reasonable adjustments, as\\n evidenced by the achievement of national standards (see Equality and Diversity), and our\\n ranking in the top quartile for the quality of PGR experience according to students with a\\n disability (Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES) 2019).\\n Ethnicity of PGRs\\n  White                  70%\\n  Black                  5%\\n  Chinese                2%\\n  Asian                  9%\\n  Mixed / Other          12%\\n  Unknown                2%\\n We are particularly successful at attracting Black and Asian students from the lowest quintile\\n participation group, with 25% of female and 42% of male Black PGRs, and 14% of female and\\n 23% of male Asian PGRs from quintile 1, compared to 8% of female and 10% of male White\\n PGRs.\\n We are in the top quartile for the quality of PGR experience for BAME students (PRES 2019).\\n Age of PGRs\\n  Under 30                13%\\n  30 – 40                 35%\\n  40 – 50                 26%\\n  50+                     26%\\n                                                                                              Page 6\\n\\n\\n Our youngest PGR student is 24 and our oldest is 85 years old.\\n Studentships from major funders\\n The University is a member of two UKRI Doctoral Training Partnerships - the AHRC Northwest\\n Doctoral Consortium and the ESRC White Rose DTA.\\n   DTA                         2017/18       2018/19       2019/20        2020/21\\n   White Rose ESRC             3             5             7\\n   Northwest AHRC                            7             6\\n The University has also received six funded International PhD Fellowships through the\\n DTA3/COFUND Marie Sklodowska-Curie scheme as part of the University Alliance DTA in\\n Applied Biosciences for Health, Energy and Social Policy, which has contributed more than\\n €400,000 in income.\\n Monitoring and support mechanisms\\n PRES 2019 showed that our overall satisfaction has increased to 83%. The quality of\\n supervision, progression and research skills are in the top overall quartile nationally. Supervision\\n quality is higher than all our benchmarking groups, and research skills is above the Russell\\n Group benchmark.\\n All PGRs and supervisors use SkillsForge to automate reminders about official milestones and\\n track training, discussions and actions agreed in formal reviews. Milestones ensure that\\n progression requirements are understood and provide formal opportunities to address concerns.\\n Detailed progress reviews are undertaken by independent panels.\\n Principal Supervisors complete mandatory training and there are compulsory workshops for all\\n supervisors. The University Teaching Academy provides a 15-credit module for staff who are\\n new to supervising.\\n PGR Skills and Career Development\\n The Graduate School provides training for PGRs mapped onto the Vitae RDF. Activities include\\n workshops, events such as Three Minute Thesis and Images of Research, online training and\\n support for teaching. PGRs can attend events run by the North-West universities network and\\n DTPs in the region, and can access opportunities through the Brilliant Club.\\n All PGRs join a UCRKE, which provides access to high-level research skills, training,\\n mentorship, ECR conferences and events, access to equipment, support for careers, funding to\\n attend conferences and opportunities to celebrate achievements. Financial support for\\n conferences, field work and language learning, is also available from The Graduate School.\\n PGRs can access careers and employability resources including My Career Hub, which provides\\n over 5,000 resources including interactive assessments and tests, an interview simulator, online\\n courses, industry reports and careers advice.\\n Study leave\\n There is a policy on Maternity, Paternity and Adoption leave for funded PGR students. Internally-\\n funded students are entitled to funding in line with UKRI students of up to 52 weeks of maternity,\\n adoption or shared parental leave, with the first 26 weeks of each pregnancy paid at full stipend\\n rate, and 13 weeks paid at a level commensurate with employee entitlements to statutory\\n maternity.

This is because\\n of greater emphasis on equality in recruitment and promotion, flexible working policies,\\n processes for the declaration of individual circumstances as part of UCRKE membership and\\n researcher support mechanisms that have a strong uptake from female staff (RKE Future\\n Leaders and Good to Great).\\n We were awarded Institutional Athena SWAN Bronze in 2018. For 2019, our gender pay gap\\n was almost 10% more equitable than the rest of the sector: 6.3% (mean) and 5.7% (median)\\n against 15.1% (mean) and 14.8% (median).\\n Disability\\n We are returning a higher percentage of disabled staff than the sector average. In 2017, we\\n became the first university to achieve ‘Gold’ status in Business Disability Forum’s (BDF)\\n Disability Standard, one of only five organisations nationally. We have been a member of BDF\\n since 2000 and they describe us as a ‘sector-leading disability-smart organisation’. In 2019, we\\n were awarded the highest level of the Government’s voluntary Disability Confident Scheme.\\n Ethnicity\\n Our Professoriate is diverse. 13% of our professors identify as BAME compared with 10%\\n across the sector and 7% of our female professors identify as BAME compared with 2%\\n nationally. We currently employ nine out of only 440 female professors who identify as BAME\\n nationally and three female professors out of 25 nationally who identify as black (9% of the total\\n population).\\n The University became a Race Equality Charter member in 2019.\\n Sexuality\\n We have participated in the Stonewall WEI continuously since 2016. In 2019, we were second in\\n the English education sector on Stonewall’s Workplace Equality Index (WEI) and 22nd in the\\n                                                                                              Page 8\\n\\n\\n WEI national Top 100. In 2020, the University was accredited as the UK’s first Manchester Pride\\n Role Model Organisation. In 2019, we were recognised as one of only 14 Stonewall Top Trans\\n inclusive employers.\\n Application of our REF 2021 Code of Practice (CoP)\\n Our CoP was developed following extensive and very constructive discussions at open events;\\n staff committees and in meetings with the University and College Union (UCU). It received\\n enthusiastic approval from the University’s Executive; the Academic Board and our Diversity and\\n Equal Opportunities Committee. As an important part of our commitment to Equality and\\n Diversity, those involved in REF decisions were required to complete equality and diversity\\n training.\\n All colleagues have had an opportunity to declare individual circumstances and 68 have decided\\n to do so, leading to output expectations being adjusted where appropriate. We considered\\n EDAP’s advice before concluding that the effects of individual circumstances could be managed\\n without the need for any UoA output reductions.\\n After using our CoP to determine which colleagues had SRR, we ran an independent appeals\\n process in which four staff appealed and two cases were upheld.\\n Output selections were based on the processes set out in our CoP. We will report on the equality\\n impacts of output selections in our REF 2021 EIA but evidence suggests that the outputs were\\n selected fairly.\\n 4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n 4.1 Institutional strategy for research income\\n Our strategy is to invest in high-quality and impactful research across UCRKEs and to provide\\n the best possible professional services support. We encourage strong relationships with funders\\n and have 78 staff on peer review colleges and panels including representation on all UKRI\\n research councils.\\n UCRKEs are supported in income generation activities by significant investment and\\n professional services support in the form of dedicated Research Development Managers.\\n UCRKEs receive substantial investment (from QR) in the form of an annual operating budget\\n (£20,000) and have access to the Strategic Opportunities Fund (SOF), which has invested\\n £11.5m into new posts, infrastructure and PGR studentships since 2016.\\n A further £200,000 per annum is invested into Research Accelerator Grants to help ECRs\\n generate preliminary data for external funding applications. Since 2014, we have funded 63 such\\n projects leading to awards from NIHR, AHRC and Leverhulme. We also fund exchange visits\\n such as Research Fellowships and International Collaboration Funding awards. There are funds\\n for impact and public engagement, business engagement and match-funding of up to £40,000\\n for partnerships aligned with strategic agenda, such as the Industrial Strategy.\\n Global Challenges Research Funding supports partnership development aligned to the UN\\n Sustainable Development Goals. Since 2017, £700k has been invested in projects in the\\n Ngorongoro Crater Conservation Area Authority in Tanzania and research into the discrimination\\n and social isolation of Dalit Law students in India.\\n Annual HEIF funding of £1.2m supports the integration of research, innovation and knowledge\\n exchange\\n The importance of income generation is incentivized through research workload allocations, an\\n annual promotions scheme, and celebration and networking events with senior colleagues.\\n Awards and Income\\n                                                                                             Page 9\\n\\n\\n Since 2014, we have generated 1,401 RKE awards with a combined value of £105m (with\\n notable awards from AHRC, ESRC, EPSRC, NIHR, MRC and NERC).\\n The value of research awards has risen significantly to a total £68.3m with reportable research\\n income of £53.284m (compared to £25.785m in REF 2014).

      "['Nottingham Trent University (NTU)\\n 1. Context and mission\\n Nottingham Trent University (NTU) is experiencing ‘a period of unprecedented success’ (Good\\n University Guide, 2018), recognised by three University of the Year awards since 2017. This\\n derives from rigorous implementation of its institutional strategy - ‘Creating the University of the\\n Future’ - articulated under five strategic themes in 2015. One strategic theme was Valuing Ideas,\\n focused on research, innovation and impact.\\n NTU’s research has attracted specific accolades, including the Queen’s Anniversary Prize,\\n 2015, for research into safety and security. Nottingham Business School (NBS) gained EQUIS\\n accreditation following forensic examination of its research credentials. Research teams in the\\n School of Social Sciences (SoSS) won the Office of National Statistics Research Excellence\\n Award, 2019. Professor Carole Perry from the School of Science and Technology (SST)\\n received a Royal Society Wolfson Merit Award. Professor Paul Evans, also from SST, was\\n appointed a Royal Society Wolfson Fellow, given the Institute of Physics Dennis Gabor Medal\\n and Prize, and the THE Award for Outstanding Contribution to Innovation and Technology.\\n Valuing Ideas foregrounds partnership. This REF period has seen the commencement of\\n research collaborations with the Universities of Birmingham, King’s College London, and\\n Southampton on economic development, student access and participation, and e-textiles,\\n respectively. NTU is a lead organisation in the Doctoral Training Alliance (DTA) of 20 universities\\n across England and a member of both the AHRC Midlands4Cities (M4C) Doctoral Training\\n Partnership (DTPship) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council\\n (BBSRC) Doctoral Training Programme (DTProg). NTU has created a unique civic partnership\\n with the University of Nottingham: Universities for Nottingham.\\n Strong relationships internationally include a growing portfolio of research collaborations and\\n joint doctoral programmes. These include: NBS’s joint appointments with Copenhagen Business\\n School; the School of Architecture Design and the Built Environment’s (ADBE) work with the\\n universities of Mosul and Wasit (and Leeds and Durham) on preserving the cultural heritage of\\n Iraq; and the SoSS Skin Integrity Group’s partnership with the universities of Tokyo and\\n Montpellier. Doctoral programmes include: EU Horizon 2020 International Training Network with\\n 16 European partners; joint award programmes with IIT Bombay in STEM and social sciences;\\n and with Universidade Catolica Portuguesa (Porto) and Universitat Ramon Llull (Barcelona) in\\n Applied Psychology.\\n Outside academia, partnership underpins formal strategic agreements with local public service\\n organisations and major businesses that enable research that drives innovation. This is\\n exemplified by NTU’s professional doctorate offer – with 113 completions in this REF cycle –\\n and by multi award-winning place-based research in the SoSS on reducing reoffending amongst\\n sexual offenders with HMP Whatton and work by NBS to enable Boots, the largest private local\\n employer, to tackle the gender pay gap.\\n NTU is amongst the ten largest universities in the UK. It enrolled over 34,000 students,\\n encompassing almost 800 postgraduate research students, in 2019/20. They are taught by over\\n 2,000 academic staff, up by over 400 since July 2013, representing a cumulative increased\\n investment in academic capacity of around £25m per annum. Furthermore, since 2015 NTU has\\n invested significantly in enhancing academic leadership, reaching £1.4m every year in 2020.\\n Overall, these investments have resulted in 421 academics being returned in REF 2021\\n compared to 267 in REF 2014.\\n Annual income stood at £330 million in 2019/20, of which over £20 million was funding body\\n grants. NTU benefits from philanthropic donations to support research, such as £2.82 million\\n from the van Geest Foundation Cancer Research Fund. It has spent £45m on facilities that\\n support research and enterprise within a £166m capital programme over the REF period.\\n                                                                                                Page 1\\n\\n\\n NTU has nurtured synergies across mature disciplinary research strengths to build five areas of\\n research priority: Health and Wellbeing; Medical Technologies and Advanced Materials; Global\\n Heritage; Sustainable Futures; and Safety and Security of Citizens and Society. These priorities\\n reflect the mission in Valuing Ideas to ‘change the world’ and to ‘working across boundaries’.\\n They align to UN Sustainable Development Goals, connect to UK grand challenges in research\\n and innovation in the Industrial Strategy, and map to the Midlands Engine regional goals. Each\\n priority area is led by a multi-disciplinary team sustained by resources totalling £1.8m across the\\n REF cycle.\\n Investment in research leadership is exemplified by appointment of eight Associate Deans for\\n Research (ADRs, one per School), who have strengthened NTU’s network of research centres\\n to realise its commitment to ‘intellectual depth’. The NTU Doctoral School has been re-energised\\n to enhance the experience of doctoral candidates, achieving above sector-average overall\\n satisfaction score of 82% in PRES 2019. Twenty-two posts have been created in newly-\\n centralised research development and support teams - an annual investment of £1.13m - to\\n complement specialist input to researchers from finance and legal services.\\n Achieving impact through innovation is central to Valuing Ideas. Nottingham has a large\\n concentration of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs). Consequently, the University has\\n invested £8m in a new Enterprise and Innovation Centre co-funded by Ministry for Housing,\\n Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) and the D2N2 Local Enterprise Partnership\\n (LEP).\\n Over the REF period, NTU has match funded £10m to European Structural and Investment Fund\\n (ESIF) grants of £13.7m, enabling engagement with over 1800 businesses; this represents one\\n of the largest support programmes to SMES in the UK. The D2N2 LEP put £9.7m towards the\\n £23m cost of the Medical Technology Innovation Facility (MTIF), which has a dual base on\\n NTU’s Clifton Campus and the Boots City site, and £0.8m towards the Smart Wireless\\n Innovation Facility (SWIFt, a collaboration with Digital Catapult).\\n 2. Strategy\\n Valuing Ideas sets out the University’s strategic research vision to: “possess strong relationships\\n and robust processes that enable discovery, drive innovation, and change the world, our\\n students, and ourselves”; and “promote our disciplinary breadth, our intellectual depth, and our\\n commitment to working across boundaries”. The Board of Governors adopted two Key\\n Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor delivery of NTU’s research ambitions: number of\\n registered doctoral students; and research grant and contract income. The following paragraphs\\n describe delivery on the commitments within Valuing Ideas.\\n ‘We will implement a robust strategy to expand our research excellence and further our\\n capability and capacity to be a valued partner in projects of high commercial and public\\n salience’\\n This undertaking drove investment of over £4m every year into front-line research through QR\\n funding and £3.5m of University resources to a PGR Scholarship Fund. Another £1.4m per\\n annum supported the creation of research leadership posts, including the new role of Deputy\\n Vice-Chancellor - Research and Enterprise. ADRs brought senior disciplinary expertise and\\n experience to generating school research plans and enhancing collegiate research\\n environments. These school research plans shape the institutional-level research and innovation\\n policies through the Academic Research Leadership Team (ARLT). Established in 2015, ARLT\\n has championed new research centres, identified NTU’s five priority research areas, and led\\n activity around research ethics, integrity and impact. ADRs are also members of both the\\n University Research Committee and University Leadership Team, putting research at the heart\\n of institutional decision making.\\n                                                                                               Page 2\\n\\n\\n Two further posts support the DVC (R&E), leading new teams on Knowledge Exchange and\\n Enterprise, thus linking academics better with funders, partners and collaborators. As a result,\\n local businesses have been able to deliver 51 new to market products and introduce 324 new to\\n firm products. The University has made 40 new patent applications and created four new spin\\n outs that joined an existing portfolio of five companies, with total estimated external investment\\n of £1,338,000; the most recent was into Halo X Ray Technologies Ltd which secured £500,000.\\n There have been 23 jointly-funded collaborative PhDs since 2017 and 13 KTPs, together worth\\n over £2.5m.\\n Nottingham Civic Exchange is an NTU-funded Think Tank focused on the local impact of its\\n research. By investing £737k since 2015, academics have enhanced the influence of their\\n research on topics such as modern slavery. This regional focus underpins NTU sponsoring the\\n Nottingham Festival of Science and Curiosity, a programme of over sixty free events focused on\\n science, engineering and technology.\\n During the REF period, NTU has created six posts in a Strategic Partnerships team to stimulate\\n relationships with major private and public service enterprises, for example, Nottingham\\n Universities Hospitals Trust (NUHT) and Fujitsu. Formal agreements set out programmes of\\n mutual activity to drive knowledge exchange. This team also facilitates cultural partnerships\\n where NTU has put £1m into its relationships with Nottingham Castle Trust, Nottingham\\n Contemporary, Nottingham Playhouse and Nottingham UNESCO City of Literature.\\n NTU has invested £245k in bespoke public affairs support over the last five years. This has\\n facilitated academic colleagues in optimising the impact of their research on politicians and\\n policy-makers. NTU academics have submitted 38 evidence statements to Parliamentary Select\\n Committees since 2014 and made at least ten appearances.\\n A constructive relationship with the media is central to impact. Three members of the\\n communications team develop stories derived from research. Since 2014, more than 1,150 NTU\\n research news stories have appeared in national and international media, alongside almost\\n 4,000 stories where academics have provided expert comment. They have featured: on BBC\\n Radio 4’s Today Programme, World at One and In Our Time; on BBC TV’s Breakfast, Newsnight\\n and The One Show as well as Sky News; and on the front pages of The Times, Sunday Times\\n and Daily Telegraph.\\n NTU was one of the initial partners of thought-leadership website, The Conversation. This\\n platform has carried some 635 pieces from NTU academics, amassing almost 29 million views.\\n In 2019, NTU was top among UK universities for total readership, attracting 5.5 million views\\n globally and reproduction in prestigious outlets such as The Washington Post and Scientific\\n American.\\n ‘We will develop and nurture the next generation of researchers’\\n The Doctoral School provides comprehensive support, skills training, and community focus for\\n all postgraduate researchers. NTU is proud of the diversity of its doctoral cohort; in 2019/19,\\n 28% of UK-domiciled PGRs identified as BAME, which is considerably above the sector\\n average. Growth has been driven by significant investment in circa 60 new awards per annum\\n for PhD scholarships for both Home/EU and international students, alongside 123 government\\n sponsored PGRs and 33 externally sponsored collaborative programmes including partnerships\\n with the Environment Agency and the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organisation.\\n NTU established the ground-breaking University Alliance DTA in Applied Biosciences for Health\\n and led roll-out of this multi-partner cohort-based national doctoral training partnership to Energy\\n and Social Policy. It delivers a cross-disciplinary training programme to nearly 200 postgraduate\\n researchers, of which NTU has hosted 18. A Marie Skłodowska-Curie PhD Fellowship\\n programme, where NTU hosts eight fellows, has brought international researchers into the\\n partnership.\\n                                                                                                Page 3\\n\\n\\n NTU is a long-standing partner in the AHRC M4C DTPship, where 8 Midlands universities train\\n the next generation of arts and humanities researchers. NTU has secured 62 awards across\\n M4C and its predecessor, M3C. The University is a full partner within the BBSRC DTProg led by\\n the University of Nottingham.\\n Doctoral researchers are encompassed within the remit of NTU’s Success for All Steering\\n Group. Chaired by the Vice-Chancellor, this brings sector-leading data and focused action plans\\n to bear on any characteristics that indicate that our students may not fulfil their academic\\n potential.\\n The Scholarship Projects for Undergraduate Research (SPUR) and associated departmental\\n schemes offer bursaries for NTU undergraduate students to contribute to staff research projects.\\n To date, 436 projects have been awarded bursaries worth more than £500,000 across 77\\n subject areas.\\n ‘Our commitment to working across boundaries …’\\n NTU’s strategic focus on addressing key societal challenges necessitates interdisciplinary\\n approaches, as represented by its five priority research areas outlined above. Within each area,\\n NTU researchers from disparate disciplines collaborate within and beyond the institution. Each\\n priority has senior academic leadership with responsibility for committing up to £120k pa.\\n During 2020, NTU has selected one of these priority areas - Cultural Heritage - as its first\\n Research Peak. The development of these priorities into peaks will serve to highlight both their\\n current excellence and future potential. NTU has allocated an annual budget of £500k to\\n enhance research in this initial peak, in particular to develop further international collaboration.\\n The boundaries NTU crosses are not just disciplinary. The NTU Global team plays a key role,\\n investing £691k in seed-corn funding for individual and institutional international collaborations\\n since 2016. This has led to NTU’s partnership with Panjab University in India which has\\n generated two GIAN and one Commonwealth Rutherford Awards. Through such initiatives,\\n internationally co-authored papers have risen from 29.4% in 2014 to 58.8% in 2020.\\n ‘Robust processes that enable discovery, drive innovation, and change the world …’\\n An effective research strategy has to be underpinned by robust research policies and\\n procedures. NTU is fully compliant with the relevant research-related concordats. These inform\\n the University’s practice around research ethics and integrity, research environment, support\\n and training for researchers, public engagement and knowledge exchange.\\n NTU publishes an annual statement on research integrity, detailing initiatives to embed\\n institutional culture around research integrity. NTU is committed to transparency regarding\\n research misconduct; on rare occasions where such misconduct is substantiated, anonymised\\n details of the misconduct and corrective measures appear in the annual statement. In 2018, a\\n review of research integrity led to the establishment of the University Research Integrity\\n Committee charged with providing institutional oversight.\\n Publication Policy and Research Data Management Policy support researchers by maximising\\n the impact of their research outputs through open access and open data. NTU’s Institutional\\n Repository (IRep) enables the sharing of outputs internally and externally. NTU policies go\\n beyond the REF open access policy, requiring full text deposit of datasets and book chapters, as\\n well journal articles and conference proceedings with an ISSN. Both Open Access and Open\\n Data have been supported through £318k of strategic investment.\\n The next five years\\n                                                                                                  Page 4\\n\\n\\n ‘We have defined, resourced, and promoted a compelling portfolio of world-class research and\\n innovation. We have created new ways for collaborators to share in the spirit of creativity and\\n curiosity that characterises our research, scholarship, and practice.’\\n This statement refreshes the overarching ambition for the Valuing Ideas theme within NTU’s\\n 2020-2025 strategy, University, reimagined. The theme focuses on four topics; for each there is\\n a major new approach that will build on progress since 2014.\\n 1. We will focus our attention on challenges that are as relevant to our stakeholders\\n locally and regionally as they are of global concern, partnering with outstanding institutions that\\n share our aspirations and recognise our contributions.\\n NTU will support its strongest research and research leaders in areas of continuing international\\n salience for policy and practice. These will be supported by investment that will enable proactive\\n recruitment, support established and early career colleagues, and underpin enhanced\\n partnerships with universities around the world.\\n In terms of intellectual focus, in addition to Global Heritage, NTU will build on external funding\\n into the MTIF and Smart Wireless Innovation Facility (SWIFt, a collaboration with Digital\\n Catapult) and progress within its Health and Wellbeing and Medical Technologies and Advanced\\n Materials research priority areas to develop the next generation of health care interventions.\\n Academics in the Safety and Security of Citizens and Society priority area have been leading the\\n Cabinet Office’s C-19 Foresight Group on the response to the pandemic. NTU will expand its\\n research and practice to support frontline responders and local resilience fora in dealing with\\n future emergencies. Colleagues in the Sustainable Futures area will be central to the\\n contribution Universities for Nottingham will make to the achievement of local, regional and\\n national commitments to net zero carbon emissions.\\n 2. We will transform our international reputation through shaping a research narrative based on\\n excellence and impact that generates esteem, stimulates collaboration and establishes\\n opportunities.\\n NTU has some of the UK’s most adept academics in using social media to promote their\\n research and its implications. Learning from this experience and expertise, NTU will create\\n bespoke social media platforms that enable all of its researchers to disseminate their work.\\n 3. We will extend our collaboration with scholars, partners and other stakeholders through\\n original deployment of new technology.\\n Even before the impact of Covid-19, NTU was aware that the manner in which international\\n research collaborations were pursued was becoming unsustainable. NTU is developing a ‘Virtual\\n Institute of Advanced Studies’ to facilitate such collaborations, in part through its partnership with\\n Microsoft.\\n 4. We will accelerate our performance in commercialisation and consultancy to share our\\n insights in ways that benefit our partners, our society and our University.\\n NTU will select a small number of areas of intellectual property for the application of a new\\n model of external consultancy.\\n 3. People\\n Equality, Diversity and Inclusion\\n NTU’s commitment to EDI is deep-rooted and led from the top. In 2014, the incoming VC\\n created and chaired an EDI Steering Group to champion initiatives: an institution-wide campaign\\n                                                                                                 Page 5\\n\\n\\n promoting respect as a core value; staff networks promoting the perspectives of Women,\\n Disability, LGBT+ and BAME; and the launch of a mandatory unconscious bias online training\\n module. More recently, transgender awareness and white privilege training have taken place for\\n key staff groups, including the University Executive Team.\\n In April 2019, NTU secured Athena SWAN Institutional Bronze Award, one of the KPIs set by the\\n Board of Governors. This recognition is in part based on a four-year action plan resourced with\\n circa £750,000 of targeted financial investment. Components implemented included:\\n • funding 15 Aurora places each year for female academics;\\n • paying for an Athena Swan Champion in every academic school;\\n • providing personal mentoring to female associate professors to accelerate their applications for\\n promotion; and\\n • creating ‘Women in Academia’ that supports all women as they pursue their research and\\n career goals.\\n NTU has a comprehensive schedule for Athena Swan accreditation for academic departments,\\n with Psychology and Sports Science receiving their Bronze Awards in November 2019 and\\n October 2020, respectively.\\n NTU is a member of Stonewall’s Diversity Champions, holds Disability Confident Employer\\n status, and has enrolled in Advance HE’s Race Equality Charter. In December 2020, it published\\n its Race Equality Action Plan. This incorporates a VC Mentoring Scheme for associate professors\\n who identify as BAME. NTU champions transparency: ethnicity pay gap data are published\\n alongside annual gender pay gap reporting.\\n NTU data illustrate that amongst senior roles, inclusive of academic roles, both women and\\n BAME colleagues are underrepresented. NTU has set explicit targets to increase female\\n representation within the professoriate and improve BAME representation within leadership\\n positions.\\n All colleagues are eligible to make flexible working requests under the Flexible Working (Right to\\n Request) Policy. This policy is complemented by Parental Leave and Special Leave policies.\\n NTU has a Support for Academic Returners scheme which provides individual awards of £5k to\\n help academics re-establish their research after returning from caring responsibilities.\\n NTU runs a biennial staff survey. The 2018 survey found that that NTU’s key strengths as an\\n employer are: appraisals; a safe and secure working environment; supportive work colleagues;\\n and high levels of staff satisfaction with their work and the quality of service they deliver to\\n students and others. 91% of staff gave a positive response on questions related to equality of\\n opportunity. NTU’s CROS (Careers in Research, Online Survey) 2019 results showed that over 94%\\n of early-career research staff agreed the University is committed to equality and diversity.\\n Appraisal Process\\n These positive perceptions are underpinned by NTU’s appraisal system, where institutional\\n ambitions are balanced with individual aspirations. Completion rates of appraisals are another\\n institutional KPI, with 98.5% conducted in 2019.\\n Appraisals have two components: the agreement of personal objectives; and the definition of\\n support and development that will enable delivery. During this REF cycle, we have implemented\\n three career pathways which mean every academic possesses the objectives best suited to their\\n focus: Teaching and Practice; Teaching and Research; and Teaching and Scholarship.\\n Consulted on with staff and agreed with NTU’s University and College Union branch, it was\\n introduced fully in 2018/19. Academics on the Teaching and Research Pathway have significant\\n responsibility for research and are given workload allowance for research. They develop their\\n                                                                                                  Page 6\\n\\n\\n appraisal objectives through working with ADRs and Research Centre Directors to produce an\\n annual Individual Research Plan. This framework facilitates the setting of research objectives\\n appropriate to both career stage and discipline. It underpins a financial reward system that\\n recognises outstanding and exceptional contributions by academic colleagues each year.\\n This approach to appraisal is the foundation of other important activities that promote and\\n recognise research. These include School-led sabbatical schemes - 88 since 2014 - and the\\n Vice-Chancellor’s Outstanding Researcher Awards (since 2015/16, 25 recipients have also been\\n given small grants to accelerate their research.)\\n This appraisal process has enabled: streamlining probation and progression from entry at\\n lecturer level to top of senior lecturer scale; ensuring academic promotion is based on\\n transparent performance criteria; and movement within professorial bands - and creation of\\n Distinguished Professors - rooted in individual contributions.\\n Thus, appraisal lies at the heart of our commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion:\\n progression, promotion, recognition and reward are based solely on merit.\\n Support and Development for PGRs and Early Career Researchers\\n NTU received the HR Excellence in Research Award in January 2013 and endorses the revised\\n Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. Adherence is managed through\\n the Concordat Management Group, overseen by University Research Committee. In 2017 NTU\\n introduced School Concordat Champions to embed this work at a local level. The most recent\\n external peer review of the University’s policies and practices related to the Concordat praised\\n the “considerable buy-in of the senior management and the Board of Governors” which in its\\n view had “clearly impacted on the pace of change and the culture of research at NTU”.\\n NTU has established a termly ECR Forum which encourages researchers to share their views\\n and undertake personal and professional development This provides rolling induction for new\\n researchers, an opportunity to update on the Valuing Ideas strategic theme, and a platform to\\n raise issues. This forum includes training and information sessions such as: Communicating\\n Research; Career Development; Understanding the REF; and Open Access and Responsible\\n Use of Metrics.\\n NTU has developed a bespoke “Winning Grant Funding” programme for early-career\\n researchers. This trains ~30 early-career researchers in biennial cohorts by providing\\n mentorship and masterclasses on proposal development, pathways to impact and development\\n of external partnerships; 50% of attendees have gone on to secure significant or high-esteem\\n grant funding.\\n All researchers have access to a comprehensive suite of blended training and development\\n mapped to the Researcher Development Framework. Attendance data show an annual average\\n of 490 individual instances. The latest CROS data show that 72% of ECRs agree that the\\n University encourages them to engage in personal and career development.\\n The NTU Doctoral School (DS) is responsible for doctoral training and administration. All\\n doctoral candidates are supervised by at least two supervisors to oversee research planning and\\n progress, with 12 mandatory meetings each year. Doctoral researchers produce interim and\\n annual monitoring reports to ensure timely progression. The University’s rate of full-time\\n submission within four years was 78% in 2017/18.\\n All doctoral researchers enrol on NTU Doctorate Plus. This comprises a comprehensive\\n annual programme of workshops, training and events designed to support personal and\\n professional development, complementing school and research centre provision. NTU records\\n an annual average of 980 individual bookings and satisfaction rates scored 3.2% above the\\n                                                                                              Page 7\\n\\n\\n global sector benchmark in 2019. The DS organises an annual Doctoral Research Festival,\\n which shows attendance regularly above 30% of the doctoral community.\\n NTU has worked hard to ensure PGR representation on research-related committees at school\\n and institutional levels. The DS hosts a regular forum to ensure open communication with the\\n doctoral community. A Nottingham Trent Students Union (NTSU) sabbatical officer attends PGR\\n induction and feedback events and PGR students are a key constituency in the NTU Student\\n Voice campaign. NTSU has supported the election of PGR Student Representatives since\\n September 2017 and co-delivers Student Representative training and development. Locally,\\n PGR students are actively involved in organising seminar series and school research\\n conferences.\\n 4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n Research Activity and Income\\n NTU views research income generation as both a key indicator of peer-esteem and a vital\\n method of generating research excellence and strong impact. During this REF period, research\\n grant spend per annum has risen by 40% despite lockdown reducing income in 2019-20.\\n   Year                             Institutional Income           HESA data (million)\\n                                    (million)\\n   2019-20                          £330                           £7.0\\n   2018-19                          £313                           £7.4\\n   2017-18                          £290.3                         £7.2\\n   2016-17                          £271.8                         £6.7\\n   2015-16                          £258.5                         £6\\n   2014-15                          £225.4                         £5.9\\n   2013-14                          £213.2                         £5.0\\n NTU’s investment in research development capacity, allied to a co-ordinated approach to the\\n management of research support processes, procedures and policies, have supported NTU\\n researchers in submitting more and better applications to external funders. In the academic year\\n before these investments took full effect - 2016/17 - 395 applications totalled £38.5 million. Of\\n these, 115 (29%) were successful, resulting in £5.7 million of new awards. In 2019/20, 477\\n applications were submitted, totalling £94.5m. Of these, 126 (26.42%) were successful, resulting in\\n £13.7 million of future research income.\\n NTU has deployed QR income strategically through complementary processes:\\n 1. Institutional Research Themes: £1.8 million has been allocated across the five research\\n priorities so interdisciplinary teams can develop responses to key challenges; and\\n 2. School Research Plans: £18.9m has been distributed to each school for allocation locally\\n against agreed objectives;\\n Both processes have included significant funding for pilot studies or early stage projects which\\n have contributed to the development of more substantial, often multi-partner and multi-\\n disciplinary, projects with associated external funding applications.\\n Overall, in the REF period, over £25m of QR has been invested to develop research.\\n Infrastructure and Facilities\\n In Spring 2019, NTU launched a research lifecycle Research Information Management\\n                                                                                                Page 8\\n\\n\\n System (Worktribe). This £1.14 million investment represented a step change in the\\n management of research, supporting growth in research activity and impact and assisting\\n compliance with external funders’ regulatory requirements. It is used to process, manage and\\n report on all applications for external research income.\\n £45 million has been invested in capital schemes which have transformed research capacity.\\n At the Clifton campus, research facilities available to physical and life sciences have been\\n enriched as part of wider schemes:\\n     \\uf0b7   £11m Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Engagement Centre (ISTEC), supported\\n         by a £5m contribution from HEFCE, to provide significant additional laboratory space;\\n     \\uf0b7   £23m dual-site MTIF supported by £9.7m from the D2N2 LEP; and\\n     \\uf0b7   £23m Engineering Building which houses laboratories, workshops and studios.\\n There has been major investment in equipment, for example a cutting-edge\\n dedicated Imaging Suite, featuring:\\n     \\uf0b7 Atomic force microscope (Dimension ICON AFM, purchased 2016 for £185k);\\n     \\uf0b7 Scanning electron microscope (Jeol FEG SEM JSM-7100F + EDX, purchased 2015 for\\n         £250k); and\\n     \\uf0b7 Transmission electron microscope (Jeol JEM 2010 TEM, replaced 2019 for £640k)\\n On the City campus, research facilities have been expanded for a range of disciplines,\\n including £2.3m for SoSS psychology research and £510k for ADBE to refurbish and re-equip\\n laboratory space.\\n At Brackenhurst, the School of Animal, Rural and Environmental Sciences has benefited\\n from:\\n     \\uf0b7 £820k poultry nutrition unit;\\n     \\uf0b7 £280k glassshouse, growth rooms and container farm for vertical farming research;\\n     \\uf0b7 £230k integrated water energy food facility; and\\n     \\uf0b7 New research labs for environmental and geospatial research as part of a £12m teaching\\n         and research centre.\\n                                                                                              Page 9\\n', 'w_env']\n",

      "['University of Huddersfield\\n 1. Context and mission\\n The University of Huddersfield (UoH) was designated university status in 1992. It is a member of\\n UUK and Yorkshire Universities and a signatory to the UPP Civic University Agreement. UoH is\\n a major employer in the Leeds City Region and considered an anchor institution. Regional\\n challenges impact on the establishment of private and public sector collaborative research\\n initiatives, where GVA per capita falls 10-15% below the national average (excluding London)\\n and limits the extent to which organisations are prepared to commit.\\n The University’s seven academic schools undertake a broad range of research with particular\\n emphasis on STEM, humanities, social sciences, business, art and design. Over the REF\\n period, total research spend p/a has more than trebled, reaching £17M in the FY19/20. We have\\n a number of well-established REF and RAE assessed research areas, whilst others, including\\n drama, law, architecture, sports science and psychology, will make their first submission in 2021.\\n Schools are supported by seven support services overseen by the Vice-Chancellor’s Office. 43%\\n of our 1922 FTE employed staff are academics, 15% of which are professorial level. All\\n academics are expected to be research active and this is reflected in job descriptions and\\n workload allocations. By 2025, the end of the current strategy period, all staff are expected to\\n publish research of at least 2* quality, building on the previous 2013-2018 strategy, requiring\\n staff to publish at, or better than, national level. All academic staff, except a very small number\\n on practitioner contracts, are returned to HESA categories of Teaching and Research or\\n Research Only. No academic staff are on teaching only contracts.\\n In 2019/20, overall student numbers (UG, PGT and PGR) were 14,857 (FTE) of which 16% were\\n international and 5% postgraduate researchers. Total turnover in 2019/20 was ~£174M of which\\n £18.8M was combined Research (£16.9M) and Enterprise (£1.9M) income.\\n Historically, focus has been on teaching quality, with UoH rated Gold in the 2017 TEF, and\\n presented with the Advance HE Global Teaching Excellence Award. Our 2008 Strategy shift\\n towards research, resulted in an unprecedented increase in research power in the 2014 REF, with\\n 262 academic staff submitted, representing a 143% increase on 2008 - the third strongest\\n performance in the UK.\\n REF2021 encompasses two institutional Strategy Map periods. The 2013-18 research aims\\n were:\\n      \\uf0b7   To strengthen and enhance our research capability\\n      \\uf0b7   To contribute to economic, social and cultural development\\n      \\uf0b7   To enrich teaching through research and innovation excellence\\n Performance targets included: a four-fold increase in research grant and contract income;\\n doubling of high-quality outputs and PGR completions, and increasing the professoriate by\\n 40FTE. Our mature research disciplines in engineering, music, humanities and social sciences\\n were major contributors, achieving recognition, e.g. through two Queen’s Anniversary prizes in\\n music and rail.\\n                                                                                                 Page 1\\n\\n\\n The University’s 2025 Vision is to be ‘an inspiring, innovative university of international renown’,\\n by becoming research intensive and recognised in world top 300 rankings. Our Institutional\\n Strategy is to increase research activity through international and end user partnerships and\\n developing the necessary supporting environment for academic staff.\\n 2. Strategy\\n University Research Strategy\\n The University Research Strategy sits beneath the overarching institutional Strategy Map. Our\\n ambition is to deliver excellent research and impact that contributes to important advances in\\n human knowledge and improvements to the global quality of life. The University Research\\n Committee, chaired by the PVC R&E reporting to Senate, is responsible for its oversight and\\n delivery.\\n Our Research Strategy embraces interdisciplinary societal and economic grand challenges\\n organised into thematic Areas of Strategic Research Importance (ASRIs). These are defined as\\n themes where we evidentially have expertise, critical mass and assets to develop new and\\n emerging areas of research (e.g. engineering systems, data science, materials, health and\\n wellbeing, productivity, security, sustainable environment and creativity). The ASRI portfolio is\\n overseen by the University Research Committee and informs internal resource allocation\\n (University Research Fund, URF) and institutional support. Over the REF period, the University\\n has invested ~£7.9M URF to support delivery of the Research Strategy.\\n The 2013-18 research aims described earlier were all achieved. By 2025, the University aims to\\n accelerate this research intensity by increasing its number of international research partnerships,\\n the volume and quality of research outputs, citations and research income, and strengthening\\n relationships with industry and end users of research. To facilitate this, the University has a\\n delivery plan to create a supportive research environment, aspects of which are detailed below:\\n Research Integrity\\n The University is committed to the principles of the Concordat to Support Research Integrity and\\n since 2013 has produced annual integrity statements demonstrating institutional compliance with\\n principles. The institutional Code of Practice for Research, research ethics and integrity policy\\n and annual statements are publicly available on the University website. The annual narrative\\n statement is approved by University Research Committee, reporting to Senate and University\\n Council. The current action plan responds directly to the revised 2019 Concordat. Our Code of\\n Practice for Research is adapted from the UK Research Integrity Office’s Code of Practice for\\n Research and supports researchers in conducting research of the highest quality. The Code\\n provides general principles and standards for good practice in research, including excellence,\\n honesty, integrity, co-operation, accountability, safety, training and skills.\\n All academic schools have designated Research Integrity Champions and Research Ethics and\\n Integrity Committees operating within the University Research Integrity framework. School\\n research ethics, integrity activities and associated action plans are reviewed annually by URC.\\n Governance web pages provide key information and access to training for staff and students.\\n The University recognises the importance of training to raise awareness and enable cross-UoA\\n                                                                                                 Page 2\\n\\n\\n discussion. All UoAs and Central Service Staff have attended 1-day workshops and on-line\\n research integrity Epigeum training packages are available to all staff and students.\\n The University of Huddersfield Press is committed to promoting research and publication\\n integrity, as defined in the COPE Code of Practice. The Press ensures that all research outputs\\n are thoroughly reviewed by expert reviewers. All of our journals adhere to the COPE guidelines\\n for best practice.\\n Open Research\\n The University is committed to ensuring publicly funded research is openly accessible,\\n transparent, collaborative and efficient. We have invested in access to systems to facilitate Open\\n Research, including but not limited to the Elsevier PURE management information system and a\\n University Data Repository and content management system (Box). All staff are encouraged to\\n adopt a unique ORCiD identifier to facilitate sharing and establish transparent and trustworthy\\n connections between researchers. Specific Open Research activities are summarised below.\\n Open Access (OA) is an institutional priority as set out in the OA Policy. During the REF period,\\n an internal OA audit was commissioned to review current OA processes and procedures. As a\\n consequence, a central OA Manager was appointed to improve information and assist in the\\n delivery of mandatory central training for staff and students and to support the wider open\\n research strategy. The Elsevier PURE management information system became the single point\\n of truth for all research outputs and for OA compliance checks. UoH participates in the annual\\n Open Access Week to raise the profile and importance of OA to staff and students. The UoH\\n Press, established in 2007, supports emerging researchers and helps foster research\\n communities by providing a platform for developing academic areas. OA publishing is actively\\n promoted by UoH Press e.g. Music Beyond Airports, a collection of essays developed from\\n papers given at the 2019 Ambient@40 International Conference, has received over 12591\\n downloads and 586 eBook views as a result of our utilisation of standardised metadata,\\n international indexing platforms and a tailored promotional campaign.\\n UoH supports the Concordat’s principles on Open Research Data and broadening opportunities\\n for high-quality research findings, to be widely disseminated and freely available. The UoH\\n Research Data Management Policy outlines the expectations for fulfilling our commitment to the\\n Concordat, including requirements for data curation. Guidance and advice for researchers on\\n managing the open access of data, including issues arising from ethics considerations and IP\\n rights, is available to staff. A dedicated RDM officer is employed to assist academic staff in\\n making data open and accessible. To date, resources have been focused on externally funded\\n research projects providing RDM support for grant holders, including data storage and\\n publication of DOIs for datasets. Data sets , including the AHRC project ‘Mixing it - Diversity in\\n Second World War Britain’ and EUICIT Open Access transcripts, are externally accessible via\\n the PURE portal.\\n Interdisciplinary Research\\n The University recognises the importance of interdisciplinary research from both an innovation\\n perspective and individual researcher career development. A number of centrally funded\\n initiatives have been implemented to support this, e.g. the University Research Fund (URF) has\\n                                                                                                Page 3\\n\\n\\n supported ASRI development and the establishment of interdisciplinary research institutes such\\n as the Secure Societies, Materials and Skin Integrity & Infection Prevention institutes. The URF\\n has also supported interdisciplinary research projects, identified through challenge ‘sandpits’,\\n that focus on the Global Grand Challenges and UK Industry Strategy Challenges – all seven\\n academic schools have proactively secured funding for challenge-based projects. Over the REF\\n period we have invested ~£3.6M of URF to support interdisciplinary research. Specific initiatives\\n include PhD stipends for projects with cross-school supervisory teams. Our EPSRC\\n Multidisciplinary Research Equipment grant (EP/T02433X/1) and EPSRC DTP awards\\n (EP/N50967X/1, EP/R513234/1) have been strategically invested into multidisciplinary\\n materials related research across three academic schools - Computing & Engineering, Applied\\n Sciences and Art, Design & Architecture.\\n Collaboration\\n The University Strategy Map addresses the importance of research collaboration, with specific\\n aims to increase partnerships and collaborations with end users of research and international\\n partners. By 2025, our target is for 15% of research outputs to be generated in collaboration with\\n end users and 60% with international collaborators - current achievement is 5.6% and 45.5%\\n respectively. To facilitate collaborative relationships, URF funding (£1.4M) has been invested in\\n ECR and academic staff sabbaticals, exchanges and international conference attendance. Our\\n QR GCRF funding (£532k) has supported partnerships with Universities and end-users in ODA\\n countries and research has been undertaken in countries including Ethiopia, Indonesia, Uganda\\n and Jamaica. Our collaborative ODA research was awarded a Newton Prize (2019) and over the\\n REF period we have secured 37 EU grants with 349 international collaborators.\\n The University has strong national and regional collaborations and is an active partner in\\n Yorkshire Universities (YU). As YU partners we have participated in Science and Innovation\\n Audits for Medtech and more recently rail. HEIF CCF funding (£5M) was secured for the\\n Translate and GrowMedtech schemes and 4 of our academic schools have secured funding. A\\n Medtech Leadership Board has been established and MoU signed with partners across the\\n region and UoH is an active collaborator and partner. The University has also collaborated in two\\n Strength in Places applications (Medtech and advanced manufacturing) with HEI partners and\\n end-users.\\n Delivering Impact\\n The University’s Research Strategy commits to delivering excellent research with impact. This\\n commitment is recognised in academic promotion criteria, which evidences the importance of\\n enterprise, impact and public engagement. Our aim is to conduct research that delivers direct\\n economic and societal benefits to the communities we support, and we are committed to the\\n principles of the Concordat for Public Engagement with Research. UoH is a signatory of the UPP\\n Civic University Agreement to drive regional and local impact and in 2019 conducted an\\n institutional Joseph Rowntree impact assessment and a UNIAC Public Engagement Audit to\\n inform development of our Public Impact and Engagement strategy. Research Strategy impact\\n aims are:\\n     \\uf0b7 To increase our economic impact by becoming a focus for productivity improvement,\\n          impact and enterprise regionally, nationally and internationally;\\n     \\uf0b7 To enhance our societal impact as an anchor and civic university to engage with key\\n          communities and enhance quality of life, effectiveness of public policy and services and\\n          the well-being of individuals.\\n                                                                                               Page 4\\n\\n\\n      \\uf0b7  To develop impact tracking and evaluation methodologies which can be used to monitor\\n         long term economic and societal impacts of our research.\\n      \\uf0b7  To embed responsible innovation approaches in our research practice from project\\n         design and execution to delivery, dissemination and ongoing impact monitoring.\\n      \\uf0b7  To secure increased external funding for research impact delivery.\\n Section 3 outlines our commitment to supporting and enabling researchers to deliver impact\\n from their research.\\n 3.

The importance of the PGR\\n community was recognised as a KPI in the University Strategy (2013 – 2018) when we\\n successfully increased our PGR community to 1000+ FTEs. Over the REF2021 period, 995\\n completions have been recorded and current PGR headcount is 1383.\\n PGR scholarships are available through several schemes including: VC’s Fee Waiver\\n Scholarship, EPSRC DTP awards (EP/N50967X/1, EP/R513234/1, EP/T51813X/1); EPSRC\\n NPIF, Industrial CASE studentships, Leverhulme DTC, AHRC Heritage Consortium CDT,\\n University Alliance DTAs in Applied Biosciences for Healthcare, Social Policy and an associated\\n EU COFUND scheme. Internal QR and URF funding has been allocated strategically to support\\n bursaries in priority research areas URF funding (£380k) has supported 19 student transitions\\n from Masters to PhD.\\n Student Engagement and Training\\n UoH is a member of the UK Council for Graduate Education. We collaborate with external\\n partners to provide a wide choice of training for PGR e.g. the North-West and Yorkshire Training\\n Group, the University Alliance DTA programme, the NPL Postgraduate Institute and the Network\\n of Expert Researcher Developers. PGR student enrichment is supported by our investment in\\n international conference attendance, development of PGR concepts and ideas, and\\n provision for an annual PGR Conference. A PGR Careers Officer also mentors students with\\n career choices.\\n PGR feedback and consultation is managed through Graduate Council which meets six times a\\n year. Our Researcher Environment Team coordinates PGR induction and training requirements\\n and coordinates PRES surveys. All PGR courses are mapped to the Vitae RDF and designed to\\n support students through their entire research journey. In addition, RDF has been used in PGR\\n supervisor training to increase awareness of it - one third of those eligible to supervise in 2017-\\n 2019 received training.\\n                                                                                                Page 7\\n\\n\\n Equality and Diversity (EDI)\\n The University Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity Enhancement Committee reports to Senate and\\n oversees the implementation of University EDI related policies, Code of Practice and\\n frameworks for staff and students. In 2020, the University signed up to the Race Equality Charter\\n (REC) and completed the Investing in Ethnicity Maturity Matrix to inform the REC action plan. In\\n 2018, UoH was accredited as a Disability Confident Employer and was a signatory to the Mindful\\n Employer Charter, it is also a Stonewall Champion and participated in the Stonewall Equality\\n Index in 2019. The University has four staff networks (LGBTQI+, BAME, Women and Disability)\\n run by members with support from the University EDI Officer.\\n In 2015, UoH was awarded Athena SWAN Bronze and this has been renewed. Schools with\\n Athena SWAN awards are Applied Sciences (Silver), Music Humanities and Media (Bronze) and\\n Huddersfield Business School (Bronze). In 2017, at the AS conference ‘Equality: Everyone’s job,\\n no-one’s responsibility’, Prof. Dame Julia King DBE FREng was keynote speaker. Female staff\\n are encouraged to participate in the Advance HE Aurora programme and some staff act as\\n Aurora role models.\\n The University participates in Vitae’s ‘Every Researcher Counts’ to improve equality and\\n diversity for researchers and our Head of Researcher Environment participates in national\\n equality and diversity networks. EDI is integral to our commitment to the Concordat to Support\\n the Career Development of Researchers and our HR Excellence in Research Action Plan e.g. an\\n EDI review of central research committees (see gender table below), and anonymous sift\\n exercises of grant applications to ensure quality-based selection without bias.\\n                        Committee                  Total     Percentage Percentage\\n                                                members          Male           Female\\n                  University Research               22           59%              41%\\n                        Committee\\n                    Graduate Board                  26           35%              65%\\n               University Research Group            11           64%              36%\\n              University Research Careers           14           50%              50%\\n                    Oversight Group\\n                  University Knowledge              20           55%              45%\\n                    Exchange Group\\n EDI is a priority within our REF2021 Code of Practice (CoP).

Appendix\\n 16A of the CoP contains the outcomes which led to the inclusion the University’s on-line\\n ‘unconscious bias’ and ‘diversity in the workplace’ modules as mandatory training for all staff\\n involved in decision making, in addition to bespoke mandatory EDI REF training. An Equality\\n Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out in May 2019, testing SRR/IR identification processes\\n and provided confidence that the processes were fair.

Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n Income generation strategy and support\\n Total research income for 2019-20 was £16.9M, representing a >3-fold increase since 2014, can\\n be broken down as follows:\\n                              Funder                            Percentage\\n                              UK Government and NHS             35.8%\\n                              UKRI and NIHR                     24.6%\\n                              IUK and Industry                  21.7%\\n                              EU                                10.4%\\n                              Charity                           5.6%\\n                              Overseas and Other                1.0%\\n                              Local Government                  0.8%\\n The distribution of income sources reflects the University strategy to conduct collaborative\\n research with end-users. For example, ~60% of income falls within this category (IUK, Industry,\\n UK Government and NHS).\\n We plan to continue to focus on collaborative end-user R&D and secure funding for impact\\n delivery (e.g. Impact Acceleration Accounts). Enterprise income, from sources such as ERDF,\\n remains a priority to facilitate impact. We will target initiatives to support our growing population\\n of ECRs and seek alternatives to EU funding (~10% income).\\n Internal funding will support new partnerships and facilitate impact with end users. Over the\\n period we allocated >£1M/annum URF to support our ASRI portfolio, capability growth,\\n internationalisation programme and as match funding for external grants. We expect this level of\\n commitment to continue. A Strategic Partnership Fund to facilitate relationships with external\\n organisations has been created where UoH and external partners fund research programmes\\n equally. Key partners include: RSSB, Paxman Coolers, Renishaw and YES Tequila.\\n A portfolio of schemes, infrastructure and resources exist to support development of grant\\n applications, impact delivery and establishment of collaborative partnerships.\\n Infrastructure, resources and facilities\\n To support staff developing grant applications, we have a central pre-award team with Research\\n Development Managers (RDMs) assigned to schools. A central post-award finance and\\n contracts team assist in the management of successful awards. RDMs delivered challenge-type\\n sand pit events to facilitate pan-institutional interdisciplinary collaborations and funding used to\\n pump-prime research proposals. Some have secured external grant funding e.g. AHRC Life-\\n Saving Lullabies project working with women in Zambia. Since 2016 the University has received\\n EPSRC DTP and NPIF funding (EP/N50967X/1, EP/R513234/1, EP/R51228X/1, EP/S515425/1)\\n and the central Research & Enterprise directorate oversees the management of these including\\n strategy development and grant reporting.\\n Investment in University estate and facilities has significantly enhanced the research\\n environment. For example, in 2017, the Oastler Building (£27M) was constructed for the School\\n                                                                                                  Page 9\\n\\n\\n of Music, Humanities and Media and in 2019 the Barbara Hepworth Building (£30M) for Art,\\n Design and Architecture. As well as research facilities, buildings house dedicated PGR study\\n areas and PGR admin staff offices. Dedicated research facilities, such as a full-scale test rig for\\n the Rail Research Institute and the EPSRC MIAMI Ion Beam Facility have been constructed.\\n Other major facilities include the Spatial and Interactive Research Laboratory (SPIRAL) including\\n recording studios and the Phipps Concert Hall and the Centre for Precision Technology (CPT)\\n which is home to the EPSRC Future Advanced Metrology Hub (EP/P006930/1). Additional\\n equipment, purchased via an EPSRC Multidisciplinary Research Equipment Investment grant\\n (EP/T02433X/1), supports staff across two schools. To showcase facilities and to access a wider\\n portfolio of equipment elsewhere, we use the National Centre for Universities and Business\\n Confer system.\\n Other buildings, including the Holocaust Exhibition and Learning Centre, Sovereign Design\\n House Art Gallery and the 3M Buckley Innovation Centre (3M BIC), have been opened to\\n facilitate impact from research. The 3M BIC has been recognised in national reviews including\\n Lord Young’s 2014 report ‘Enterprise for All’ and the 2017 BEIS Industrial Strategy Made\\n Smarter report. The HLF funded Heritage Quay archive facility (opened 2014) houses collections\\n encompassing: British music 19th-21st century, sport, education, politics, art and design, theatre\\n and literature.\\n We have invested in computer systems to support research including; the Elsevier PURE\\n Research Management Information System, Skills Forge for PGR training and supervision\\n monitoring and Microsoft Dynamics for tracking collaborative R&D and enterprise activities. In\\n addition, researchers are allocated Box Data Storage system licences.\\n Reproducibility of research is generally addressed through internal peer review of all research\\n outputs ahead of publication. In one specific area, the CPT and EPSRC Future Advanced\\n Metrology Hub, reproducibility of research is critical for the development of national ISO\\n standards. The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is a strategic partner and PGR students\\n developing new physical metrology and machine tool ISO standards are co-supervised by NPL\\n staff.\\n Benefits In-kind\\n The School of Computing and Engineering has benefited from equipment donations that\\n significantly contribute to the research environment, e.g. the STFC Medium Energy Ion Source\\n (MEIS) which was rebuilt and became operational in 2015. MEIS forms part of the UK National\\n Ion Beam Centre, funded by EPSRC, along with the MIAMI facility. Siemens also donated an\\n ONIAC tandem particle accelerator to the ion beam centre at Huddersfield.\\n In the areas of engineering and innovation, strategic partner Renishaw, provided significant\\n discount on a metal 3D printing AM facility dedicated for research and has installed, free of\\n charge, metrology software for in-process measurement.\\n Academic researchers in Applied Sciences have accessed national HPC facilities such as\\n HECToR and ARCHER for computational chemistry simulations and NERC research ships for\\n the study of Arctic climate systems. Social scientists share their research using the UK Data\\n Service.\\n                                                                                             Page 10\\n\\n\\n Impact Support\\n UoH is committed to the principles of the Concordat for Public Engagement with Research and\\n delivering impact from its research. In 2019, we signed the Civic University Agreement\\n recognising our role as an anchor institution and conducted a Joseph Rowntree Foundation\\n impact assessment to better understand the overall impact of the institution. The University\\n Knowledge Exchange Group, reporting to URC, was established to oversee areas such as\\n business and public engagement and IP commercialisation. Given the breadth of research\\n across our UoAs, impact extends across economic, social and academic boundaries and\\n substantial infrastructure has been established to support our staff and PGR.\\n Impact infrastructure:\\n Central staff supporting aspects of the impact agenda include:\\n      \\uf0b7   an Impact Manager advising academic researchers and school-based officers on delivery\\n          and monitoring of impact from research as well as impact training for staff.\\n      \\uf0b7   the Head of Business Development (HoBD) advising on IP protection and\\n          commercialisation. The HoBD also supports researchers securing funding from regional\\n          Medtech HEIF CCF schemes.\\n      \\uf0b7   the Head of Regional Business Engagement facilitates interaction with local businesses\\n          through ESIF programmes e.g. Manufacturing Supply Chain Programme (£5.4M)\\n          supporting 550 businesses.\\n      \\uf0b7   A dedicated KTP manager supports academic engagement with the IUK programme. In\\n          May 2020, UoH had 13 active KTPs across 4 academic schools.\\n      \\uf0b7   A part-time Public Engagement Officer leads the Public Impact and Engagement\\n          network. Events enable academics to share best practice in impact through public\\n          engagement.\\n Central funding (URF, QR GCRF, QR SPF and HEIF) supports our research impact related\\n activities. For example, in collaboration with the University of Leeds, an independent Science &\\n Innovation Audit in rail was commissioned to evaluate the opportunities for connecting our\\n collaborative rail research capabilities with northern rail innovation systems. In addition, over the\\n last three years, ~£400k Follow-On and Impact funding has been secured, primarily from AHRC,\\n for projects such as Gerhard Revealed (£80k) and the EU for Researchers Night (£146k).\\n The University’s 3M Buckley Innovation Centre is a major route to impact for several academic\\n schools. A spin-in model for co-location of businesses alongside UoH is adopted to facilitate\\n collaborative R&D e.g. NPL is an anchor tenant. The University showcases research strengths\\n to local companies and provides access to state-of-the art equipment such as metal 3D printing,\\n HPC, X-ray CT and imaging facilities. Equipment in the centre has been funded via a UoH Local\\n Growth Fund capital grant (£2.9M).\\n Staff and PGR impact training\\n Impact training sessions have been delivered by external providers including Fast Track Impact,\\n Vertigo Ventures, Bulletin Academic, Walcott Communications, NCCPE and Parliament\\n Outreach & Engagement Services. Training has encompassed topics such as individual impact\\n mapping, writing for impact, articulating impact, REF ICS development and delivering research\\n impact into policy. Training has been tailored to all stages of research career development, e.g.\\n                                                                                               Page 11\\n\\n\\n ECRs were centrally supported to participate in the NCCPE Researchers Academy. More than\\n 200 staff have undertaken impact related training. Our PGR students receive training from the\\n Director of Research & Enterprise and online resources are available on Brightspace. During\\n the REF period, 10 PGR sessions have been delivered and 122 students have attended.\\n External promotion and events\\n The University website and social media platforms (@HudReseach Twitter has 2794 followers)\\n regularly report research news stories and our dedicated PURE web portal enables promotion of\\n research activities. The UoH Discover Magazine showcases the diverse range of research\\n carried out and highlights economic and societal impact - 17 issues of Discover have been\\n published during the REF period, showcasing 119 projects. In addition, to promote our research\\n more widely, we subscribe to The Conversation magazine and 253 articles, written by 147\\n academics, have been published.\\n Events, workshops and networks are key vehicles for engaging with end users to facilitate\\n impact of research. For example, the EU H2020 Researchers Night event ‘Full STEAM Ahead’\\n ran in 2016 and 2017. Events showcased UoH interdisciplinary research and >3000 members of\\n the pubic visited on each occasion. To drive policy related impact of research, UoH has recently\\n become a member of the Universities Policy Engagement Network and is seeking to drive such\\n activity in partnership with Yorkshire Universities and West Yorkshire Combined Authority.\\n                                                                                           Page 12\\n', 'w_env']\n",
      "University of West London\n",
      "['University of West London\\n 1. Context and mission\\n The University of West London (UWL) is located on two campuses in Ealing and Brentford; which\\n along with the Berkshire Institute of Health in Reading, and the Drama Studio London, make up\\n the Group Holdings. UWL is structured into nine academic Schools and Colleges which bring\\n together cognate subject areas. As a progressive university with a student population of c14,000\\n and c800 permanent staff, its origins can be traced back the Lady Byron School of 1859 which\\n was founded to provide education for poor and disadvantaged children. Building on that heritage,\\n the University’s mission is to give all students access to three fundamental and transformative\\n rights - the rights to participation, inclusion, and enhancement.\\n UWL is situated at the heart of one of the most prosperous regions in the UK. West London has a\\n GDP value of over £73billion with more than 120,000 businesses including Cisco, GSK, Heathrow\\n Airport, Sky, and many more. This dynamic economy is served by a complex web of international\\n transport and infrastructure systems that forms a hub for investment and migration. This makes it\\n culturally and ethnically diverse with 46% of its inhabitants being born outside the UK. This,\\n combined with its relatively young demographic, creates a region of great dynamism. We have\\n capitalised on this highly diverse and vibrant socio-economic context to build strong partnerships\\n with industry, government organisations, and local stakeholders.\\n In terms of reputation, UWL has consistently been ranked as the best modern university in London\\n with the best NSS scores in the capital for the last two years. It is consistently ranked in the top\\n 50 in the Guardian and the Times/Sunday Times and its financial performance is regularly in the\\n top quartile; it also continues to be in the top 20 institutions for social and ethnic inclusion. It has\\n one of the most diverse student populations in the country with 53% the first in their family to\\n attend university, 63% mature on entry, 56% BAME, and 98% state school educated. Its staff\\n establishment, at census date, boasted the highest number of BAME and black professors per\\n head in the country (26% compared to 17% nationally of which 9% are black compared to 2% for\\n the UK as a whole.\\n 2. Strategy\\n 2.1 Research and impact strategy post-REF2014\\n Historically, the University’s research strengths were focused on limited areas of excellence;\\n originally Nursing and History in RAE 2001, and later predominantly Nursing as History was\\n disbanded (RAE 2008). The University’s successive strategic plans (Ambition 2013-2018 and\\n Achievement 2018-2023) built on these original research strengths whilst responding to the\\n demands of the London and national economy; and the submission reflects this. We are submitting\\n to seven units of assessment with 81 staff (75 FTE) which is double the 35.7 FTE across five units\\n of assessment (UOAs) submitted in REF 2014. Our submission covers Allied Health; Computer\\n Science; Engineering; Social Policy; Leisure and Tourism; Music; and Communication, Cultural\\n and Media studies. Our research areas, and engagement with local partners, are directly relevant\\n to bringing solutions to our own region’s economy. By way of an illustration, a recent report by\\n Oxford Economics shows that the West London area has been particularly affected by COVID-19\\n because of high degree of exposure in sectors where it has a large part of the market shares in\\n London (e.g., transport, wholesale, retail and manufacturing, health and social work, and scientific\\n and technical professions); all areas in which we carry out research.\\n The review of our REF14 entry highlighted challenges related to inadequate                     research\\n infrastructure; limited investment; low numbers of research active staff and doctoral         students;\\n inadequate research training and imperceptible career pathways; with very little               strategic\\n oversight. As a result, the 2015-2020 research strategy set-out a clear strategy              with key\\n                                                                                                   Page 1\\n\\n\\n performance indicators and metrics. The overall aim was to deliver useful knowledge with impact\\n by focussing on the following objectives:\\n     1. Identify and invest in selective inter-disciplinary research centres and connect high\\n          performing staff to them\\n     2. Expand research base and build capacity and infrastructure by concentrating on inter-\\n          institutional partnerships, the construction of specialist space and dissemination\\n          opportunities\\n     3. Engage with regional and national priorities, and make a significant contribution to the\\n          wider economy and society\\n     4. Link research to internal and external enterprise, innovation, and knowledge exchange;\\n          improve impact volume and value, and open research\\n     5. Develop and enhance staff capability by talent spotting, providing expert training\\n          programmes, clear career pathways, and support within a supportive, diverse and inclusive\\n          culture; and improved doctoral recruitment and completion\\n     6. Drive civic engagement, innovation, and knowledge exchange.\\n 1. Seven inter-disciplinary research centres/institutes were established alongside the\\n     longstanding Richard Wells Centre with an international reputation for research into infection\\n     control; and the West London Centre for Evidence-based Healthcare (specialising in\\n     Healthcare Systematic Reviews) located within Richard Wells. The new centres are: the\\n     European Institute for Person-Centred Healthcare; the Centre for Cybersecurity and\\n     Criminology; the National Centre for Gang Research; the Policy and Practice Research\\n     Institute for Screen and Music (PRISM); the Geller Institute for Ageing and Memory (IAM); the\\n     International Centre for Hospitality and Aviation Resilience Management (ICHARM) which\\n     includes the Centre for the Study of Human Trafficking; and the Faringdon Centre for Non-\\n     Destructive Testing. We opened the School of Biomedical Sciences, with a research portfolio\\n     congruent with our allied health work, and representing a £2.5m investment. We anticipate the\\n     opening of a medical school within the next 5 years.\\n 2. Infrastructure investment in research and laboratory facilities have been extended significantly\\n     (see above, and details in section 4). An impact infrastructure has been created including an\\n     Impact Group led by the Head of Research and Engagement to provide advice and reviews;\\n     and facilitate interactions with research users. This growth resulted in a c£6m recurrent spend\\n     per annum on research staff, and c£1m on doctoral scholarships. At census date, we had 46\\n     full Professors (20 in 2014) and 26 Associate Professors. 54% of permanent academic staff\\n     had a doctorate compared to 22% in 2014. In addition, we supplemented the Research and\\n     Enterprise Operations team with mentors, advisers, and reviewers. We have also established\\n     two commercial entities to stimulate research and knowledge exchange: the Westmont\\n     Enterprise Hub (£1.2m donation) and the West London Food Innovation Centre (a match-\\n     funded £1.46m ERDF-funded laboratory for food product development).\\n 3. We have been successful in generating research addressing a range of international, national\\n     and regional priorities:\\n     •    In allied health, I-Hydrate is an innovative project, helping care homes across the country\\n          address dehydration amongst their residents; our epic3 guidelines on healthcare-\\n          associated infection control have underpinned national standards; a large-scale systematic\\n          review was carried out on the contribution of nurses to improving the health and well-being\\n          of people with learning disabilities; a pilot trial took place of Energy5 for patients with\\n          diabetes; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Wellcome Trust, and UKRI funding\\n          was obtained. The Geller Institute for Ageing and Memory gained significant AHRC grants\\n                                                                                               Page 2\\n\\n\\n         to explore a ‘multisensory’ approach to promote public health guidance and support the\\n         wellbeing of people with dementia in care homes\\n     •   In tourism, our research investigates the 2012 Olympics legacy in relation to regional\\n         housing regeneration; we also run an international research project to combat Human\\n         Trafficking in the European hotel sector\\n     •   In social policy, our research impacted on the Metropolitan Police, many local forces, and\\n         the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) in relation to rape investigation, and\\n         county lines drug networks\\n     •   In the creative sphere, we produced pioneering work on record production techniques, and\\n         created an app affecting the way the public listens to music; PRISM, with the British Film\\n         Institute, worked on cultural preservation of under-recognised ‘genres’; our culture and\\n         media research is investigating the relationship between gender, work, and technology.\\n         We have recently been awarded a small British Academy grant (£9k) for a diachronic study\\n         of media supports in the advertising industry.\\n     •   In engineering and built-environment, we produced research on thermal measures to\\n         enhance building performance; and the use non-destructive engineering methods.\\n     •   In computer science, ground-breaking work was conducted into the value of human-\\n         centred systems design, and in cybersecurity.\\n 4. The University has provided strong and sustained support (see section 3) to academics\\n     bidding for external funding, resulting in increased volume and value in externally funded\\n     research; as well as commercial income from enterprise activities. The University presently\\n     works with some 6000 local businesses and an extensive range of industry partners,\\n     international collaborators and networks, government agencies; advocacy and policy\\n     networks; and key sector stakeholders. These activities and their outcomes are threaded\\n     throughout our units of assessment submissions. Our research shows impact on major\\n     corporations, policy bodies, sector organisations, and SMEs, in areas critical to society and\\n     the economy.\\n     Engagement with the open access agenda, supported by our Open Access Policy, provides a\\n     framework for funder and government open access compliance structured and monitored\\n     through regular reports to the University Research, Scholarship and Enterprise Committee\\n     (URSEC). Staff engagement was facilitated by providing bespoke training, and promoting a\\n     culture of openness in research. Repository operations are now at a steady pace, and two\\n     dedicated professional posts were created to support these activities. Just over 10% of the\\n     deposits are available with a Creative Commons license. This has been achieved without\\n     funding for paid Gold Open Access via Article Processing Charges (APCs), which will be an\\n     objective of the next strategy. The University journal New Vistas was founded in 2015 to\\n     encourage junior researchers and PGRs to disseminate their work and is now part of the Open\\n     Access UWL Press (2019). The University plans to expand its portfolio of UWL Press open\\n     publications in the future. The University has signed the San Francisco Declaration of\\n     Research Assessment (SF- DORA) in support of discipline-specific conventions in the\\n     assessment of research outputs, particularly in the humanities and creative disciplines.\\n 5. We introduced the Academic Employment Framework (AEF) in 2015 to enhance clarity and\\n     diversity in our employment framework; giving the opportunity for all academic staff to excel in\\n     their chosen area of expertise. The AEF gives equal value to research, scholarship and\\n     knowledge exchange (see section 3). This strategy has enabled us to increase the number of\\n     academic staff with doctorates; and the number of professors and associate professors (see\\n     objective 2), partly through the development of internal talent, and partly through judicious\\n                                                                                              Page 3\\n\\n\\n     external recruitment. Staff who have demonstrated a promising research trajectory are\\n     identified as ‘next generation’ researchers and provided with support and mentorship to\\n     develop their potential (see section 3). Our REF submission (e.g. UoAs03, 11 and 34)\\n     showcases examples of the successful transition of staff from their early careers to\\n     independent researchers. The annual QR funding has been used for sabbaticals and study\\n     leave, Research Office support, PhD support and bursaries, and to support New Vistas. The\\n     Graduate School was setup in 2015 (renamed Graduate Centre in late 2020) to deliver crucial\\n     support functions. It carries out administrative oversight of progress and progression; provides\\n     a comprehensive programme of training for doctoral students; runs a mandatory programme\\n     of supervisory training, and acts as an advisor to students and supervisors (see section 3).\\n 6. We engaged in a number of activities to drive innovation and knowledge exchange. This\\n     includes start-up support; backing to freelancers; the professional development of a skilled\\n     creative workforce across our constituencies; and knowledge creation and transfer into the\\n     technology market through our Westmont Enterprise Hub. We also generate activities to\\n     support SMEs in product innovation through our West London Food Innovation Centre\\n     (WLFIC), funded through a £1.4 million ERDF grant, match-funded by the University; this is an\\n     interdisciplinary centre working closely with the ICHARM Research Centre, and with\\n     colleagues in hospitality and allied health. In terms of logistics and transport, we have strong\\n     links with Heathrow Airport (as holders of the Heathrow archive, and a permanent public\\n     exhibition of its contents).\\n 2.2 Five-year research and impact plans\\n The main objectives for the next five years focus on:\\n     •    Securing more industry-based research collaborations and networks; growing our\\n          intellectual property base and maximising use and revenue via knowledge exchange\\n     •    Promoting equality and diversity in all aspects of our research activities\\n     •    Continuing to create a talent pipeline, recruiting high performing staff, and developing\\n          academic staff, supported by expert training and sabbatical systems\\n     •    Building capacity and infrastructure through partnerships, specialist space; and increasing\\n          our doctoral capacity to 400+ students\\n     •    Promoting equality and diversity in all aspects of our research activities\\n     •    Aligning Research and Knowledge Exchange Strategies, with clear target communities for\\n          impact\\n     •    Supporting the Open Research agenda including research data, and gold publishing.\\n 3. People\\n 3.1 Staffing strategy\\n The AEF was introduced to create a framework for nurturing and managing academic staff\\n expertise; it was deployed through an investment in people, facilities, and support. In addition to\\n teaching responsibilities, academic staff are required to engage with research, scholarship (e.g.\\n curriculum development, pedagogic innovation and dissemination) and/or knowledge exchange\\n activities. The AEF enabled Heads of School to tailor their staffing requirements to the needs of\\n students and the curriculum, generating a diverse pool of expertise. It allows them to be agile with\\n work loading (within given parameters); it also provides staff with the flexibility to review their focus\\n at different stages of their careers.\\n 3.2 Staff development\\n Research is supported through a strong central support infrastructure, complemented by\\n Schools/Colleges’ own research activities. Research and Enterprise Operations (REOps)\\n supports all research funding applications and impact development. It provides advice on topics\\n                                                                                                    Page 4\\n\\n\\n including brokerage of contacts; KTP identification; patents and commercialization; managing\\n research budgets; industry and user engagement. The Human Resources department offers\\n training on equality and diversity, well-being, appraisals, promotion, working with external\\n collaborators, developing leadership skills. It manages sabbaticals, study leave, and seed-funds\\n applications (supporting both research and impact activities); and holds funds for conference,\\n CPD, and internal and external courses, including MAs and PhDs. For example, in 2019-20, c£60k\\n was spent on CPD, courses leading to qualifications, and conferences. The Library offers training\\n and one-to-one support for open research; and has trained all staff on compliance. The\\n Communications department offers advice on working with the media; public engagement;\\n engaging with diverse audiences; using social media to influence; and lobbying strategies. The\\n Graduate School provides training for doctoral supervisors, ensuring dissemination of good\\n practice, understanding regulations and the VITAE framework, as well as UWL’s priorities and\\n regulations, EDI, research integrity, and the University’s Code of Practice for Research Students\\n and Supervisors. This policy defines the roles of supervisors and supervisees, and provides a\\n framework for ‘research in an atmosphere of scholarship and collegiality enabling students to\\n complete their degrees successfully within the time limits’ (p.1). Formal access, progression and\\n graduation requirements are stipulated in the University’s Research Degree regulations. The\\n University has insisted that this training be mandatory for all supervisors, recognising the crucial\\n role supervisors play in ensuring quality and timely completion. The Graduate School runs the\\n central programme of research training for PGR students throughout the entire period of their\\n registration. This includes discussions of the doctoral milestones and regulations; and a\\n programme including initial understanding of research methods, and advanced research methods\\n in the different discipline paradigms, research ethics and integrity, the VITAE framework,\\n managing a research project, doctoral writing, writing for publication; with many opportunities for\\n students to present their research in progress. An important priority has been to ensure completion\\n within 3 to 3.5 years; the Graduate School monitors doctoral students’ progress. PGRs also get\\n opportunities to teach (maximum 6 hours a week), under the mentorship of their supervisors.\\n The University runs three annual research days, including a Research Conference. This is led by\\n the PVC (Academic) and provides dissemination forums, and networking opportunities. For REF,\\n it has provided REF guidance sessions open to all; review opportunities; and discussions on the\\n Code of Practice. All UoA Leads have undertaken unconscious bias training.\\n 3.3 Equality and diversity\\n The University has an ethnically and gender diverse workforce, with 34% of staff from black and\\n minority ethnic backgrounds (significantly above the national average). 29% of academic staff are\\n from BAME backgrounds in contrast to 17% across the sector. Staff from BAME backgrounds can\\n succeed at all levels of the University as seen from the composition of our professoriate (see\\n section 1). Our ethnicity median pay gap at census date stood at 2.57%. Our gender pay gap\\n median is 0%; 50% of our academic staff are female (vs 49% sector average); 37% of our\\n professors are female (vs. a sector average of 27%), and 42% of the senior staff are female.\\n Our sickness procedures enable staff to remain on full pay for 6 months and half pay for another\\n six months. This can be extended when necessary. We support ‘Better Gyms’ and provide access\\n to an Employee Assistance Programme at discounted rates. Our Health and Wellbeing framework\\n includes advice and support on mental health awareness. We operate flexible working support for\\n remote working where needed, including for staff with parental and caring responsibilities, or other\\n specific circumstances. During COVID-19, we introduced regular briefings on health and well-\\n being, and good practice when working remotely.\\n We have a substantive EDI infrastructure (including the Equality, and Diversity Advisory Group –\\n EDAG - chaired by the University Secretary). We provide mandatory training covering all aspects\\n of EDI including inter alia ‘Dignity at Work’ and ‘Transgender’ rights. UWL subscribes to Advance\\n                                                                                               Page 5\\n\\n\\n HE and works with Stonewall (a LGBT equalities rights charity) to raise awareness of gender\\n issues. We are working towards the Athena Swan Gender Equality Chartermark. We are presently\\n working on a UKRI/OfS bid to improve access to doctoral education by Black students.\\n In terms of REF, we have followed the protocols described in our Code of Practice. The REF Task\\n Group, and all REF Leads, have received equality and unconscious-bias training. Three formative\\n equality impact assessments took place. These have been reported to EDAG and URSEC. Staff\\n with protected characteristics were shown to suffer no obvious disadvantage. The research\\n development opportunities available – e.g., research funding, sabbaticals, conference funding -\\n always state the conditions and criteria applied. There is a transparent process and clear briefs\\n for all applications. Access to HR-managed research support described in 3.2 follow established\\n procedures and are open to all staff meeting the relevant criteria. In terms of doctoral students,\\n recruitment is based on regulations that specify entry requirements, and interviews are held by a\\n panel including supervisors and the Graduate School to ensure consistency across the institution.\\n Final registration to PhD status (transfer) is overseen by the University Research Degrees Sub-\\n Committee\\n 4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n There has been significant investment to support research income and impact. The appointment\\n of a Head of Research and Engagement, and the expansion of the REOps team have been\\n important factors. Notably the appointments/promotions of 26 Professors and 20 Associate\\n Professors and the opening of seven new research centres signals the ground covered.\\n 4.1 Research income\\n Our income generation strategy is based on mechanisms including: training, monitoring, peer-\\n review, study leave, sabbaticals, ‘cradle to grave’ support for bid applications; incentives to\\n collaborate internally and externally; and investment in laboratories and other research facilities.\\n We support in equal measure applications to research councils, government departments, private\\n organisations, and charitable foundations, regardless of the volume of grant applied for.\\n The number of grant applications has grown significantly over the REF period, and included\\n submissions to UKRI (EPSRC; ESRC; AHRC; Innovate UK); Strength in Places; NIHR;\\n Leverhulme; Wellcome Trust; British Academy; Alzheimer’s Society; British Heart Foundation and\\n Horizon 2020. The University also supported staff in responding to the urgent needs arising from\\n COVID-19. Thirteen bids were submitted by the end of period, including major proposals to the\\n NIHR on infection prevention and control (£380k), to the Natural Environment Research Council\\n (NERC) on respiratory health, and to UKRI on promoting the wellbeing of people with dementia in\\n care homes (£417k). This was in addition to smaller bids; e.g. assessing impact on ‘county lines’\\n drug crime.\\n 4.2 Examples of donations and grants from foundations to support research\\n     infrastructure\\n Leisure and Tourism (2016-17):         £120K and £100K to appoint two professorial chairs in\\n Hospitality\\n Heathrow Archive and Exhibition (2016-19): £200K from Heathrow airport and HLF to preserve\\n the archives and create a permanent public exhibition\\n Dementia and Art (2017-19): £89,337 from trusts and foundations, charities, care homes,\\n galleries, museums and individuals for collaborative research on living with dementia\\n Ground Penetrating Radar in Arborology (2017-20): c£430K to develop methodologies\\n applying ground penetrating radar in the assessment of the health of ancient trees at risk of\\n disease.\\n                                                                                             Page 6\\n\\n\\n Westmont Enterprise Hub (2016-20): £1.2m from two donors to establish a Hub to support start-\\n ups\\n Geller Institute of Ageing and Memory (2018): £1m from a single donor to set up the Institute\\n Healthcare: Health Institute Society Grant (2019): £65K for research on minimising the risk of\\n hospital patients developing non-ventilator acquired pneumonia.\\n Addiction: Tackling social isolation to aid the recovery of people of with dual diagnoses (2019):\\n £26,300\\n Social policy: UK and Japanese collaboration (2018): £7K from Daiwa Foundation for research\\n on victims of violent crime in the Japanese and English justice systems.\\n 4.3 Support for research impact\\n We have developed our impact infrastructure through support to staff (see impact group in section\\n 2) and by establishing facilities that provide public access to our expertise for research and\\n development. The Westmont Enterprise Hub, supporting and incubating innovative new start-ups\\n and spin-outs, maximizes commercial value and impact. Over the past 2 years it has supported\\n 50 start-ups, with 450+ members and connections to 500+ businesses. The West London Food\\n Innovation Centre is used to test and reformulate food products with research on sustainable\\n ‘green food’. It has engaged 95 SMEs over the past 2 years, of which 58 were start-ups. This led\\n to the creation of 58 new products and a projection of 150+ prospective jobs.\\n As described in section 2, the Communications department supports staff in promoting research\\n findings, and generating access to research users through bespoke events, press releases and\\n social media. School/College staff ensure that information about research findings promotes\\n external and public engagement. Examples include locally-focused activity, and high-profile\\n events such as the 2019 launch of our National Centre for Gang Research at the House of\\n Commons, the national promotion of our I-Hydrate project, or the Human Trafficking seminars (the\\n Ceserani series) at the Institute of Directors over a period of two years.\\n We engage with the public, including local communities, and are signatories to National Co-\\n ordinating Centre for Public Engagement (NCCPE) Manifesto for Public Engagement. This forms\\n part of our civic mission, as stated in our Public Benefit Statement, and clearly signaled in our KEF\\n narrative for Community and Public Engagement.\\n 4.4 Infrastructure and facilities\\n Our Estates and Facilities investment programme (over £170m over the period) has enabled us\\n to create social and open learning spaces and advanced simulation spaces for research; a library\\n without boundaries; a 300-seat flexible performance auditorium; a Sports Centre and a\\n postgraduate building for doctoral students (the Rami Ranger House). Sponsored by Lord Ranger\\n £0.5m), it was opened in 2019 and is a fully resourced space exclusively for the use of research\\n students. It offers spaces for collaborative working, socialising, supervision and mentoring on the\\n ground floor. The first floor provides individual workspaces and the second floor is used for\\n teaching and studying.\\n Over the period, we have opened a concrete laboratory for construction research; a ground-\\n penetrating radar laboratory; twelve computer laboratories; a built-environment studio; two allied\\n health simulation centres used in research on patient behaviour; four biomedical science\\n laboratories; two forensic investigation laboratories; a Virtual Reality laboratory; and numerous\\n performance and music studios. We have invested in a ‘Flight Pad’ – a Boeing 737-800 Flight\\n Simulator – which is used in feasibility studies for research on risk management.\\n The University has invested in ensuring that infrastructures are kept in top working order.\\n Equipment and facilities are assessed regularly for health and safety under our formal directives\\n and protocols; and rigorously inspected and tested by technicians to ensure they meet the required\\n technical standards.\\n                                                                                                 Page 7\\n\\n\\n                                                 Page 8\\n', 'w_env']\n",

      "['University of East London (UEL)\\n  1. Context and mission\\nContext and Mission\\nThe University of East London, ranked in the World Top 250 modern universities, is an anchor\\ninstitution:- our home borough, Newham, is one of the most deprived areas in the UK with 43% of\\nchildren living in poverty (CPAG 2018). The population is ethnically diverse: more than 70% of\\nresidents identify as Black, Asian, dual heritage or an ethnic group other than White British (ONS,\\n2019). This is reflected in the demographic of our students, 50% of whom are from Newham and\\nneighbouring boroughs and 44% have a non-UK nationality: 50% identify as other than White (rising\\nto 65% if exclusive of non-declarations); 25% are 30 years old or older. Undergraduates comprise\\n75%; 23% are PGT; and 1% are PGR (2019/20). Our local diverse profile has profound connections\\ninternationally, creating a global focus that places us in the top quartile for ‘international outlook’\\n(Times Higher Education Young University Rankings, 2020).\\nOf staff with significant responsibility for research (SRR), 31% do not identify as White; for teaching\\nstaff, this is 35%. We are ranked 1st in UK and 2nd in the world for ‘reducing inequalities’ (Times\\nHigher Education Impact Ranking 2020). We are 12th (nationally; 2nd in London) for Social Inclusivity\\nin the most recent Times League Table, evidencing our long-standing commitment to inclusion and\\nsocial mobility.\\nThe university is a member of the Million Plus Group, and is affiliated with London Higher, a network\\nof London HEIs, of which our Vice-Chancellor & President, Professor Amanda Broderick, is chair-\\nelect. She also chairs the Association of Commonwealth Universities Audit & Risk Committee. We\\nbelong to UCLPartners, a network of academic and clinical researchers and NHS bodies. Through\\nresearch grants and academic partnerships, we work locally and internationally with cultural\\ninstitutions (e.g, V&A, Museum of London). For KEF, our peer grouping is Group J.\\nOur vision is to be pioneers of future careers and deliver sustainable innovation. Our mission is to\\naccelerate inclusive talent by realising potential, wherever and whenever it is found and advance\\nknowledge and innovation to help people and planet.\\nInstitutional research focus\\nOur research is driven by values of the common good and tied to our goals outlined in our Vision\\n2028 strategy. Our history as an anchor institution in East London since 1892 remains reflected in a\\nculture drawn from and shaped by the population of East London, its global roots and its community\\nneeds. Our research is participatory, inclusive, empowering, and impactful by design.\\nThe disciplinary range is broad: we are returning academics to 13 UoAs, spanning science,\\nengineering, humanities and arts. The academic staffing comprises 575FTE, of which 249FTE (43%)\\nhave SRR. Our six schools are The Royal Docks School of Business and Law (RDSBL);\\nArchitecture, Computing & Engineering (ACE); Arts and Creative Industries (ACI); School of\\nEducation and Communities (EDUCOM); Psychology; Health, Sport and Bioscience (HSB). We also\\nhave two interdisciplinary research institutes: Sustainability Research Institute (SRI) and Institute for\\nConnected Communities (ICC).\\n                                                                                                 Page 1\\n\\n\\nWe are establishing enterprise career zones with major employers such as Amazon Web Services\\nto deliver new employment pathways, reskill workforce, promote research, knowledge exchange and\\nentrepreneurship, and support SME innovation. This is to ensure our research and teaching is\\nIndustry 4.0-ready, to address the opportunities of a world of artificial intelligence, quantum\\ncomputing and the Internet of Things; developments accelerated by Covid-19. We believe that social\\nmobility, diversity, equality and inclusion are prerequisites to an engaged and career-ready\\ncommunity. Our location and the profile of our community reminds us daily of the urgent need to find\\nimpactful solutions to significant local and global challenges.\\n 2. Strategy\\nOur 2015-20 strategic plan to be “London’s leading university for civic engagement” has been taken\\nfurther in our latest 10-year plan, Vision 2028. One of the four strategic objectives in this\\ntransformation strategy is “to increase the economic, social and cultural impact of our education,\\nresearch and enterprise activities to the communities we serve”.\\n  Research strategy: innovation with impact\\n What?

We strive for their active participation in the development and delivery of\\nresearch projects, emphasising co-production to deliver sustainable problem-solving. Our focus on\\ncommunities is not only in East London but also abroad: we are working with governments,\\nuniversities and NGOs in countries including (currently) India, Zambia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and\\nBrazil, stressing interdisciplinary collaborations that maximise impact, commercialisation and\\n                                                                                            Page 2\\n\\n\\ndissemination. We aim to recreate in other locations the research ecosystem that is maturing in East\\nLondon, by explicitly forming ‘impact platforms’ - defined as a place-based network of agencies and\\ninfrastructure, building on existing partnerships and forging new ones, to launch co-created projects\\nthat will have significant local benefit and global reach.\\nConsultation and collaboration mechanisms\\nWe have established formal and informal community consultation mechanisms within the university,\\nincluding a ‘Community Consultation Group’ with initial membership drawn from the neighbourhood\\nteams in the borough, the local clinical commissioning group and representatives of the voluntary,\\nfaith and community sectors in Newham. This group has identified the need for mechanisms to\\nfacilitate agile, responsive ways of working to address the barriers associated with community-\\nuniversity partnerships. We also engage locally through participation in external civic groups and\\ncollaborations: the PVC (Impact & Innovation) is a member of the Newham Covid-19 ‘Community\\nImpact Group’; our Public and Community Engagement Manager is part of Newham’s Volunteering\\nand Social Cohesion Strategy working group; and academics serve on Newham Council’s ‘Youth\\nSafety Action Group’ and the ‘Disproportionate Impacts of Covid 19’ task and finish group.\\nCommunity engagement activities in collaboration with Newham Council have included a series of\\ninitiatives that closely align to the strategic aims of both organisations. For example, we are a\\nstrategic delivery partner on Newham’s ‘50 Steps to Wellbeing’ initiative, co-designing and delivering\\nresearch to increase the health and wellbeing of Newham residents; we supported the Air Quality\\ninitiative, training student volunteers to champion behaviours to improve air quality; our researchers\\nworked with Newham Public Health to develop research-informed understanding of Covid-19 impact\\non Newham’s communities, contributing evidence to wider conversations about the disproportionate\\nimpact of Covid on Newham’s communities and analysis of the causes of vaccine hesitancy in certain\\ndemographic groups.\\nResearch Leadership\\nResearch strategy is driven by the university Impact & Innovation Committee (I&IC), chaired by the\\nPVC(I&I), with membership including the six school directors of I&I, all of whom are engaged in\\nproductive research. Other members of I&IC include professional services colleagues who support\\nresearch, including library and information services (LIS) and members of the Office for\\nPostgraduates, Research and Engagement (OPRE). The I&IC is responsible for development and\\nimplementation of the research strategy and generating ideas for strengthening the research base\\nand promoting research rigour and impact. School ’Impact champions’ drive impact activity at school\\nlevel, across a range of industry/business/community-engagement and in support of REF-impact\\nand recording case studies.\\nInformal mechanisms to provide leadership and develop leaders include a program of\\ninterdisciplinary ‘mixers’ (e.g., ‘East End Social’ for academics to discuss ongoing and planned\\nresearch in Newham; ‘Beers with Research’ hosted by senior staff for a PGR audience; ‘research\\nresolutions’ hosted by professional support staff for staff identifying as ‘developing’ or ‘re-engaging’).\\nThese activities moved online in March 2020, although a regular professoriate lunch, instigated in\\n2018 to encourage all senior researchers to take responsibility for research leadership, will\\nrecommence when conditions allow.\\n                                                                                                  Page 3\\n\\n\\nEnablers\\nResearcher Development Program (RDP) and Academic Progression Framework\\nThe RDP aims to develop researchers at all levels, including PGR students, ECR academics and\\nre-engaging academics. This program as well as the new Academic Progression Framework are\\ndiscussed in detail in Part 3.\\nPGR Studentships\\nAn early priority of our 2015-20 strategy was to engage undergraduate students in research, feeding\\ninto a ‘graduate accelerator scheme’, to enable high-performing undergraduates to proceed to post-\\ngraduate research. An initial target of 50 post-graduate studentships was exceeded by 2018 and the\\npercentage of timely PhD completions has increased each year since 2016 to stand at over 80%. In\\n2016, UEL joined the ESRC-funded “UCL, Bloomsbury and East London” (UBEL) Doctoral Training\\nPartnership, which has funded 6 studentships in the social sciences and psychology. The DTP gives\\nour post-graduate students access to the training offered to the wider cohort of PGR students at the\\npartner institutions. As part of Vision 2028, in addition to on-going PGR studentships, the University\\nis investing in a new academic apprenticeship scheme (the ‘VC&P Graduate Academic Assistant\\nprogramme’) to foster a diverse talent pipeline throughout the institution.\\nCore-funding and interdisciplinary institutes\\nOur research community operates through two multidisciplinary Institutes, research centres and\\nresearch groups, to which research funding is allocated.\\nThe Sustainability Research Institute was established in 2001 as one of the first of its kind in the UK.\\nIt has built an international reputation for conducting results-orientated innovation expertise, using\\nstate-of-art test sites and facilities, and exploiting cross-sectoral networks.\\nThe Institute for Connected Communities was established in 2020 when we identified the opportunity\\nto strengthen our research on community well-being through closer integration with world-leading\\nresearch on digital life and community cohesion. It evolved from the Institute of Health and Human\\nDevelopment (IHHD, est.2006), and is led by a Professor of Law and Criminology and expert in\\nonline harms and cyber-safety (following the departure of previous IHHD directors through retirement\\nand taking a new post elsewhere).\\nThe RIX Centre is a research and development unit, forming research and learning partnerships and\\nco-developing software and training to exploit the potential of digital tools for the benefit of our most\\nexcluded fellow citizens. SRI, ICC and RIX are allocated core funding, but are expected to generate\\nincome from contract research and consultancy, as well as grant funding.\\nResearch funding to schools is allocated by the DI&Is, working with the PVC(I&I) to ensure funding\\nsupports our core strategic aims. Spending plans balance infrastructure investment; support for the\\nresearch environment (e.g., seminars, conferences, workshops, events, public engagement\\nactivities); and project support (including internships and research expenses) intended to pump-\\nprime activity leading to a research funding bid. Each School sets strategic priorities for research\\nand develops a local plan for investment and development, as detailed in REF5b.\\nA central university fund (‘New Initiatives’) supports university-wide initiatives, including strategic\\ninfrastructure investment, sabbatical rotations, researcher development, initiatives to promote\\ninterdisciplinary working. The use of Higher Education Innovation Funding (HEIF) is intended\\nto create a sustainable platform for connecting and re-engaging business in East London. In a\\n                                                                                                  Page 4\\n\\n\\ncompetitive process, ten core mechanisms are designed to provide early investment – for example,\\ntravel funding or support for proof of concept work – as leverage for sustainable partnerships,\\nleading to KTP or Innovate UK funding. The Global Challenges Research Fund and the Strategic\\nPriorities Fund are also distributed competitively. We have prioritised funding for interdisciplinary\\nteams who focus on geographic locations (e.g., Zambia; India) where we already have an\\nestablished network of NGOs, local academics and public organizations.\\nFuture objectives 2021-2027\\nThe university signed (2019) the Concordat to Support Research Integrity, implementing the revised\\nConcordat AY2020-21. We are compliant with our obligations under the Concordat, including annual\\nreporting to support and strengthen research integrity. Using the UKRIO’s self-assessment tool, we\\nare reviewing our research practices, systems and policies, including training and monitoring, to\\nenhance compliance and provide assurance of best practice. Our strategic aim is to improve\\nresearch quality by fostering an open culture, not just with respect to open access publications\\nand open data, but also open research design and project planning. This is consistent with our\\nambition to be exemplary in our practice of co-creating research projects with the stakeholders and\\nbeneficiaries of the research. We audit the function of our research ethics committees in consultation\\nwith the joint Association of Research Managers and Administrators (ARMA) and UKRIO ‘Research\\nEthics Support and Review in Research Organisations’ guidance document.\\nAs well as being open, we will be outward-looking. We will continue to work to increase the visibility\\nand support for public and community engagement, signing the Manifesto for public\\nengagement and using the EDGE self-assessment tool provided by the NCCPE. Our ambition is to\\nmove from ‘Gripping’ to ‘Embedded’ in the next 18 months launching our next phase of development,\\nrenewing our commitment to engagement and strengthening our ability to listen and respond.\\nOur two enabling aims over the next six years are (1) to improve the research literacy of all academic\\nstaff, including those who do not have SRR but need to stay current with clinical or other professional\\npractice; (2) to increase the rigour of research though support and enabling mechanisms described,\\nso driving quality and impact. The goal is to be a leader in responsive-mode research, delivering\\ntime-critical sustainable innovation that improves lives, locally and globally\\n  3. People\\nOur staff base is one of the most diverse in the UK. For staff with SRR, 61% are British and amongst\\nthe other 39%, there are 37 different nationalities; 51% are female; 30% are Black, Asian and\\nMinority Ethnicity (‘BAME’) or did not declare; 6% declared a disability. Only 4% of staff with SRR\\nhave fixed-term contracts, but overall, 29% have ‘fractional contracts’ (i.e., part-time). There is a\\ngender and ethnicity divide in the distribution of fractional contracts: 42% of White women and 30%\\nof White men have fractional contracts, compared with 22% of BAME women and 6% of BAME men.\\nThis arises from vocational segregation: fractional contracts more common in architecture and the\\nperforming arts, which has a larger proportion of White staff, and less common in engineering and\\ncomputer science, with a larger proportion of BAME males. The figures for teaching and ‘other\\nprofessional’ staff are quite similar, with the exception being that there is a larger proportion of fixed\\nterm contracts (15%).\\nIn 2019, the university established an Office of Institutional Equity, acknowledging the fact that ED&I\\nis not just a matter for HR. The Dean for Institutional Equity is responsible for championing all aspects\\nof equality across teaching, research and engagement. The university is a ‘London Living Wage\\n                                                                                                   Page 5\\n\\n\\nEmployer’; holds Bronze status for Investors in People; has a Level Two Disability Confidence award;\\nis a Stonewall Diversity Champion; has ‘Commitment level’ for the London Healthy Workplace\\nCharter; holds an Athena SWAN Bronze award (2017); and a Bronze Race Equality Charter Mark\\n(2019). The Schools of Psychology, ACE and RDSBL all have Bronze Athena SWAN and are\\nworking towards Silver whilst also supporting other schools to establish SATs and develop action\\nplans.\\nWe aim to attract and retain high quality staff to align with our Purpose of Enhancing Lives, Changing\\nFutures, and are motivated by this and our Vision 2028 Strategy to create an inclusive and\\nsustainable future. The vocational/discipline gender/ethnicity divide noted above is being explicitly\\naddressed by investment in talent pipelines across the institution. New staff are inducted into\\nthe institutional research support, research ethics and integrity practices. ECRs are encouraged to\\nbid for university funding to pump prime their research. They are also encouraged to propose PhD\\nprojects and become members of PhD supervisory teams, supported by more experienced members\\nof research active staff.\\nResearcher Development Framework and Developing and Re-engaging Researchers\\nAs confirmed by an EU HR Excellence in Research Award, we support and manage career\\ndevelopment at all levels in alignment with the Concordat to Support the Career Development of\\nResearchers. An example is the Vitae-aligned Researcher Development Program (RDP), which\\ncomprises training and networking events; UEL’s Annual Research Conference; school and\\ndepartmental research meetings and seminar series; social media and public dissemination. Within\\nthe Schools, staff can apply for central and School research initiatives, this has led to multiple\\nfunding awards, including short sabbaticals, student internships, conference attendance and,\\nresearch expenses\\nThe university subscribes to the UK Research Integrity Office (UKRIO), and we take full advantage\\nof UKRIO’s specialist, subject-specific expertise across disciplines, including an annual training and\\nupdate session for members of the URES and the Researcher Development Framework. We also\\nsubscribed to the second edition of the suite of Epigeum’s online Research Integrity Modules, which\\nprovide comprehensive training informing users of the key concepts of research integrity and\\nidentifying all steps of the research process to deliver robust and consistent training in responsible\\nresearch conduct. It is mandatory for all postgraduate research students to complete the Research\\nIntegrity Modules, which are open to all researchers.\\n  4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\nIncome\\nUEL has averaged £2m annual research income across the census period, reflecting a diversity of\\nfunding sources. This includes a growing Innovate UK and KTP portfolio, as well as a range of\\nEuropean funding, spanning from FP7, through H2020 ERC and MSCA projects. Ongoing EU\\nprojects support research in UoA4, UoA16, UoA20 and UoA22 and these areas have the potential\\nto consolidate and grow: we have Horizon Europe bids are under evaluation or in development.\\nOur strategy has been to encourage more people to write smaller bids build a culture of success.\\nECRs, those identifying as developing or re-engaging researchers, or those with lower historical\\nbidding activity are particularly encouraged with, personal targeted support (GrantCraft; ReDs;\\nSchool DIIs).\\n                                                                                                Page 6\\n\\n\\nThe Research and Development Support (ReDS) team support grant capture through signposting\\nfunding calls, assisting with preparation of bids, including access to training and support from\\nGrantCraft (WRG Europe, Ltd.). This ensures bids are of high quality when submitted. QR funding\\nis used to gather proof-of-concept data when it will enhance the chances of success of a bid.\\nAcademic are encouraged to bid for smaller awards, including non-fEC. This is in recognition of the\\nfact that many of our community partners – including the local authority and local charities – have\\nneed of academic expertise without the means to pay fEC rates. This approach to subsidise research\\nprojects serves a strategic objective: namely, to forge partnerships that deliver measurable\\neconomic, social or cultural impacts from research engagement. Furthermore, many initially small-\\nvalue projects lead to larger collaborations or even response-mode bids.\\nThe overall number of applications has remained steady and the high success rate has been\\nmaintained (2017-18 = 122 bids, 46% success; 2018-19 = 111 bids; 38% success; 2019-20 = 124\\nbid; 41% success). ReDs is working to increase bid volume and value, from diverse sources, without\\ncompromising success rate.\\nUniversity Infrastructure and Facilities\\nThe university is situated across three sites in the London Borough of Newham: the site of the original\\ntechnical college in Stratford; a campus at the Royal Albert Docks (1999); and the University Square\\nStratford (2013). When it opened in 1999, the campus at the Royal Docks was the first new university\\ncampus built in London for over 50 years.\\nUniversity Square Stratford was a collaboration between UEL and Birkbeck, University of London,\\nfunded by HEFCE, which opened in 2013. USS houses specialist studio spaces, a suite of music\\nand multi-media recording and production rooms, rehearsal rooms and live ensemble/band\\nrecording and control rooms. These facilities are supported by staff offices, teaching spaces,\\ncomputer labs, and a technical store. The Docklands and Stratford campuses have specialist science\\nand engineering labs as detailed in REF5b.\\nThe Library is split across the Docklands and Stratford campuses, that latter located in a dedicated,\\n24-hour access, modern building that opened in 2015 at a cost of £14.7 million. The library’s\\nextensive archival collections include Olympic and sports history (‘British Olympic Association\\nArchive’; ‘When Saturday Comes’ football fanzine archive); refugee and forced migration studies\\n(‘Refugee Council Archive’, plus 11 other named collections covering refugee and migration issues\\nin the Living Refugee Archive; theatre and performing arts (‘Hackney Empire Archive’); the East\\nLondon Studies collection, including ‘Hidden Histories Archive’, comprising over 4,000 oral histories\\ncurated by Eastside Community Heritage; as well as the ‘UEL Institutional Archive’. UEL Archives\\nhas undertaken several civic engagement projects funded through the UEL Civic Engagement Fund,\\nincluding documenting the history of the Royal Docks and life histories of displaced persons. We\\nwork in collaboration with London Stadium Learning on a Heritage Lottery Funded project entitled\\n`Passing the Flame’, working with local schools and documenting the intergenerational legacies of\\nthe three London Olympic Games (1908, 1948 and 2012). Recently, we have been using virtual\\ntechnologies to enhance both academic and public engagement with our collections e.g., working\\nwith JISC and JSTOR on a project to make materials from our East London Theatre Archive (ELTA)\\naccessible virtually.\\n                                                                                               Page 7\\n\\n\\nBeing located in the East End of London, with significant levels of deprivation but also undergoing\\nphenomenal economic regeneration and with emerging creative industries, we inform and influence\\nthe evolution of strategic infrastructure developments, for example having input into the local\\nregeneration planning. We are networked with key creative organisations, including Stratford Circus\\nYouth Zone, East London Dance, and Here East; professional theatre companies; the V&A, National\\nYouth Theatre, Museum of London and WAC Arts. As such, our location provides living laboratory\\nand is both inspiration for, participatory with, and beneficiary of our research.\\nSupport for researchers\\nThe Office for Postgraduates, Research and Engagement (OPRE) provides research support across\\nthe institution. It incorporates the pre- and post-award funding support team, Research Development\\nand Support (ReDS), who work closely with the Head of Public and Community Engagement to\\nensure proactive facilitation of networks, not only for securing funding, but also in developing\\npartnerships and collaborations with diverse stakeholders to ensure that our research is responsive\\nand relevant to local and global communities. This ensures our research reaches beyond the usual\\nresearch sharing environments that are typical in academia: the stakeholders of our research include\\nthe communities, advocacy groups, charities and NGOs, local government, policy makers and other\\nindividuals and organisation. OPRE includes the Head of Ethics and Compliance who administers\\nthe university Research Ethics Committee and is responsible for staff development and training\\naround ethics and research integrity. She oversees the action plans around the Researcher\\nDevelopment and Research Integrity concordats. The Graduate School is also part of OPRE,\\nsupporting the training and development of post-graduate researchers, including administration of\\nthe University Research Excellence Studentships and university research internships. We are a\\nsignatory to the San Francisco DORA, and our commitment to open research is supported by a post\\nin LIS dedicated to Open Science.\\nOpen Research\\nOur strategic priority to promote open research supports reproducibility by ensuring that research\\nresults, methods, materials, analysis and primary data are made available. The UEL Research\\nRepository is home to research outputs including journal publications, proceedings, practice-based\\nmaterials, theses, and research data. The repository moved to Haplo in 2019, and has increased\\nengagement: in 2020, there was an increase of 24% in deposits and 35% downloads, from over 200\\ncountries and territories. The repository allows us to mint DOIs for datasets, theses, and other UEL\\npublications, including Open Access journals in social science, business and education.\\nIn 2020, we used the annual ‘Love Data Week’ to highlight our policy of open data. In 2021, a more\\nsubdued online event focussed on data ethics. UEL’s latest Research Data Management Policy\\n(2019) requires Data Management Plans (also a mandatory condition of the ethics approval process)\\nand the sharing of data, to be ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. UEL also has an\\nelectronic data archiving service provided by Arkivum, enabling us to meet funder and institutional\\nrequirements on data security and integrity. Both systems are ISO27001 certified and allow long-\\nterm secure storage and management of research data, including sensitive data as well as other\\ninstitutional assets such as the library archive’s digital collections.\\n                                                                                              Page 8\\n\\n\\nFacilitation of impact\\nAcademics are encouraged to document public and civic engagement activities (including, but not\\nlimited to, research) and measures of impact by through the annual Performance and Development\\nReview (PDR) and the new (from AY2020-21) Academic Progression Framework. Since 2016, the\\nuniversity has held a site-licence for Vertigo Ventures Impact Tracker, and we have a core of ‘early\\nadopters’ who are championing its use. Nevertheless, our civic ethos is embedded, so that much of\\nthis activity is about surfacing and recording it, rather than needing to germinate or grow it.\\nFuture objectives 2021-2027\\nOpen science, which is based on the bedrock of community engagement, will remain a key strategic\\naim that drives development and delivery of research projects, through co-production to deliver\\nsustainable problem solving.\\nPlans for the development of our campus’ involve concentrating allied health research in the clinical\\nlabs in Stratford; making Docklands the focus for sustainability research and the creative industries,\\nincluding arts, architecture, engineering and digital innovation. Complementing the development\\nplans for the university estate, we are launching a transformational ‘Digital First’ project. The website\\nis being completely rebuilt, with the new site being launched in May 2021. We intend to use the new\\nwebsite to better showcase the expertise that is available to external stakeholders, with opportunities\\nto engage with us and for us to promote the impact of our research.\\nThe University of East London is committed to enhancing lives and will focus research investment\\non the areas where we have strength and potential to make the greatest difference. An organizing\\nprincipal is measurable progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: SDG3\\nGood Health and Wellbeing; SDG10 Reduced Inequalities; SDG11 Sustainable Cities and\\nCommunities; SDG16 Social inclusion and Justice.

      "[\"University of Stirling\\n1. Context and mission\\n     The University of Stirling is a globally significant centre of interdisciplinary research,\\n     located in Scotland and impacting societies worldwide. Our research focuses on making\\n     a difference to society, people's lives and the environment. Lord Robbins, our first\\n     Chancellor, championed the nurturing of skilled people and the application of their\\n     research expertise as critical components of building societal wealth and wellbeing. Since\\n     its foundation in 1967, Stirling has built upon these purposeful objectives, and they\\n     continue to guide us in an increasingly turbulent world. The strategic objectives of the\\n     University are rooted in our values. We strive to unlock the potential of our 14,000 students\\n     (3,800 postgraduates) and 1,500 staff, leveraging their knowledge and skills to shape the\\n     world in a positive way. The University is an international organisation: 20% of our\\n     students are from overseas and more than 120 nationalities are represented in our staff\\n     and student body.\\n     To achieve our objectives, we have organised ourselves as a community of scholars\\n     whose purpose is to create new knowledge, deepen our understanding of the world\\n     around us, and share our insights at home and abroad. We continually mobilise the\\n     radical, innovative culture of the University to make a global impact through our research,\\n     our partnerships, and our 96,000-strong alumni community, providing leadership in\\n     countries, businesses, and communities across the globe. We communicate what we\\n     have learned to the wider world via appropriate channels, working in partnership with\\n     governments, business, and industry, the public and third sectors to identify and meet the\\n     changing needs of society.\\n     Exemplars of our actions resulting in purposeful change include our leadership in the fight\\n     against tobacco-related harm; ensuring the safety of food supply for vulnerable\\n     communities through sustainable aquaculture (Queen’s Anniversary Prize 2019); and\\n     working to improve the quality of lives of the millions of people with dementia across the\\n     world. We are an anchor institution for the Forth Valley Region in central Scotland,\\n     supporting more than 10,000 jobs, generating £200m of wages and adding £380m to the\\n     regional economy every year. We lead the innovation workstream of the Stirling and\\n     Clackmannanshire City Region Growth Deal (2020-2031), securing £46m of direct\\n     government investment to deliver research with impact through the National Aquaculture\\n     Technology and Innovation Hub, Scotland’s International Environment Centre, and an\\n     Intergenerational Living Innovation Hub.\\n     The University is structured into five faculties: Arts and Humanities; Health Sciences and\\n     Sport; Natural Sciences; Social Sciences and Stirling Management School. Faculties are\\n     organised into academic divisions and operate Faculty Research Centres, where the\\n     scale of activity makes this appropriate. There are three formally established University\\n     Research Centres: The Institute for Social Marketing and Health; the Nursing, Midwifery\\n     and Allied Health Professions Research Unit; and the Salvation Army Centre for Addiction\\n     Services and Research. Additionally, the University’s Dementia Services Development\\n     Centre enhances dementia care globally through research-based consultancy and\\n     training. The Innovation Park offers premises and business support to over 70 firms in\\n     key sectors, supported by the University’s research, and is home to the University’s\\n     innovation and enterprise programme team.\\n                                                                                           Page 1\\n\\n\\n2. Strategy\\n     Our 2016-21 University Strategic Plan restates the importance of the original\\n     underpinnings of our institutional identity in formulating our approach to research\\n     excellence. Our current Research Strategy, “Research Responding to Society’s Needs”,\\n     is aligned to the University’s Strategic Plan. It focuses on developing capacity to deliver\\n     our established interdisciplinary and mission-oriented approach to research that tackles\\n     real-world problems, identifies creative solutions, and translates them into practice.\\n     In pursuit of our strategy, research is organised through mission-oriented themes and\\n     programmes, which are designed to facilitate and nurture interdisciplinary, impactful\\n     research through co-production and collaboration across the University community.\\n     These themes and programmes reflect the University’s leading areas of excellence,\\n     including the wellbeing of ageing populations, the impacts and implications on society of\\n     the rapidly changing natural world, and the contemporary importance to identity and\\n     belonging of heritage and our shared connection with the past. They are closely aligned\\n     with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and foster the collaborations\\n     required to tackle local and global issues over the long term. Our research themes are:\\n     \\uf0b7     Cultures, Communities and Society\\n           This theme explores social justice at different scales and in varied places, influencing\\n           the agenda for policy and practice around the globe. Cross-cutting concerns include\\n           understanding how to: empower communities by enhancing their understanding of\\n           their cultural past to positively influence their future; providing a safe and secure\\n           home for every individual; critically challenging the societal changes brought about\\n           by digital media. The specific research programmes in this theme are: Home, Housing\\n           and Community; Cultural Heritage; Digital Society and Culture.\\n     \\uf0b7     Global Security and Resilience\\n           This theme has the cross-cutting goal of supporting the delivery of a sustainable and\\n           secure way of living for the world’s growing population. We pioneer research that\\n           addresses global hunger, climate change and clean technologies, sustainable\\n           aquaculture, and environmental protection. The research programmes in this theme\\n           are: Extreme Events; Environmental Change; Global Food Security; Human Security,\\n           Conflict and Co-operation; Being Connected.\\n     \\uf0b7     Living Well\\n           This theme focuses on supporting decision makers and institutions to improve well-\\n           being in a range of local and global contexts; combatting age- and gender-based\\n           inequalities; and supporting people to maintain, attain or regain good physical and\\n           mental health. The research programmes in this theme are: Ageing and Dementia;\\n           Health and Behaviour; Mobile Cognition; Contextual Learning in Humans and\\n           Machines.\\n     We are progressively strengthening our priority research themes and programmes in\\n     pursuit of our core objective of Enhancing Research Excellence. Each programme has\\n     dedicated academic leadership and a designated Research Development Officer. They\\n     benefit from direct financial investment to stimulate and accelerate their development.\\n     They are the primary lens through which we present and communicate our research\\n     strengths and priorities. By design, our themes and programmes drive impactful,\\n     collaborative, interdisciplinary and international research.\\n     Our research strategy includes an explicit focus on ‘Partnership and Communication’ to\\n     support our commitment to translating research insights into practical solutions. We have\\n                                                                                             Page 2\\n\\n\\n     extended and strengthened our research and innovation partnerships with academia,\\n     industry, business, policymakers, regulatory bodies, health and social care organisations,\\n     and wider communities. As demonstrated through our impact case studies, Stirling\\n     researchers have led collaborations delivering transformational impact with a very wide\\n     range of stakeholders.\\n     Implementation of our research strategy internationally is principally achieved through\\n     focusing on a range of institutional partnerships in different parts of the world where we\\n     have established or are developing relationships, such as UNESP in Sao Paulo region,\\n     Brazil. The partnerships are managed by dedicated teams that share information and\\n     intelligence on collaborative research priorities that match our strategic approach. We\\n     achieve sustainability in these collaborations by broadening and deepening their activities\\n     through formal arrangements, including dual PhD programmes, staff exchange, and\\n     tailored pump-priming funding for Global Challenges Research Fund projects. Our global\\n     alumni network plays a major role in developing and supporting international research\\n     collaborations with academic institutions, businesses and other organisations worldwide.\\n     Institutional leadership of research has been significantly strengthened during the\\n     assessment period. Under the overarching leadership of the Deputy Principal for\\n     Research, new positions - Dean for Research Engagement and Performance and Dean\\n     of the Institute for Advanced Studies - have been created to lead deeper research\\n     collaboration across the University. Each Faculty has an Associate Dean for Research,\\n     supported by a Director of Postgraduate Research, and Impact Champions. The\\n     University’s Dean for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion works directly with the research\\n     leadership team to promote diversity in research careers. A Research Environment Group\\n     has been established under the University Research Committee, with a specific\\n     responsibility for research culture, sustainability and enhancing the support available for\\n     researchers across the institution.\\n     As a key strategic objective, the profile of the University’s research and impact has been\\n     enhanced significantly over the assessment period. Recognising our responsibilities to\\n     contribute to informed public debate, we have deliberately targeted promotion of research\\n     outcomes and impacts to non-academic audiences, working in partnership with The\\n     Conversation to promote media access to our research. Our research outputs have been\\n     featured in more than 9,000 news stories across 72 countries, while our work is cited in\\n     almost 2,000 policy documents in 22 countries. We have increased total Altmetric\\n     mentions from 5,762 in 2014 to 35,286 in 2019. To facilitate interaction with policymakers,\\n     we introduced a Public Policy Hub in April 2019. The Hub holds a growing library of\\n     research-based policy briefings, permanently available for use by policymakers and other\\n     stakeholders. The policy briefing documents have been downloaded more than 5,000\\n     times, while the blog provides research-based commentary across a range of topical and\\n     emerging policy debates. The University is also engaged with the Universities Policy\\n     Engagement Network (UPEN) and Scottish Policy and Research Exchange (SPRE),\\n     providing increasing opportunities for collaboration with policymakers in the UK’s\\n     parliaments and governments.\\n     Research Integrity\\n     The University is committed to the highest ethical standards in research and has signed\\n     the Concordat to Support Research Integrity. We actively promote a culture of best\\n     practice and integrity in all our research through the core values of honesty, rigour, open\\n     communication, care, and respect. To safeguard the interests of researchers, participants\\n     and funding bodies, research within the University only proceeds after detailed scrutiny\\n     by one of our three internal Research Ethics Panels. The Animal Welfare and Ethical\\n     Review Body examines all research involving animals and the NHS, Invasive or Clinical\\n     Research panel considers health-related projects and physical interventions involving\\n                                                                                         Page 3\\n\\n\\n     human subjects. All other projects are considered by the General University Ethics Panel.\\n     All three panels have an external lay chair, operate independently of research\\n     management in the University, are subject to audit by the University’s internal auditors,\\n     and are overseen by the University Research Ethics Committee, which reports to the\\n     University Court. Where appropriate, ethical scrutiny is also sought from external bodies\\n     including the NHS Research Ethics Service.\\n     The University subscribes to the UK Research Integrity Office and is a member of the\\n     Scottish Research Integrity Network. The University’s culture of research integrity is\\n     supported by an institutional Research Integrity and Governance Manager, based within\\n     Research and Innovation Services. Dedicated training is available to all staff and students,\\n     covering peer review, ethical approval, plagiarism, authorship, and collaborative research.\\n     A full range of web-based briefing and reference materials are also available. In 2020, the\\n     University completed implementation of an online Ethics Review Manager system to\\n     support researchers in seeking ethics approval while enhancing best practice in research\\n     integrity.\\n     Open Research\\n     The University of Stirling pioneered open access to research through the establishment\\n     in 2008 of STORRE, our online repository of research outputs (including doctoral theses)\\n     and DataSTORRE, our online repository of research datasets. We support the Concordat\\n     on Open Research Data and the UK Research and Innovation principles on open\\n     research. The University also ensures research data is GDPR-compliant. We continue to\\n     support an ambitious open research publishing programme and are committed to\\n     strengthening access via the green and gold routes. Our Article Processing Charge Fund\\n     supports the costs of publishing research papers funded by Research Council grants and\\n     open access publishing via the gold route. Funding is granted automatically upon\\n     application from any primary author publishing in a fully open access journal.\\n     The University has signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment\\n     (DORA) and established a working group to develop a fair and transparent mechanism\\n     for monitoring and reporting research performance. This will be applied to staff\\n     recruitment and appraisal of research performance.\\n3. People\\n     The opening paragraph of our Strategic Plan 2016-21 states that:\\n     “Our aim is to unlock the full potential of our students and staff, so that they can use their\\n     knowledge and skills to shape the world in a positive way.”\\n     The wellbeing of our scholarly community is central to the University’s mission and values;\\n     we strive to create an environment where everyone is treated with respect, their abilities\\n     are valued, and where support is provided for those staff and students with specific needs.\\n     Researcher development is facilitated by the University’s “Achieving Success”\\n     programme that, through structured annual discussions, enables academic staff and their\\n     line manager to review and plan future research, impact and teaching activities. The\\n     process produces an agreed set of priorities and objectives, with an individual programme\\n     of development and training designed to support their attainment. Achieving Success\\n     facilitates progress towards promotion for researchers.

The programme maps to\\n     the Vitae Researcher Development Framework and follows the principles contained in the\\n     Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers.\\n     Throughout the assessment period, the University has enhanced support for our research\\n     community through the following initiatives:\\n     Institute for Advanced Studies\\n     The Institute for Advanced Studies delivers the University’s Researcher Development\\n     Programme. It provides cohesion and depth to the quality of postgraduate research (PGR)\\n     support and promotes development and collaboration across the research community.\\n     Specific support for postgraduate research (PGR) students, whether embarking on a\\n     research career or preparing for a non-academic position, includes:\\n     \\uf0b7    A full programme of Researcher Development and Skills Training.\\n     \\uf0b7    Maximising opportunities for cross-disciplinary research, practice and social\\n          interaction (for example, through Pint of Science events) outside of their main area\\n          of study.\\n     \\uf0b7    A PGR-instigated Interdisciplinarity Research Network\\n     \\uf0b7    Focusing on identifying new, innovative research opportunities across disciplines by\\n          engaging with staff including via the Supervising Doctoral Studies programme.\\n     \\uf0b7    Enhanced policies and practices through the institutional Code of Practice for\\n          Research Degrees and Staff-Student Concordat for PGRs.\\n     \\uf0b7    Deepening and widening the range of research development and training\\n          opportunities to create the innovative “CPD4PhD”, a rounded portfolio of activities\\n          students can undertake throughout their doctoral career alongside their thesis. On\\n          completion of the programme, students will receive a PGCert in Professional\\n          Practice alongside their doctoral degree.\\n     The Institute also offers an open programme of enhanced skills training and development\\n     opportunities for research staff. This includes:\\n     \\uf0b7    Individual induction and training plans, allowing researchers to select the training\\n          which most benefits their own professional development.\\n     \\uf0b7    The Stirling Crucible programme of three two-day residential “skills labs” designed\\n          to help researchers innovate in research while building collaborations with their\\n          peers from different disciplines and non-academic organisations.\\n     \\uf0b7    Dedicated events for mid-career researchers leveraging collaborations with\\n          government and industry.\\n     \\uf0b7    A development programme to facilitate the progression to leadership roles.\\n     \\uf0b7    Advanced Study Groups – dedicated time for short-life, cross-faculty groups to\\n          pursue a targeted research objective.\\n     \\uf0b7    Fellowships for visiting researchers to stimulate new cross-disciplinary\\n          perspectives.\\n     Research Environment Group\\n     The University has enhanced researcher support with the establishment of a Research\\n     Environment Group (REG), reporting directly to the University Research Committee. The\\n     REG proactively engages with our research community to gather ideas on how the\\n     University can improve its research environment - and build them into its ongoing\\n     programme of researcher support. The REG oversees implementation of the University’s\\n                                                                                          Page 5\\n\\n\\n     action plan under the HR Excellence in Research Award (which was renewed in 2019)\\n     and the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers.\\n     The University’s progress in enhancing the research environment has been measured by\\n     the REG through the biennial Careers in Research Online Survey (CROS) and Principal\\n     Investigators and Research Leaders Survey (PIRLS). Staff responding to the surveys\\n     have consistently reported that their contributions have been valued across a range of\\n     research activity, and that they have felt integrated with the research community at\\n     divisional and institutional level and supported in their personal and career development.\\n     All feedback is discussed at the REG with actions proposed in response. Further\\n     engagement and feedback is communicated weekly through an online Research\\n     Environment Digest.\\n     Festival of Research\\n     Launched in 2018, we celebrate our research through an annual Festival of Research: a\\n     week-long intensive series of events showcasing the innovative research at the\\n     University, and a mixed programme of workshops, award ceremonies, plenary and panel\\n     sessions including public lectures involving a range of external presenters, funders, and\\n     partners to stimulate new ideas and strengthen our research culture. The Festival\\n     promotes new interdisciplinary collaborations across and beyond the University. It forms\\n     a key element in our year-round researcher development programme. The Festival is\\n     complemented by a series of ‘Mini Festival’ sessions throughout the year on subjects\\n     including ethics and research integrity.\\n     Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI)\\n     The University is committed to ensuring that no individual is disadvantaged as a\\n     consequence of their age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership,\\n     pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. We aim to\\n     promote a culture inclusive of all sections of society which is free from discrimination and\\n     unfair treatment.\\n     As well as being documented in our Strategic Plan, the University’s commitment to\\n     equality is reflected in the institutional Equality Outcomes 2017-2021; our Gender Action\\n     Plan, produced in line with guidance from the Scottish Funding Council; and in our\\n     commitment to the Athena SWAN Charter.\\n     The University has an Athena SWAN Bronze award. We have also received Bronze\\n     awards for the Faculty of Health Sciences and Sport, the Division of Biological and\\n     Environmental Sciences (Faculty of Natural Sciences), the Faculty of Social Sciences,\\n     and the Institute of Aquaculture (Faculty of Natural Sciences).\\n     All faculties and professional service areas have designated Equality Champions who\\n     take forward the equality and diversity agenda in their area. They form the Equality Action\\n     Forum - chaired by the Dean for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion - which helps raise\\n     awareness and promote best practice across the institution as well as overseeing and\\n     monitoring the implementation of the University’s strategy for equality and diversity\\n     (equality outcomes) and ensuring compliance with statutory equality duties. An equality\\n     impact assessment is undertaken on all policies and strategies developed in the\\n     University.\\n     The University offers a wide range of EDI, dignity and wellbeing programmes including:\\n      \\uf0b7   Equality and Diversity and Tackling Gender Based Violence training.\\n                                                                                          Page 6\\n\\n\\n      \\uf0b7   A Walking Wellbeing Programme, which combines information with practical\\n          activities.\\n      \\uf0b7   Mental health training and support, including a Mental Health First Aid programme\\n      \\uf0b7   An Employee Assistance Programme, including out-of-hours counselling and mental\\n          health support.\\n      \\uf0b7   A zero-tolerance approach to bullying and harassment, backed by a new dignity at\\n          work and study policy.\\n      \\uf0b7   Tailored support for female staff, including a two-day personal and professional\\n          development programme (Stepping Stones), promotion training, and a Women in\\n          Leadership development programme.\\n      \\uf0b7   The national Aurora women’s leadership programme - in which the University has\\n          participated for more than 10 years, with 121 women having successfully\\n          graduated. A five-year participant review identified that 76% of participants had\\n          successfully achieved promotion or a progressive career change since undertaking\\n          the programme.\\n      \\uf0b7   Unconscious Bias training for key staff in senior management positions as well as\\n          individual staff who may be involved with areas including academic promotions,\\n          Athena SWAN, REF2021 preparations.\\n     The University has sector-leading representation of female leaders as Deans of Faculty.\\n     Four out of our five faculties - including both that fall under the Science, Technology,\\n     Engineering, Maths and Medicine (STEMM) umbrella - have been led by women during\\n     the assessment period. In addition, 51% of Faculty Executive members are women, and\\n     50% of University Court members are women, a rise from 44% in 2017/18. Several staff\\n     and student-run groups demonstrate the culture of inclusion and embeddedness of\\n     equality and diversity activity. These include an LGBTQ+ staff-led support network,\\n     comprising academic and professional support staff who identify as LGBTQ+. Our\\n     Women in STEM society runs activities and workshops, for and led by staff members,\\n     such as the “20 women in 2020” social media campaign that shared the experiences of\\n     20 role models from across the university at different career stages.\\n     To support staff with caring responsibilities, a flexible working scheme is offered by the\\n     University for all staff with a minimum 26 weeks’ continuous service. For academic staff\\n     returning from maternity or adoption leave, their return to work is facilitated through buyout\\n     of teaching commitments for a period of six months, to enable research development. Our\\n     campus is highly accessible for people with disabilities and tailored support is provided\\n     for researchers with additional needs.\\n     The University has a low population of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) staff -\\n     slightly lower than the Scottish benchmarks National Census (2011) - with an average 5%\\n     of employees identifying as BAME (51% of which are male and 49% are females). The\\n     University is developing a new anti-racism and racial equality strategy, and developing an\\n     array of resources designed to raise awareness of black history and culture and the\\n     contributions of black people to our university and wider society, and encourage\\n     discussions about race, racism and tackling racial injustice.\\n4. Income, infrastructure and facilities\\n   Research Grants and Contracts\\n   We regard external research funding as a key enabler of our research activity and capacity,\\n   and therefore continue to pursue a trajectory of growth in research grant and contract\\n   income. We have, in the assessment period, transformed our approach to research funding\\n                                                                                            Page 7\\n\\n\\n   and have deliberately pursued a strategy of applying for large-scale, mission-oriented,\\n   interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary grants. This approach has borne fruit; the value of our\\n   research applications has increased over the assessment period by 116%, from a base\\n   £43.6 million in 15/16 to £94.1m in 19/20. The value of research grant and contract awards\\n   has grown throughout the period of our Strategic Plan, from £8.8m in 2016/17 to £16m in\\n   2019-20. We expect further significant growth in 20/21: as of January 2021, we have\\n   already exceeded the £16m total of the previous year and have confidence that we will\\n   achieve £23m by the end of the academic year.\\n   Professional Services\\n   Research and Innovation Services (RIS) is focused on directly supporting the University's\\n   strategic objectives in all areas of research and innovation and has a broad range of\\n   expertise with many staff holding doctorates. In addition, other professional services\\n   provide specialist support for key areas of activity, including library and information\\n   systems, research finance, research laboratories and other facilities, human resources and\\n   organisational development.\\n   In RIS, the Research Development and Performance Team supports: the development of\\n   research activities, from small developmental funding for early career researchers, to large-\\n   scale programme funding applications; the establishment of related networks externally;\\n   postgraduate research opportunities and researcher development. They support the priority\\n   themes and programmes with dedicated Research Development Officers. The Research\\n   Integrity and Governance Team leads on ensuring that all activity meets the highest ethical\\n   standards through appropriate policy, procedures and support for expert review. The\\n   Contracts Team leads on the provision of support for the contractual elements of research\\n   and innovation funding, intellectual property considerations, partnerships and\\n   collaborations. The Research Systems Team oversees all information systems used in\\n   supporting the research lifecycle. These include the Worktribe Research Management\\n   System, the Ethics Review Manager system and all web-based support resources in the\\n   University Research Toolkit. Preparations for the University's submission to the Research\\n   Excellence Framework are coordinated through the Research Assessment and Impact\\n   Team. The Innovation and Enterprise Team leads on the support for commercial aspects\\n   of our research and our enterprise agenda, including delivering an Enterprise Programme\\n   for those who are interested in developing innovative ideas, start-ups and skills to engage\\n   in enterprise activity and connecting with a range of knowledge exchange activities\\n   including Interface, which promotes academic business links across Scotland, and the\\n   UKRI Knowledge Transfer Partnership scheme. The University’s City Region and Growth\\n   Deal programme is delivered through the Innovation and Enterprise team.\\n   Research Investment Fund\\n   Competitive internal research funding schemes – Connect, Connect+, Spark, and Escalator\\n   - are provided by the University and are available to all academic staff to support the\\n   development of project applications. The awards range from £5,000 to £20,000 of direct\\n   costs, depending on the scheme applied for. Connect supports discussion and exchange\\n   of ideas and facilitates interactions between researchers and stakeholders; while Connect+\\n   builds on Connect, supporting meetings and/or workshops to consolidate relationships and\\n   collaborations and facilitate funding applications. Spark provides pump-priming for\\n   research projects where these may lead to larger funding applications.

    "\"Why did you chose the visualisation you did, with reference to the type of data you are visualising?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer: I chose to visualise the 'mean token use' data with a bar chat. The main reason for this choice is that this visualisation is really easy for anyone to understand, it shows result without any explanation. By sorting the mean values in descending order it helps to show comparison and immediate contrast between the different universities. The use of distinct colors highlights the two groups and the choice of colors too, the red stands for the worse universities in comparison with Kent and the blue for the better ones. The two horizontal dashed lines provide reference point to compare each individual universities with the average of the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Do you see any patterns in your visualisation of the data frame `unit_df`?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer: The mean values of the two groups are almost the same even if the mean for the better group is slightly higher (4.40) than the worse group (4.27). Overall, the mean token use values are between 3.80 to 4.90 and most of them are around 4. It suggests that universities with a better score than Kent may be using more repetitions in their text though the difference remains minimal. It also suggests that the diversity in topics are similar from one university to an other. When looking at the bottom and top of the visualisation, it contains a mix of better and worse environments than Kent, it doesn't show a clear dominance by one of the two groups. We may think that the mean token use is maybe not correlated to the environment scores. There is no clear pattern but most of the b_env universities are grouped around the mean and for the w_env they are a bit more diversified, there is less consistency in their writing."
